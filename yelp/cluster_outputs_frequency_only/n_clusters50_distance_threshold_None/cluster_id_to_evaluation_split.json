        "Been here a couple of times and the view is so awesome. \\n\\nThe club itself is gross- like San Jose downtown gross. I can't believe people buy tables here... I guess if you MUST fit in some hip hop into your Vegas trip this is the place to go, but you also get the same hip hop crowd.  The view in itself is worth 3 stars though.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)",
        "Came here on a Friday night to have a drink at the prohibition bar located in the casino. I was impressed by how the dealers and dancers in the middle of the floor never stopped shaking and bouncing. It really helped in keeping the energy up in the room. The tables were busy and so was the bar, but the service was still good. Additionally, their vallet is always super nice.",
        "The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location",
        "not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.",
        "By far one of the Top 5 poker rooms in Las Vegas. Plenty of tables, good action, and good overall room. My go to spot.",
        "Eat lunch here today, ordered a beer any tacos, the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip, the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill... Thanks for the cut lip.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "I love this restaurant! The portions are generous, and the food is flavorful and filling. The service was awesome and they were definitely attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe wait time for the food was not long at all, but to keep us entertained, they have books and games at the tables to pass the time. Such a fun idea.\\n\\nI highly recommend the fish and chips or the blue cheese bacon burger!",
        "The fish taco salad tasted ok but with a fountain drink my bill came to $15.10 and I was still hungry.",
        "Sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!",
        "Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...",
        "Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.",
        "The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \\\"OK\\\" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "I got my Sonic fix, so there is a couple stars for ya.\\n\\nSadly our fries were VERY undercooked, I didn't get any mustard with my plain hot dog, and we didn't get any napkins.\\n\\nThese are fast food basics, people.",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Food wasn't that great. I went there alone. Still they charged me 18% gratuity and about 30% tip. That's 50% in addition to the bill. I ended up paying 30$ for my lunch.",
        "I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\\n\\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\\n\\nI would go back, but with low expectations.",
        "Loved the drinks but the service was horrible. We ordered an appetizer that never came (and was later put on the bill). I would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the server's attitude.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.",
        "We had a nice dinner,, but my wife got food posioning..  She woke up 4am and was ill and continued to be ill that day..  Could keep nothing down and very dehiderated.   The management while polite seemed to think I was shaking them down when I asked for a partial discount off our $300 bill..   Rather hard to accept such an event when dining at such a place..  Better luck..",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  The socially awkward cashier. Punch card is very specific to certain plates even if you're spending more. The random coin operated sticker/toy machine by the door.\\n\\nLIKE  The availability of low carb options. The Hawaiian music playing in the background. Choice of mini or regular size. Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",
        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings.",
        "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.",
        "I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.",
        "The only place you can drink beer is inside this little pen, like I'm a damn bull. The beer choices they have are terrible, only two. The beer they do have tastes terrible. Cash only for the beer. Cash only for the parking. Terrible cellular signal. What a dump.",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "Friendly service, had high expectations from the review on here. I ordered the carne asada nachos. The chips themselves were extremely greasy, which ruined my appetite. I was so looking forward to reading the pile high presentation of the nachos, what a let down.....one star because they have Cherry Pepsi.",
        "Going into it, I did have high expectations based on the ratings and reviews I had seen.  My husband and I got cookie dough and cookies & cream.  We both left completely unimpressed with at taste of sour milk in our mouth.  Maybe we just got a bad batch?  I don't think we will be going back again anytime soon.",
        "Awesome place. Large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear. Pretty good deals that I liked. Bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable. You can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you. Very friendly and professional place.",
        "I'm very excited to try e2 again in the very near future.\\n\\nWe attended a Yelp event at e2 this week and were able to sample some what what they have to offer.  Everything served was fantastic and as I saw food strolling by to lucky hungry tables, I grew even more excited to try more.  This may very well be worth one of the rare 5 star grades and I will update this post as soon as we try it again!",
        "The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!",
        "What a great dinner!  I had the pasta trio special.  They walk around with three pastas and just re-fill your plate.  I even wanted one of them without an ingredient,and they didn't bat an eye.  They even had the pasta prepared the same way to refill me!  I haven't been back, and I kick myself for it on my way out of town every time I visit there!",
        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "We were a party of six and ordered 9 items altogether And the food was good. But it took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. One hour before our main dishes appeared. We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd.",
        "Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)",
        "I'm here at least every other week for a gel manicure and often for a pedicure too.  Sarah H and I often come together because a pedicure is more fun with a friend.  The salon is clean and well organized and beautifully designed.  The nail techs are always friendly and very accommodating.  I've been coming here almost exclusively for the last two years and I'm happy I discovered it,",
        "Not pleased. Bad service, generic noodles and broth, and steep prices for pho. I waited to be seated at 2p on a Monday, then waited to order, and waited for a water refill despite empty tables throughout. I also asked for fried tofu but received steamed. Pass.",
        "This place is a gem for a local food lover... The plate lunches are awesome and the won ton min is huge!  The hotel it's located in is a dive but this is worth visiting.",
        "Wow, looks like everyone had the same experience I did.  Over priced bland food, no chips (unless you pay extra I guess), $2 for a tiny thing of guacamole.  Food was cold when it arrived and there were only about four tables - and it was during the afternoon.  Don't go here, it's a waste of money.",
        "I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias.\\n\\nIn the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",
        "Reviews are pretty much right on. Stiff drinks, good prices for happy hour. Appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips, served on Plastic plates. On par with what Dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint.",
        "Expensive. They Don't have the red bull sugar gumming bear.\\n\\nOnly cool thing is location.  One of places I stay when I go vegas.",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "This is your typical Lebanese place that specializes in Shish Taouk, Shwarma among others.  It has a good number of tables for eating there with a outdoor patio for the warmer months.  Service is fast and to the point, exactly what you want at a fast food joint.  If you go for lunch expect a crowd.",
        "Returned for another dinner with friends last night... \\nWhile the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.\\n\\nI don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!",
        "Great spot in Charlotte!! I live in LA but am in Charlotte about 3 times per year and this is the best thing you guys have going!! I have had robata at Katana on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and at Wolgang Puck's Robata restaurant in Vegas but this place tops them both! Very delicious and creative menu!! I will make Baku a regular stop when I come back to town!",
        "Take out Pizza with out the grease! The pizza's from La Favourita are amazing - fact! MY favorita is the Capricciosa with extra anchovies followed by the Tiramisu. We had them last night after an afternoon of gardening which works up an appetite and a half I can tell you. Two large pizzas, between three and we were happy garden gnomes sat in the sun with a bottle of red. Lovely",
        "We went on a Friday for dinner and everything was excellent? The server recommended 3 plates each. We decided to split three which was a wise choice as they were huge! Great service and atmosphere we will definitely be back.",
        "You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking.",
        "This was surprisingly good!  We were just looking for a casual lunch, and went in with low expectations.  But, the food was quite good, and the service did a nice job.\\n\\nI'm not going to seek it out again, but if I'm standing next to the place, and I'm hungry.. sure.",
        "Clearco is a Internet-based world class ripoff.  We have a one story house. They quoted $270 for inside and out which we agreed to pay even though it was higher than other services we used. Two high school kids came out. Their bill added $135.00 more for a \\\"tall ladder.\\\"  We asked them to wash the two mirrors in the house. They refused.",
        "While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!",
        "We love RPC!! We have been here for nine years and just love Pastor Bill's sermons and the worship here! Our son loves the Children's ministry and we are so happy to be a part of the RPC community!",
        "Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars",
        "The most outstanding customer service and extremely efficient wash, details, and oil changes! Anything and everything I need exceeds more than my expectations. I go to this wash at least two times a week and I leave happy every time!",
        "I just want to give a HUGE thank you!!!! This place by far exceeded my expectations!!!! You guys are all so great and you truly do stay true to your words. I will definitely be coming here from now on. \\nHands down the best place to go",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!",
        "Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",
        "Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.",
        "Great place with a personal touch! The owners always remember my name- and the food is very good as well. I've only had their breakfast, and need to try lunch here.  It is a very clean and well-maintained place to go, and the prices are reasonable. The Esplanade needed other alternatives to Starbucks and this restaurant really fits the bill. Recommended!",
        "Couldn't have had a better experience  the place was clean from top to bottom  . I was greeted immediately smiles all around . I was served fast   . Food was hot and fresh   drinks weren't watered down  tables were clean and staff didn't seem to have down time   , they were busy cleaning  and sweeping    highly recommended",
        "Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Finally found a great Vegas hotel that suits our family need - It's very spacious, comfortable, nice Jacuzzi, great indoor/outdoor pool, non-smoking, and Quiet at night. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of some casinos, but it provided true comfort and luxury. If I have to complain about something, their food selection is very limited. We go out to stripe for food.",
        "This is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. It is probably five stars during the slowest hours. I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends.  The laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited. They do have change machines that work well.",
        "Good beer. Good pretzels with bier cheese. Good environment. All in all, a good place for some German grub and drinks. \\n\\nOn the other hand, this place definitely attracts the rowdier crowd. With it's long, shared tables, raucous clientele, and live music on the weekends it's not an environment for the faint of heart.",
        "JULY 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu. The decor is ok. Overall this place is alright the food is not really that great. I would plan not to go to this restaraunt",
        "my roomie and i have been trying out all the east blvd. restaurants since we moved in the neighborhood about 2 months ago. this place is my least favorite so far. the service took forever- it was about 10 minutes before we even got our drinks. the food was just meh. our waiter was not very attentive. with all the other great options on the block, i doubt we'll be going back anytime soon.",
        "This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\\n\\nI've always had good service here.",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.",
        "Awesome burgers!! Delicious and made to order. Drinks are on point. Cute bar ambiance with friendly customer service and managers greeted me with a smile. For a bar, it will exceed expectations and the beer and burgers won't disappoint you.",
        "We come here quite often on saturday mornings. The food is good and the servers are always friendly and fast. My only real complaint is there is always 10 families/couples waiting for a table and there are 20 open tables..... its the weekend,  plan on having a few more servers working so customers don't have to wait.",
        "Just off the strip, and miles away from \\\"the strip\\\".\\nIf you want real food, real people and real Vegas spend and evening at Carluccio's.  The food is delicious, the portions are generious and the service is warm and comfortable.  Don't waste your time walking through another casino to get some half warmed over chain style \\\"italian\\\".  \\nOh, and the price!?! PERFECT.",
        "I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes."

        "Horrible service. No one had any idea what was going on. Overpriced. Everything took FOREVER to come out. Will definitely not return.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "Just 2wks in training with Angela and I'm already noticing weight change and definition! Haven't set foot in a gym over 7yrs and I'm in love with the training! Angela helps push me and keeps me motivated and focused! This is definitely a lifestyle I want to keep!!! Thank you Angela!!!",
        "When I was kid, we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis. They have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly. \\n\\nThe hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable, its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience.",
        "Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",
        "Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!",
        "I was here for about 10 minutes bc we were roaming through all the Palms clubs/bars and I really liked it. The place is definitely tiny compared to the other clubs around but the music was good and I loved the huge booth seating. Also, their patio is pretty big and the view is nice. I'd definitely come back here to start off the night.",
        "The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location",
        "Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon.",
        "This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd.",
        "I tried a slice of lemon cake; it tasted very artificial...kind of pinesol-ish. Definitely not homemade. I also tried a few cookies that were OK, nothing to get too excited about.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "So apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough",
        "My husband said it very accurately: \\\"its a once in a lifetime experience.\\\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.  It seems to me that the sandwiches are not anything great once you look past its size.  I ate it with the fries and cole slaw, but I could have done without the fries.  It is just a filler.\\nThe atmosphere as fun and very casual.",
        "JULY 29, 2011 == noticed  the restaurant's  sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here!",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\\n\\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \\n\\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training.",
        "A buffet of average. Everything is okay, nothing is bad, but for bellagio you'd expect a little more. It's not expensive relative to other buffets but it's not cheap either. They seem to have conceded to being average, and they shouldn't have.",
        "I love this restaurant! The portions are generous, and the food is flavorful and filling. The service was awesome and they were definitely attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe wait time for the food was not long at all, but to keep us entertained, they have books and games at the tables to pass the time. Such a fun idea.\\n\\nI highly recommend the fish and chips or the blue cheese bacon burger!",
        "You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else.",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "Nice bar! We came here for beers but there are games and good looking food. We would definitely come here again. Good music too!!",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles.",
        "The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \\\"OK\\\" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude.",
        "Perfect day for target practice with the pistol. Sure beats an indoor range when the weather is cooperating. Today it was perfect barely even a breeze. Friendly staffers very cheap and you can buy ammo there if you don't have your own. Its a bit  of a drive unless you live in Aliante but definitely worth it!",
        "This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \\\"No Meat March,\\\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "This place is absolutely amazing! The ambience is trendy and and relaxing. The food was delicious. I had the carnitas. The meat was so tender and served on the bone. The margaritas here are out of this world. They claim their margaritas are the best in the world and I haven't had one better. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!!",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\\n\\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different.",
        "Walked around for a while and found Jason's deli.  Place was clean and I tried their reuben sandwich today.  I give the Reuben 4 stars for taste.",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.",
        "Great place! Everyone was so nice!! My 2 yr old is usually a nightmare in the chair. But after a rough few minutes (and a different movie) he was great. It was like a miracle. And his haircut is adorable. They did a great job. Would definitely recommend it.",
        "The service takes forever... But they are nice... Obviously you must get the Frozen Hot Chocolate... Get it girrrrrrrrrrl",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.",
        "went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",
        "Pretty expensive and not terribly original.  I didn't really see a clear theme, other than obviously Beatles music.  As usual talented performers.  But in my opinion not worth the ticket price.  If you really want to go then try half price ticket provider.  I would vote for the Absinthe show if you are up for raunchy.",
        "Despite being located in the Eureka, the food is really good! The pork belly buns are so delicious. The rice dishes we had were ok, but would definitely go back just for those buns.",
        "Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.",
        "Service was incredible.  We were a group of seven and all were pleased with the food and service provided.  We would all definitely recommend and return.",
        "Stopped in for some Gelato for my nephew since it was so hot out. I understand this stuff melts, but why did it seem like it was melting before she scooped it? the gelato did not look appetizing one bit.",
        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "The NY-NY is a solid casino / hotel. The rooms are usually moderately priced and can be quite nice. There is a decent selection of casual and fine dining. And there are some great bars. The spa, salon, and pool, however, definitely leave something to be desired. And I can't say that I'm much of a fan of the latest makeover. But, all in all, it's a good place to stay and play.",
        "They were really nice and welcoming here at the Gelato Bar.  The staff lets you try  anything flavor you want.  There is fruit flavored gelatos to coffee and vanilla.  The coffee and vanilla were my favorites.  I would definitely go back here again.  I love this place.",
        "Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back.",
        "Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area.",
        "Geez, just because I wasn't dressed in a suit after my long drive into town doesn't mean you should ignore me and pretend I don't even exist. Shoot, even a \\\"hello, good afternoon\\\" goes a long way. I would know, because I work retail. So stop being snobbish a-holes and acknowledge your clientele, you stuck-up blue blood douchebags. Your store definitely lost a sale that day.",
        "Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care.",
        "Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza. Pizza was just okay. I've had better pizza from chain delivery franchises.  My friends were disappointed and apologetic. Obviously, I won't be back, but neither will they.",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.",
        "My wife and I came here several years ago and loved the place.  We decided to stop by again and what a mistake it was.  The food selection was very limited.  The taste was ok.  I was anticipating to have lobster tail but apparently they did away with it.  We were disappointed.   One good thing, there was no line.  We were seated immediately on a Saturday night for dinner.",
        "I think Korina might have mixed this place up with somewhere else - or perhaps has an ex-boyfriend working there... \\n\\nCommunity Tire is one of the most professional companies I have ever done business with, and they definitely stand behind their work 100%.\\n\\nI have used two of the Community Tire locations and had nothing but perfect results. Fast, fair, friendly! Plus, they give back a lot to the local community.",
        "Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!",
        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "Im not the biggest fan of this store.  The diapers and everyday items seem to be a lot more expensive here.   We did buy some bigger ticket items like a car seat, and a few other things.  Some of the kids seats and bean bags they have were very dirty and almost looked used while they kept their overpriced new price on them.   It seems hit or miss if you get an employee that is happy to be there or not.  Not a big fan of this store",
        "Friendly but just can't seem to get my hair right.... After several times trying to tell them how I wanted it... Seems like it's just cut how they want... Oh well I give up! Luckily hair grows :) best of luck to you all",
        "Since the Keg had an hour wait and I was with 2 grown men who were hungry, we came to Vieux-Port instead. Our waiter was too proud to be serving us, I really don't know how to say it, he never looked us while taking our order and was annoyed that we were even there! My salmon was well cooked, but extremely blend, my fiance's steak was apparently perfectly cooked.",
        "The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings.",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!",
        "Pretty good but nothing special. Definitely better than IHOP or Denny's, though. Have a few interesting omelettes and scrambles but nothign to really write home about. Would go again if I'm in the area and looking for breakfast but not making a special trip.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "The chips are fresh, so is the salsa, the food was just okay,  nothing that I would run back to! But the shrimp ceviche and the margaritas definitely would have me running back only during happy hour!\\nThe service was A1, everyone was very nice and friendly, especially my waiter Claudio!",
        "People seem to really like Sam's, though I am not quite sure why.  I think it is average.  Not great, not bad, just middle of the road food with a Southwestern twist.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes good, but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat.",
        "Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here.",
        "One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.",
        "Overall, a great deal! It is a small buffet, and obviously some things are better than others. But there is a good selection, and the Philly cheesesteak station was awesome! Great variety on the salad bar. You can make your own sandwich. Plenty of hot dish options, with a lot of variety. Quite a few dessert selections to choose from as well, including sugar-free options. Sunday evening dinner was only $9.18, you can't beat that!",
        "The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.",
        "There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "I tried going here earlier today with my mom and sister and it turns out that it's closed!  We read the notice posted at the window that said that it was \\\"temporarily closed for remodeling\\\".  I sent a message to a moderator about the closure so hopefully it'll be updated soon.",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "This place has a French name, but a Csoul. It has a good selection of Chinese buns and pastries. For 1$, the chicken bun I had was warm and tasted as well as I expected.\\n\\nThey offer a large selection of teas and bubble teas that are as good as most places around.\\n\\nThe service is a bit below average and sometimes the place does not seem as clean as it could be.",
        "They make you line up a mile long and wait till 1130 to let people in. \\nDoormen are assholes",
        "I LOVE this restaurant!  GREAT hummus selections.  Fun staff.  Very reasonable prices.  You'll definitely get enough to eat!  There's cool are inside and lots of great seating outside.  I love that everything is SO healthy and that it's like a little hippy haven in the middle of posh Scottsdale.  Location is great!  It's a great place for lunch or dinner, especially if you want to eat before hitting up Harkins!\\n\\nEAT HERE!",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "The slowest drive thru I have ever experienced. I got in line at 11:20, it's now 11:50 and I haven't even made it to the speaker to take my order. Only 6 cars ahead of me! Ridiculous. People seem friendly but are either short staffed or not very good at their jobs.",
        "Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it",
        "I love their pizzas\\nAnd now they have pastas, and they're awesome too!\\n\\nI still prefer Postino's bruschetta... but I can't seem to put my finger on why.  I think it might be the bread....",
        "What an amazing spot! They've got a huge beer selection with some on draft and most in bottles. Where else can you get live music with cheap beer? It is an old converted house and is hard to find. Supposedly they do that on purpose because they don't want to be flooded with people. That really makes no sense since it isn't on a busy street. However, this is probably one of the better spots I've been to in the Phoenix Metro Area.",
        "I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again.",
        "I'm not sure what I love more - the food or the ambiance. Jean Phillipe is such a fun place to visit just to look around; they even boast the world's largest chocolate fountain. My favorite thing to eat is the banana foster crepe.  \\n\\nTrying to find seating in the cafe is nearly impossible so just grab your food, make a left and grab a seat near the window overlooking the pool area.",
        "Have not been at night but based off a traditional coffee shop, it's not conducive to studying. Food items seem interesting although I have not tried any.",
        "Needed a place to practice hitting. Otherwise I'd have found another place. Not enough room in the slow pitch cage to allow for a full swing. Thankful I had someone with me to pull the net away. Definitely not worth $25 for an hour of pitches. Two stars only because it's indoors."

I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.

        "Amazing!!! I tried their Nutella-banana-nut crepe at the Old Town Farmers Market in Scottsdale, AZ and it was simply the best Nutella Crepe I've ever had. Keep it up!",
        "I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",
        "Dr. Griffith is great. I've been to other vets who don't even care about animals. She is great with them. My large dog was feeling defensive and she knew how to make her feel comfortable and was patient during the whole visit. This will be the new place we take our dogs, and the fact that it's the cheapest in town is the cherry on top. Quick in and quick out too. No long waits. I'm happy!",
        "Dr. Cruz is a very good physician.  She actually touches you and listens to what you are telling her and tries to get you to the right diagnostic testing or specialist.  I have enjoyed having her as my physician and my family's physician.  The office is clean and the staff is usually pretty professional and attentive.  Not sure if she is returning to the practice so I had to find another primary care physician but would prefer to see Dr. Cruz again.",
        "Closest I've found to NJ/NY bagels in Charlotte area.. Bagels are pretty great, had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious.  A little neater (fluffy scrambled egg) and less greasy than a true Brooklyn bagel,but that's really not a complaint and I guess that's the Charlotte touch .",
        "Very good dental office.  Longtime staff.  A good sign.  Front desk friendly.\\n\\nMost services available.\\n\\nDr Crowley personable and sensitive to patient.  No pain.  Anxiety management very good.\\n\\nExcellent hygienists.\\n\\nI personally have been a patient five years.",
        "Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.",
        "I LOVE this hotel and the staff! When I come back to the Phoenix area, I will stay at the Hyatt Place again and again They have shuttle and will take you to Casino Arizona or to Main and Sycamore light rail and bus stop. \\nI'm NOT a big fan of their breakfast!!",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "Great place to stop in and have a drink as well as some appetizers. I personally just finished eating when we got to Typhoon, so I didn't get a chance to try their food. \\n\\nThe decor is lounge oriented and modern.  Service was excellent with very nice looking ladies that we're smiling the whole time serving drinks. \\n\\nI would recommend if your close to downtown Montreal.",
        "Oh this place is good!\\nTheir portions are more than enough, and everything tastes so home made!\\n\\nIts open late! Im not sure how late, but its open late, and this is my go to place after I get out of class and want to grab some good asian cuisine.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",
        "Without hesitation, the food in good! But personally waiting up an hour is not good for me. If there's a way you can improve, that would be perfect! But I still come here when not in a hurry. :)",
        "Good flavor, good service, long wait and under done pepperonis. Gotta go to Grimaldis in Brooklyn to compare the two. Nothing special.",
        "Rick takes care of the carpet and tile in my home in Scottsdale. He is highly professional, well spoken, and does a great job. He's someone I can trust in my house, got my carpets and tile very clean, and spent lots of time and never rushed. He explained things to me and did an amazing job overall. It was a great experience from making my appointment to payment. Thank you!",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.",
        "Red Rock Harley Davidson is the best motorcycle dealership I have ever visited.  If you want to buy a Harley-Davidson, new or used, see Jack V.  He is an outstanding, no pressure sales person.  If you need your motorcycle serviced, see Matt F.  He is knowledgeable and very informative.  \\n\\nIf I were in the market for another bike or when I need mine serviced, I will only go to Red Rock Harley Davidson.",
        "On paper, happy hour sounds great. In reality, it sucked for us. Drinks were very pricey and the food was okay, even at 50% off. However our bartender was very rude and snarky. She had a rather bitchy attitude. Go to Brooklyn Bowl for better food and drink prices.",
        "i am not sure why there would be any review higher than 1.  ppl giving this place a good review must not had a decent buffet before.  everything we had was super salty.  the prime rib was raw, and all the fruits there are from cans.  the only things that were ok were the shrimp cocktails and the salad.  my friend had stomach sickness the same night after dining here.",
        "I have never had a better doughnut. They are like a drug you just gotta keep going back for more!",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",
        "Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\\n\\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\\n\\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall.",
        "This theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise it's never busy. I've been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when I've gone, I have received great service. I personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors.",
        "I admit my spouse is a bigger fan, but the food is fresh and authentic in style. We go often as the lighter fare is a nice break from traditional american cuisine.\\n\\nThey regularly have coupons in the val packs which arrive in the mail monthly making a full meal out hard to resist.",
        "If you are looking for a wonderful way to \\\"board\\\" your pet while you are away, I highly recommend Doolittle's Doghouse!  Your pet will stay in the home of a carefully selected \\\"nannie\\\" who will provide loving care while you are gone.  (No more cages and dog runs!)  As a veterinarian, I make recommendations very carefully and I highly recommend this service to my friends, family and clients!",
        "Food was good.  Very reasonable but the real treat is katie who epitomizes what it means to be a great tender of the bar!  Super friendly, very attentive and very easy on the eyes.  I sat at the bar and watched Monday Night Football and enjoyed everything.",
        "Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs, air filters, and other automotive bits.  They also offer a huge selection of housewares and hardware.  Also, this place is CHEAP.  \\n\\nOne other thing: if you're a student going to a barn dance, Farm and Fleet is your one stop shop for flannel shirts, farm boots, and enormous belt buckles.",
        "The food was mediocre compared to the Taiwanese type food I have at home. Mostly the same dishes but different flavor... I will not come back here.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "I really had a good stay at this hotel. They staff was extraordinarily friendly. They offered me water upon arrival, which was very appreciated. The room was clean and spacious. I was supposed to be there for 6 days, though l left earlier than planned. On the 3rd day, they left me some milk and cookies in my room.  Very nice! the breakfast was pretty good.",
        "This review is for the Sunday Market on Eastern.\\nVery limited selection at very high prices. Mostly the left overs from the first 2 days.\\nThought I would try it again but it was just the same.\\nYou can save 50% by shopping at the District at Green Valley's farmers market\\non Thursday evening.",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "One of the best Hyatt Place hotels I've stayed at. Clean, comfortable and friendly, accommodating staff. They even have a putting green (that I didn't get to use)! Centrally located near the Bass Outdoor Superstore & Mall, near the 202 and 101 freeways. However, they could maybe upgrade their breakfast service a bit. Will come back, excellent value.",
        "Probably my favorite Apple Store besides the one at San Tan Village. Everyone at this location has always been helpful. I've purchased two laptops here and was always offered advice and suggestions for what I was planning on using them for. Only complaint is about the repair prices which seem extremely high in comparison to some third party retailers.",
        "Most delicious toffee ever tasted. The variety of flavors to choose from  Is made to perfection which  certainly satisfies the sweet tooth. I first discovered the toffee at the Bruce Trent Farmers Market.  I also like the fact I  buy online to share with family and friends for those special occasions.  :)",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",
        "I can't believe I'm rating the Las Vegas location higher than the original Brooklyn one, but then again I'm all about good customer service. The pizza here was very nearly as delicious as it was in New York, the waiter who served it was quick and genial, and the restaurant itself was clean (though a bit kitschy in all its obvious New York decor). I would definitely come back during another Vegas trip.",
        "This lady is anything but professional she talks like crazy even of her personal life with her assistants. I call 24 hr before my appointment to cancel  and she wanted to charge me 100$. Then I still went to her office and she didn't even do what it was suppose to be done. Personally I DON'T RECOMMEND HER!!!!",
        "Awesome, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Great service and $1 beers, what could be better.",
        "We purchase our puppies' 5-in-1 vaccines here...bonus, the coupon we found in the mail also applies to vaccines which add up if you are doing the whole series yourself...\\n\\nAlso the various Pet Clubs have vet clinics for for rabies and micrchipping at dif times of the month at extremely affordable pricing.",
        "Very friendly staff and the store is usually very clean. I have seen quite an improvement in this store over the past 4 years. However, the selection of organic fruits/ vegetables is pretty small and very expensive. I don't like the fact that I go to a huge grocery store yet cannot get what I need in that one stop. I hope this store will expand their selection of organic options soon.",
        "My cousin and her fiance had their engagement party here on the Patio which connects to the lake and park. Never having eaten here before I don't know if I got the best impression from the pre-prepared catered food. We were served their sliders, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and cheese and crackers. Nothing that could really make an impression! I thought the restaurant looked nice enough, but everything came off as a little bland.",
        "We took our one year old dog, Owen, in for neutering.  The staff was wonderful!  The surgery went so well- very impressive.  I would highly recommend this vet- we have been in the area for over 25 years- tried many vets and this is the best without overcharging you.",
        "This store does have almost everything for babies. However, prices are higher than Target or other retailers. Additionally, customer service is non existent at this location (rainbow). Expect to pay more and be patient waiting in long lines.",
        "Dr Glassman has been a caring and thorough physician. He takes the time to make you feel at ease and important and he always explains everything so I can understand it. His staff is friendly and kind and they always remember my name and make me feel wwlcome. Highly recommend this Doctor to anyone!",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "This is one of my favourite Indian restaurants in Arizona . Very good food, very good service. Their Goat curry is so very yummy and the staff is always so friendly. If you are unfamilar with Indian cuisine then would recommend going to the lunch buffet to sample a variety of dishes. The prices are also reasonable.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Tons of Wells Fargos in the area but this is the only one open on Sundays (11-5) and open late till 7pm mon-sat. These are the Vegas conveniences I really missed when I moved.  \\n\\n It's a small, but full service branch nside an albertsons. Pretty long lines on a Sunday, but my teller was quick, friendly and super helpful",
        "I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.",
        "Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.",
        "Vraiment excellent! Cuisine raffin\\u00e9e,pr\\u00e9sentation soign\\u00e9e et tr\\u00e8s diff\\u00e9rent de ce qu'on peut manger ailleurs comme tapas. \\u00c0 essayer et adopter!",
        "Tried their half soup and salad. Soup was a very hearty chili and beans . This was more like a bowl than a cup. The soup was like a stew. Tried their salad with fruits apples and pears . Interesting blend",
        "I found the show to be extremely entertaining and funny as hell.  A great interaction with the crowd and hilarious impersonations.   The finale was my favorite.   I loved that he met with everyone after the show and thanked them personally for coming out.   If you're in Vegas go check this show out!",
        "Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!",
        "A cool little walkway between the Flamingo and the Quad that has food, shopping places to sit and relax , and a few watering holes, not to mention a huge observation wheel that is soon to be open. I like this concept and it will be a great new place to take out of towers as well a a place to frequent as a local. I am excited to go to the Brooklyn Bowl. Bowling, drinks, food and concerts all at one venue. This place looks legit.",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "This restaurant has very authentic Taiwanese food and reminds me of my grandma's cooking. I am never disappointed by the quality of the hand-made noodles and sauces that come along with all of the variation. One thing I have noticed over the numerous times I've been there is that their soup dumplings have become smaller and smaller in size. The flavor of the soup dumplings is very similar to my favorite soup dumpling restaurant in Asia so I highly recommend this place!",
        "We haven seen a number of shows in both Reynolds Hall and more intimate Cabaret Jazz.  The buildings and grounds are beautiful and represent a cultural gem for the city  and its residents.  We invariably see at least one show each trip and have never been disappointed.  On our most recent visit we saw the Wizard of Song which previously played off Broadway for 1.5 years and starred local George Bugati.",
        "Authentic CLEAN Spanish cuisine, good service.",
        "I don't typically like Asian cuisine but When I came here I had the shrimp pho, It was so delicious! If you like spicy and seafood, this is your dish. And service here is friendly and I love the decor, it's so cute.",
        "Above average buffet. My wife and I went for breakfast and had a few good things like egg cooking station and the wide selection of cultural cuisines like Chinese, continental, japanese etc. service was average with a smile. But the quality of food was average and tables were left quite dirty for a long time. Edible but don't take your mama there on mothers day. Maybe take a friend",
        "Dans cet amas de junk food, vous cherchez de la cuisine saine ? Vaguement europ\\u00e9enne ?\\n\\nGo there !!!",
        "16$ lunch excluding tax...well, basically u get what u pay for, simple as that...very simply made selection of stuff, nothing exotic...its all u can eat, so no problem there...watch out for the high amount of rice that easily makes ya full...personally given my exotic taste in food (ehem ehem), id say it sucks...but given what i pay for, its A-ok...",
        "We've eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food. The deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal! I love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice, it's my favorite! The selection and unique cuisine is top notch!",
        "Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...",
        "One of my favorite malls. Lots of fun stores, restaurants and activities.\\n\\nI gave 4 stars merely because this mall is hard to shop at during the summer and some of the major department stores and retailers are located far from the mall itself, so you have to drive and re-park a few times to hit all of your favorite stores. Otherwise, it's great!",
        "My wife and I decided to give this place a try and fell in love with the food. The food is fresh and has authentic flavors. The curries are outstanding, the best I think I have ever had, if you like Asian cuisine you are going to love this place.",
        "The atmosphere was great! The menu didn't have as many options as I would have liked. In Southern California Brunch is usually offered Sunday with bottomless mimosa's or champagne, omelette station and buffet style, but Chelsea's Kitchen is a brunch menu style restaurant strictly menu and on Saturday's they offer bottomless Mimosa's. I will have to try it again.",
        "Absolutely love this place. A locally owned pizza place that has been here for years. I love the nuclear fries with ranch dressing. Speaking of ranch dressing they make it themselves and sell it by the bottle. I personally like the pizza cut in squares. By far the best pizza in town!",
        "Wow, this antique mall seems to go on and on forever. It is huge and has a wonderful selection of collectibles. I am in the market for collectible books and they had so many books, that I could not see them all in this trip. There are a lot of kitchen items, dishes and vintage toys. This is a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon. The prices were reasonable. There was a check in offer and some of the dealers booths have coupons.",
        "Good nice grocery  store with regular and organic food items. I enjoy getting the basics like milk yogurt fresh fruits when in season and some other items that may look good that I may wanna try. Always good to try.",
        "When is Land Rover fast? When they're processing my payment. When do they take their sweet time? The remainder of the time. BTW, that free coffee is gonna cost you.",
        "Great variety of flavors!  It's got a clean, modern feel and plenty of room.  There's a half decent choice of toppings, though I personally prefer a broader selection.  I love the \\\"menu\\\" on the wall to suggest ways to mix and match flavors and toppings to make yummy treats!  We'll probably return since the location is close and the yogurt flavors were really tasty!",
        "I have never stayed at a Hyatt Place hotel before, but I will make it a regular chain from now on. on this same trip I stayed at the Hyatt Place in Nashville and both hotels were what every hotel should be. great customer service,  clean room, and a great overall experience!",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding.",
        "I love this farmer's market because they carry Crow's Dairy Goat Cheese.  You seriously need to try this cheese.  The pepper goat cheese is amazing!  \\n\\nThe store is small, but has a decent selection.  I'm really just there for the cheese.  :-)",
        "do not deal with the salesman orlando. the other sales reps warned me about him. he is a liar and his sales commission goes towards his wifes drug addiction. we regret our decision to deal with that piece of shit",
        "Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!",
        "Great place with even better staff. They're very helpful, patient and caring. There have never been any surprise bills and they're very gentle with the animals. I only see Dr. Whitcraft because she is so personable, kind and terrific at her job. I highly recommend this place, especially compared to other vets I've been to throughout the years.",
        "Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market.",
        "This review is strictly for the lounge/bar area.  I loved the ambiance and decor here, with the balcony overlooking the casino and the changing color lights.  Super soft leather seating and of course pricy ass drinks.  But boogey enough that I was impressed since this was indeed Vegas!",
        "A Master Chef and food historian brought me to Joe's Diner. I've been coming back ever since. The decor is classic American diner but the food and coffee is a cut above. $10 sandwiches are done perfectly. The coffee is Arbuckles Ariosa cowboy coffee. The waitress was very nice. Nice little mid town jem in the Melrose District",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "I give this a five star only because for what it is, it's BANGIN. I got so,etching called the farmers meal, or something like that. It was MASSIVE. When you order a pancake here they give you one the size of three, and it's actually delicious. They have wonderful crispy home fries. It was just a great and filling meal. So I give it a five star. They cooked one hell of a breakfast.",
        "Man, I went there today and wow!  I personally loved this place...it reminded me of a few cafes back home in Dallas, Tx.  If you're looking for a good breakfast place...go to this place!!!  You won't regret it!!!  :)"

        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.",
        "Meh. It was fine, but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken. But they ignored the mistake as if it's how the dish comes out. Maybe I'm ignorant to Afghan style beef. Or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue. Either way they handled it terribly. And the service was lacking. Bleh.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...",
        "The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.",
        "Small local restaurant, but cheap price, good food, and lovely owner sing a song for you.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",

        "This place is absolutely amazing! The ambience is trendy and and relaxing. The food was delicious. I had the carnitas. The meat was so tender and served on the bone. The margaritas here are out of this world. They claim their margaritas are the best in the world and I haven't had one better. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!!",

        "I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.",

        "The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.",
        "A perfect day we will remember forever. Thank you Vicky and the rest of the staff at Vegas Weddings. I would recommend you anytime",
        "I struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars, really should be 1.5.  I agree with others regarding the rude/surly male employee.  I have the impression he is the owner or manager so I am not sure this will ever be addressed.  The salads are good, but value is poor.  Don't waste your time or money.",
        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.\\n\\nI went with the kitchen sink combo.  The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "Everything is so good!!\\n\\nEspecially, Kushi and beef tongues.\\n\\nI love this place.\\n\\nYou should come here!!!\\n\\n^o^",
        "This is our first time here over all the experience was amazing. The employee explain everything on the menu. The service was a first-class service every employee was attentive to every customer in the restaurant. Everything that we tried was amazing I really recommend you to try the pork bun and chicken drummies. Thank you Yusho",
        "Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick \\nEPIC FAIL!!!!!!",
        "A healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza! The dumplings are homemade and are very soft. I had the carrot + beef dumplings and they were quite delicious. The congee is fairly cheap at 2$ a bowl so whenever I have spare change, I stop by and grab one. Give the place a try!",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Vegas! I love the reuben, especially how it's packed with corned beef, light on the cheese, and kraut. The portions are big, and I never skip on ordering the Matzo ball soup. Nice, casual place to eat.",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "I thought the food here was pretty good - cheap too. It started as an Ethiopian restaurant but the server told me that some Somalis bought it. The atmosphere was fine and they have a sitting room - see photo. The service was fine and the bathrooms were clean. My date enjoyed her Vegan meal and I enjoyed my beef dish. We left thoroughly satisfied - the portions were adequate. I would come here again. Celebrate Diversity! Solid!",
        "The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.",
        "very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun.",
        "Lots of food for the money! They are fast and food good...our favorite it the beef chimi and asada fries! Both are huge! Staff is always friendly.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "No, no, no, no no!!!\\n\\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again",
        "We couldn't get a table at Emeril Lagasse's place. So, we ended up here it was in the same hotel. The Oysters on the Half Shell and Tuna Tataki and Tartare was okay but pricey. For my main dish I had the Crispy Duck Breast. Pretty good it was a good thing I stay up the whole night after that dinner.",
        "We frequent Antonio's on a regular basis, and they are hands down the best pizza-by-the-slice in town! \\n\\nThey make a variety of unique and creative pizzas- that are always served fresh. Spicy Beef Taco, Chicken Florentine, and Chicken, Bacon, Ranch- just to name a few. My go-to slice is the Chicken Quesadilla! Absolutely delish!",
        "Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain",
        "Needed a place to practice hitting. Otherwise I'd have found another place. Not enough room in the slow pitch cage to allow for a full swing. Thankful I had someone with me to pull the net away. Definitely not worth $25 for an hour of pitches. Two stars only because it's indoors.",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition.",
        "I just love the Mongolian beef, I order it every time I get take out.",
        "One of the best dive restaurants ever. The portions are generous and the quality is consistent.\\nThe corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient & friendly. Great value and worth the visit.",
        "Stopped in for a drink after a long bike ride.  Total dive bar, but patrons and staff were very friendly.  I didnt have a bike lock and the patrons/owner said i could just bring in the bike while I got smashed.  I must have spent about $20 after being there for 2-3 hours.  I think the beers are $2.  Its a cash only bar, but they have an ATM in the front.  I will definitely be heading there again soon.",
        "Review is only for the tacos they serve outside. They're $.99 each but they charge tax with it. I like their selection of meats like cow head and beef tongue and they've got like 5 salsas. But I found their meat to be really tough and lacking flavor. Definitely a taco stand you can skip.",
        "This is where I usually go when visiting downtown. The atmosphere is great. I think its what makes this place. Its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls. There is also a dance floor and dj in the back. Last time I got a pretty rude bartender though. Only negative thing I have to say.",
        "Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!",
        "We really wanted to like this place given the other reviews, but came away very disappointed. Service was slow, but they were busy so that wasn't a big deal. While the Crab puffs were great, the entries were just too sugary (both Mongolian beef and Vegetable Lo Mein). We have never tasted any Chinese food that sweet (other than something like Orange chicken). Maybe it was just an off night?",
        "Gone so far downhill, they should just close this location. Had probably the worst Carne Asada Burrito any place in Vegas has ever served!\\nShould have been suspicious when it was ready in like 90 seconds. They worst re-overheated Leather Beef Jerky that I have ever tried to chew!\\n\\nAVOID THIS PLACE!",
        "I ordered a beef and cheese sandwich, which was forgettable. It was beefy, but flavorless. Considering that I have spent time in the East Coast, this in no way resembles hot sandwiches out there. I also found it to be on the expensive side. Their sides look interesting, but will sample them only if I'm in the area, which is right off the Meadows Mall and the 95.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!",
        "I recently got into doing triathlons. Finding a good tri store I thought would be hard, but the staff at tribe has been helpful every time I come in. They are loaded with all the workout goodies, which I love... Though my wallet may not.\\nIf you are looking for any gear for swim, bike, or run this is a good spot!",
        "Windy City Beef N' Pizza is a lot of fun. The food is decent. I've never been to Chi-town, but it seems to represent it well. If I'm in the mood for a hot dog or slice of deep dish pizza I know where to go.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.",
        "Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!",
        "Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "Got moussaka. Instead of bechamel, they put american cheese on top...interesting, cheap and not a tasty choice. So much lamb on the menu, it's hard to avoid. Just because it has lamb in it, doesn't mean its Mediterranean. Friend had beef platter. Beef too dry, too well done. For this price, you could get a lot better. Would not recommend",
        "Couldn't be happier with my service and experience at this high end bike shop. I strolled in after hours in need of some gear for an early morning spin class. Steve, the owner, was on hand and took his time showing me around and offering me the best deals and some amazing discounts too! I'll definitely be back soon to purchase my next road bike.",
        "Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!",
        "went here for the first time & I have to say I was satisfied with their food. we ordered the chicken & beef bulgogi and grilled saury, they were all really delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars for the food & atmosphere alone, but I had to take one star off for slow service & some dishes on the menu are a bit over priced.",
        "Red Rock Harley Davidson is the best motorcycle dealership I have ever visited.  If you want to buy a Harley-Davidson, new or used, see Jack V.  He is an outstanding, no pressure sales person.  If you need your motorcycle serviced, see Matt F.  He is knowledgeable and very informative.  \\n\\nIf I were in the market for another bike or when I need mine serviced, I will only go to Red Rock Harley Davidson.",
        "Loved this place. My wife and I came here for my birthday week end. I got the hot stone therapy. It was great. I got pampered. Them stones started out blazing at first but after a while i got used to it. It is a little pricey but well worth it. I don't get pedicures all the time but the few I have had, this is the best.",
        "The corned beef hash comes from a can, and includes an extra side of hashbrowns.  Yes, that means hashbrowns served with hashbrowns.  Are these people dumb?",
        "I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,",
        "Great flavor in the Kansas City beef ribs, but unfortunately the inside was cold... Makes me wonder if they just reheat everything... Brisket was good and with the 3-4 different BBQ sauces you'll find a flavor that suits your tastes.",
        "I had lunch there yesterday.\\nThey have a very nice ambience and perfect service. The staff is great.\\nI wouldn't recommend the pineapple fried rice or the nasi goran because it had a funky taste. My pineapple fried rice came with a duck and Chinese sausage... Didn't taste fresh to me.\\nVery overpriced... Disappointing.",
        "I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.",
        "Bad feeling about foods and services. We came with 2 women, 3 men and 2 kids, the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us, the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad.",
        "New Carly's. No tuna. Menu change & Carly's removed the tuna. Sorry but as that was my fav sandwich, I won't be back. Bummer. Less options other than chicken & beef. New menu letdown. Boo. Dislike.",
        "I just found this place over the weekend and stopped in for lunch. This place is a New York style deli with all of the favorites; Pastrami, Corned Beef, Stuffed Cabbage Rolls, bagels, NY style cheese cake, egg creams, and the list goes on and on. This place is large for a deli, clean, great service, priced right, and generous portions. Try the bagel chips.",
        "I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.",
        "The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.",
        "Expectedly high priced drinks at this lobby bar in Cosmopolitan. I think one Moscow Mule was $16 with tax and tip included. I guess this bar is good for pre-partying or people watching. I just hate spending this much on drinks though?",
        "My husband and I love coming here for HH to download from the day. Postino's has great food, wine and atmosphere. We always sit at the bar and are very well taken care of by Patrick and Dan.  We stick to the bruschetta board but have tried the roast beef, turkey and chicken sandwiches and they are pretty tasty as well.  The salads are good also but I prefer a sandwich or board.",
        "Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and for the most part it was a good experience and good food. The service was good too. Waiter was very courteous and explained everything about themselves and the menu. We ordered the two cups of crab bisque which was good, oysters Rockefeller which I thought was ok, stone crab legs were good, crab cakes and lobster sole which was our main dishes were ok. Overall it was a good experience and service was good.",
        "Cafe Monte is an excellent brunch spot for those with discriminating taste buds and small appetites.  I arrived with excitement and left hungry.  I know they are going for a \\\"French\\\" feel...but it just isn't my place of choice.  I will say our waiter was  GORGEOUS  and the piano man kept me entertained...a no go in the future.",

        "Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste.",
        "Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned.",

        "I bought my Specialized mountain bike several years ago at Exhale. I took it in recently for some mechanical issues. They were knowledgable with integrity, especially since I'm mechanically challenged.  They explained what needed done with estimates that were fair and reasonable. They even expressed changes that will help me with my riding goals.  Thanks Exhale!!!",
        "Unfortunately not good!! Today's visit was the last visit. Just not impressed with how greasy the beef is. Other dishes are ok nothing impressive enough for the price charged. Well... I do like the custard so it might not be the last time.",
        "Great service and an awesome business. Used bikes without the head ache. 30 day warranty plus a trade in program. I bought two bikes from bicycle exchange and couldn't be happier.\\n\\nwho trys to buy a bike for $50 bucks and expects quality and a warranty?",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!",

        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "I've been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good. The Chicken Fried Rice (I always start with this on my 1st time in) was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables. I have moved on to Pepper Steak and Mongolian Beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty.",
        "This is a great pizza place. Perfect brick oven taste at a good price. The pies run you for about 12 bucks. If you've ever been to Grimaldi's before this place has a similar taste. Best pizza restaurant I've been to in Arizona yet."

I cannot accept whatever java dung I was served with my all you can eat pancakes.  I'm sorry America this is a deal breaker.  I was good with your diner food  but what was poured in my coffee cup tasted like a dry roasted turd.",

They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",

        "Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",

I love the chocolate fountain they displayed and this little gem was by far the best at our stay at the Bellagio. 2nd best is their breakfast buffet lol\\n\\nI also had coconut macaroons and madelines as gifts and the receivers said they were great as well!",
        "A buffet of average. Everything is okay, nothing is bad, but for bellagio you'd expect a little more. It's not expensive relative to other buffets but it's not cheap either. They seem to have conceded to being average, and they shouldn't have.",

I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.

Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice.

Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "Loving Ulta! I wish they offered more loyalty rewards.",
        "A decent sandwich for a decent price. Not the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  Everything is \\u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to get here JUST for a sandwich, but if you are nearby it probably won't disappoint",
        "I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "Amazing!!! I tried their Nutella-banana-nut crepe at the Old Town Farmers Market in Scottsdale, AZ and it was simply the best Nutella Crepe I've ever had. Keep it up!",
        "Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\\n\\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.",
        "I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great.",
        "Great Breakfast food...expecially the skillets.\\nConsistent style and portions...I really like the chicken, bacon, avocado skillet. However, I'm not a big fan of the coffee...i think it's quite bitter. but they have fresh squezzed O.J....and great whole grain pancakes.",
        "Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "Nothing says Oceans 12, we've finally made it, like watching the Bellagio fountains!\\n\\nPRO TIP OF THE DAY: Pay the fare to go to the top of the Paris tower to watch the show! Worth it.",
        "Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \\\"etiqueccy\\\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",
        "Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here.",
        "I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere.",
        "Maybe I'm too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of H street in San Diego... Nothing comes even remotely close to it. Overall food was ok; priced just right. I say try it you'll probably like it!",
        "Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\\n\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nGood portions.\\n\\nAffordable.",
        "Where I lost most of my money but this review is for the horrible service I was provided. Sure, the Jabbawockeez show wasn't bad and Britney Spears sat a couple rows behind my sister but this place is so grungy and needs to keep up with the architecture. Come see me at the Bellagio!",
        "Everything here is amazing. Their pizza is bomb, its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for. Their turkey lasagna is also my go to. Their flavored margerita's are also really good...... and i dont even like margaritas. that is all.",
        "If you have a gianormous tree to be trimmed, these are the guys to do it.  Friendly, low cost, and did a fantastic job.  I had a large palo verde and eucalyptus tree (2 stories high) to trim and they have the right knowledge and tools to get the job done.  They even picked up some extra debris in my yard!  Thanks H&S!",
        "Our first visit. Sat on the patio and after 10 long minutes had to flag a server. If not for a time crunch my guest and I would have left. Servers all appeared overwhelmed and less than friendly. Not acceptable for upscale Scottsdale establishment on a Friday night. Good management appears to be lacking and it's a shame as this location has all the ingredients to be 4-5 stars consistently.",
        "I LOVE this restaurant!  GREAT hummus selections.  Fun staff.  Very reasonable prices.  You'll definitely get enough to eat!  There's cool are inside and lots of great seating outside.  I love that everything is SO healthy and that it's like a little hippy haven in the middle of posh Scottsdale.  Location is great!  It's a great place for lunch or dinner, especially if you want to eat before hitting up Harkins!\\n\\nEAT HERE!",
        "They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!",
        "Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.",
        "Oh gosh... The wife had a cesar salad and can we get some romaine hearts that aren't ready for the trash? The place smelled like vomit and there is a reason we haven't been back in almost a year since before this visit. I'm done, time to clean up the place!",
        "I love their pizzas\\nAnd now they have pastas, and they're awesome too!\\n\\nI still prefer Postino's bruschetta... but I can't seem to put my finger on why.  I think it might be the bread....",
        "I'm not sure why they call themselves barcelona, not very authetic spanish cooking. but the tapas are good. they could have a bigger selection of tapas. service was excelant. check them out on half price night!!! And try the Sangrias, free samples are available...",
        "I fell in LOVE with this place so much that I went back the next day to try more food and cocktails!\\nI LOVE the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing!",
        "I really wanted to like this place. The ambiance is cool, the menu items looked appealing and the service was average. Unfortunately, our food was OK and I felt it was overpriced for what we got. The sangria we ordered was refreshing was only $20 for a pitcher. All in all, I probably wouldn't come back here unless it was for happy hour which I have been told is a good way to experience this restaurant.",
        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego.",
        "Not too far from vegas strip. The lunch special is a great deal! Best food I ate while in vegas! Get the chicken tikka masala over white rice!! So good :) also very nice staff.",
        "By far the BEST HAPPY HOUR in Scottsdale. I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks for training a couple months ago and came here a few times.  The people that work here have spunk! This place has a very laid back and fun atmosphere, gives you a break from the rest of Snobsdale. The happy hour food prices and drink prices are unbeatable. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good time and great prices.",
        "Very good foie gras and pork belly over rice.  Price is decent compares to San Francisco.  Great service located in a unique location.  Reservation yes.  Great cocktail and sake menu.  For sure not for kids.  I will come back .",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "This place is entertaining as hell.  It was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once, and the beer selection was massive.  Unfortunately I got so sick from the food that I had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss Cirque du Soliel.",
        "sushi is better presented than it tastes.\\n\\nif you want to mingle with douchebags and douchebaguettes, sit outside. yes, ed hardy is worn en masse out there.\\n\\nit's a good deal during happy hour tuesday or with a gift certificate from www.localdines.com. remember, you can use those gc's on sun. through thurs. ONLY!",
        "Have been going back and I love this place. More ppl should come out. Have had the pastrami burger, avocado burger and bacon cheeseburger. All very good and their wait time at the drive thru has shortened considerably. Make the drive or stop by. Way better than InAndOut.",
        "A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \\n\\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.",
        "Very fair.  Went with waiter's recs & shouldn't have. Joe's in Florida so much better.",
        "Cold food at 11:45 buffet. Will never go back.\\n\\nWatery as hell Tikka Masala and butter chicken.if you're used to the chandler location this one is nothing like it. Different recipes altogether.\\n\\nSkip this is you like Real Indian food.\\n\\nMight change my review if they actually invited me back for some HOT food. Im upset I did not leave.",
        "Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!",
        "Ehhhhhhh.\\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",
        "Rick takes care of the carpet and tile in my home in Scottsdale. He is highly professional, well spoken, and does a great job. He's someone I can trust in my house, got my carpets and tile very clean, and spent lots of time and never rushed. He explained things to me and did an amazing job overall. It was a great experience from making my appointment to payment. Thank you!",

        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",

Or when you are sweating balls in that nice, desert heat when August rolls around.",
        "I had a confirmed reservation but unfortunately made it (via Yelp) for Wednesday and had intended for Tuesday. When we walked in on Tuesday in March at 6pm there was only 1 table that was occupied by patrons (the place was empty) and the hostess was very rude...she said that she wasn't sure if she could accommodate the 4 of us. Screw her, we left and went to the Herb Box.",
        "Cute place in an authentic setting. The restaurant has Scottish charm. The food was clean and hearty. Had a halibut carpaccio which was amazing. The staff was friendly. Met the owner who was just great. Highly recommend.",
        "Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!",
        "Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!",
        "Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure.",
        "Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",

        "We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre.",
        "Pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below.  Pomo in Scottsdale is better and closer.  Probably won't go back. \\n\\nThe staff were not friendly and it wasn't even that busy - we went last night.  To much success has gone to there heads.",
        "Large airport... it's international after all, but my god it's a lot of walking. Needs more moving sidewalks ala Bellagio / Caesars / Luxor / MGM style. lol. \\n\\ncould also use a facelift, it's rather lackluster in appearance, inside and out. this IS Vegas, right??",

        "Pasta was good. wine was good. but I cant trust an ITALIAN restaurant that puts Herseys syrup on their tiramisu. Sorry.",
        "Food is decent but not the best in Charlotte. Went with friends on Saturday night and it was so noisy I could barely hear my friends talking to me ACROSS THE TABLE. The bar area was worse than the dining room. Lots of families go with their children.I suggest going during the week.  There are better Italian places in our fair city with a lot less noise and confusion. That being said the foodis OK.",
        "They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.",
        "Great spot to just hang with the crew. Not the normal uppity Scottsdale bar. Games are upstairs and lots of room. Food was okay. I got the nachos and the chips were very stale but my friend got the burger and it looked really good. Good atmosphere. It's or after work hangout, if we can get everyone together more often.  :)",
        "A Vegas MUST if it is your first time. Romantic and inspiring.. the jets shoot so high into the air, it is amazing! \\n\\nThere is a bar inside the Bellagio.. Fontaine that has a great terrace to view from and if you are wanting to fine dine with a view of them, it is Picasso!",

The fried okra was very old and soggy, with the coating all destroyed.\\nThe honey butter was good and so was the service.",

Don't waste your time walking through another casino to get some half warmed over chain style \\\"italian\\\".  \\nOh, and the price!?! PERFECT.",

While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer.\\n\\nI will give it a try for dinner. Let's hope this time it will be less disappointing.",
        "Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!",

        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here.

        "Large cake portions. Good selection of macaroons. But I thought the almond croissant was way too sweet. I love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and I couldn't even finish the small portion. The almond croissant from La Belle Terre was much much better.",
        "Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch.

His staff  is equally rude aswell.",
        "This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",
        "The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",

The service was awesome and they were definitely attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe wait time for the food was not long at all, but to keep us entertained, they have books and games at the tables to pass the time.

        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it.

        "Poor service, lack of cleanliness, and unbelievably bad food.. A one star is too high of a rating! No second chance deserved here - no way we will be back.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process. When their original diagnosis was wrong they went to option b and didn't charge me for the unneeded replacement. They usually very busy, but we'll worth any wait.",
        "I have been going to Bear Kneads for over a year and have worked with both Chris and Dave. They are professional and very knowledgable guys. \\n\\nI play sports and have gone to Bear Kneads for sports related injuries as well as for relaxation. Their skill level compared to other places in Charlotte is second to none, especially considering how reasonable their rates are!\\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend Bear Kneads!",
        "Great food , the salmon was to die for.\\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter",
        "Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \\\"is that all\\\". The first time she did it I said \\\"let me finish\\\" the second time I said \\\"I need to speak with a manager\\\" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house.",
        "Staff is knowledgable and friendly. They have a big space, and hold lots of comic related event, but also gaming events for RPG's and CCG's. I visited all the comic shops when I moved here from NYC looking for a new on to feed my comic addiction, and Samurai is the one that I choose as the most real.",

        "omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well, they haven't gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar.",
        "I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.",
        "The NY-NY is a solid casino / hotel. The rooms are usually moderately priced and can be quite nice. There is a decent selection of casual and fine dining. And there are some great bars. The spa, salon, and pool, however, definitely leave something to be desired. And I can't say that I'm much of a fan of the latest makeover. But, all in all, it's a good place to stay and play.",
        "I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "Not fresh and overpriced. Service lacking.",
        "I wanted to order a \\\"gourmet\\\" burger as their sign advertises. When I tried to order it medium-rare I was told medium-well or well only. Huh? Gourmet burgers and you won't even cook to temperature? If you don't trust how your meat is being handled I'm sure not going to.",
        "The food is ok, not mind blowing. It's basically just snack food not real meals. I'd call it a classier Mc Donald's. I purchased a \\\"refillable souvenir cup\\\" but I had to pay $1.00 each time I refilled it. Can you say false advertisement.",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",
        "Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also",
        "Im not the biggest fan of this store.  The diapers and everyday items seem to be a lot more expensive here.   We did buy some bigger ticket items like a car seat, and a few other things.  Some of the kids seats and bean bags they have were very dirty and almost looked used while they kept their overpriced new price on them.   It seems hit or miss if you get an employee that is happy to be there or not.  Not a big fan of this store",
        "Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \\n\\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P",
        "I typically don't go down to the strip but when I do I at least expect to get high quality food (even if it is overpriced).  I realize this place is just a coffee shop but I never expected they would serve a steak that had been tenderized with papaya enzymes.  seriously gross.  the crab cake was ok but the best part was the remoulade.  also had a chopped salad that wasn't bad but it was over dressed.",
        "The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything.\\nFor example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver.\\nIf I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!",
        "This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.",
        "Very knowledgable and professional. Unfortunate that their shutters are made in China. Would have liked to use them but couldn't overlook that.",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "Very good dental office.  Longtime staff.  A good sign.  Front desk friendly.\\n\\nMost services available.\\n\\nDr Crowley personable and sensitive to patient.  No pain.  Anxiety management very good.\\n\\nExcellent hygienists.\\n\\nI personally have been a patient five years.",
        "VERY OVER RATED!   SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend.  Charges for in room frig and internet.  Many other extra fees.  OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts.",
        "Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\\n\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nGood portions.\\n\\nAffordable.",
        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "Coffee is drinkable but the barista totally hate customers and don't know anything about making coffee. If you ask for cream when they are out, they say ok and then go back their conversation they've got going with the same old guy that hangs there all day. Used to live near here and the same baristas are always awful and I always swore to myself I'd go to Starbucks instead. Sad to say. \\nadpfeedback@adp.com",
        "Probably not the cleanest place in town, but not unbearably dirty either. The food, however, is great. The bacon cheeseburger I ordered was excellent. The \\\"regular\\\" order of fries was very generous and among the best fries I've ever had. \\n\\nAnd the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch.",
        "I actually end up spending more time here than I do at my actual apartment. I travel to Charlotte almost weekly for work, and the staff at this hotel is amazing. They are very personable, and extremely accommodating. This is nice to have, since I am rarely home.",
        "I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.",
        "Great food and good pricing. The sushi is great and I've never gotten fishy or old sushi here! Great for kids, just wish they had the children's chopsticks available. Good atmosphere and outside dining with lake view available.",
        "I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.",
        "Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back.",
        "Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working",
        "Do not even stay here. The worst treatment I have ever received. Unbelievable! The spa is terrible as is everything else. Honestly, the Wynn came highly recommended and it was the worst experience in a hotel ever. 10% of the people were nice and the other 90% were absolutely horrible and disgraceful. It does not even deserve 1 star.",
        "Awesome place. Large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear. Pretty good deals that I liked. Bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable. You can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you. Very friendly and professional place.",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "I'm not sure why they call themselves barcelona, not very authetic spanish cooking. but the tapas are good. they could have a bigger selection of tapas. service was excelant. check them out on half price night!!! And try the Sangrias, free samples are available...",
        "I really wanted to like this place. The ambiance is cool, the menu items looked appealing and the service was average. Unfortunately, our food was OK and I felt it was overpriced for what we got. The sangria we ordered was refreshing was only $20 for a pitcher. All in all, I probably wouldn't come back here unless it was for happy hour which I have been told is a good way to experience this restaurant.",
        "Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)",

        "By far the BEST HAPPY HOUR in Scottsdale. I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks for training a couple months ago and came here a few times.  The people that work here have spunk! This place has a very laid back and fun atmosphere, gives you a break from the rest of Snobsdale. The happy hour food prices and drink prices are unbeatable. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good time and great prices.",
        "This place kind of just fell into my lap while walking around our office building. This place has REALLY good food if you are into heavy, flavorful meals. My favorite to get here is the Jambalaya. SO GOOD. This location is a very small location, but worth standing in line for if you wanted to try it. It's constantly packed, so make sure you are okay with waiting for a spot.",
        "I went in one day for a Orange Julius and the machine was not working. A week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available. A number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system. I could not identify a supervisor/manager on duty during either visit.",
        "Checked in and 2 hours later checked out.  There was no working wifi service in my room, nobody answering the switchboard, no replies from management, nobody available to help me out. Its a shame when management is so poor that a guest leaves feeling this way.",
        "I don't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines. Two weeks was what I was informed that it would take to fix my unit. I followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they haven't even started working on it.",
        "Really, really heavy food.  I like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals.  An experience, undoubtably, but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals.  A salad on the menu would be nice.\\n\\nThat said, the service was spectacularly good.",
        "Dr. Weiner is awesome! He put me at ease about my surgery and now I'm able to breathe through my nose. He is very knowledgable and explained everything in terms I could follow. The office staff at this location  on the other hand is not very friendly. They were as helpful as people at the DMV! I would suggest going to one if the other locations!",

They were short handed due to unexpected departure of an employee and went out of their way to make sure the customers left happy.  Food was fresh and delicious, love that grilled pita.  Will be going back again soon!",
        "This is a good Gap outlet at times.  Normally, we come out of this store empty-handed because the prices were too high.  The last couple of times, though, we have found some good bargains in there clearance section.\\n\\nThe store is clean and organized.  The employees are okay.",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all.",
        "Pros: Very fun and friendly, energetic employees. Delicious drinks. Smoothies for the kiddos. I love going to this place.\\nCons: Poor location. The parking lot is congested so it makes the one line very long and challenging to get through as they sometimes stack people in two lines and try to get them to merge into one.",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for.

Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",
        "Food was good but it all came out 5-10min apart. Actually had to have one dish wrapped up because it never came out. The rice was good and so was the hummus. Will go back but gonna wait a while to see if they get it together",
        "The food is delicious but my only concern would be the customer service. I've been there a few times.Twice, I've been ignored waiting to make an order while waiting in the front. All I see is the employees having a nice chat with another table.",
        "Been there today. My dog got all exiting , thought he will meet some new friends. Just kids and 1 dog on a leash . I'm still searching for a nice , crazy , open dog park. Where is it just for dogs, and they can run around no leash .",
        "I struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars, really should be 1.5.  I agree with others regarding the rude/surly male employee.  I have the impression he is the owner or manager so I am not sure this will ever be addressed.  The salads are good, but value is poor.  Don't waste your time or money.",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  The socially awkward cashier. Punch card is very specific to certain plates even if you're spending more.

Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",

        "Sad experience.  Went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for $10.99.  They only had 3 pieces of chicken.  That's not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left.  The employee made it pretty clear he wouldn't make more.",

I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",

No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30.",

The employees at the greenfield location are so much more personable and helpful.",
        "Possibly the best selection of products when it comes to a Best Buy.  Unfortunately, nothing can make up for employees who say one thing and do another.",
        "Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \\\"Sammy\\\" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \\\"I'll be with you in a moment\\\" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying.",
        "Been going to this car wash for a few years now. It gets slower and slower every time. Sat in waiting area for an hour last time. Not going back. 15 workers and its terrible",
        "Great produce, good small appliance selection and terrible customer service.   We used to shop here weekly, but have stopped in the last couple of years because of the uniformly unfriendly folks at checkout.   Unfortunately, the final impression is always the most lasting.  While the employees in produce, meats and other departments are all really great, the checkers here make shopping a very unpleasant experience",
        "I really was disappointed by the customer service at this store. It seems like the employees really couldn't care less about customers and the company doesn't enforce any sort of respect. It's also messy and cramped! I also tried calling in to ask about an item. I got hung up on twice and every person who answered the phone was rude. Do yourself a favor and make the drive to the Gilbert store.",
        "I had my meal on the premises while with a friend (I usually take it home) and it was a pretty decent experience.  The store is clean and the staff are so friendly they make you feel right at home.  Thanks, PoS!",
        "I can't find anything here! I can't even find a nearby employee to help me. FRUSTRATING!!!!!!",
        "I wrote a review for the JJ on Bell and gave it 4 stars.  A reason for this one at 3.  Same service and good employees.  However the sandwich seem shorted and less delicious.  Lacked on the sprouts and sauce, two necessary plentifulls in my book.  Since I work in the area I will of course revisit.",
        "Been seeing Dr Richards, very professional, always gets me in right when I arrive or shortly after. The whole center has been fabulous.",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "This recently opened bakery/restaurant is owned and operated by a former alumnus of Bouchon.  I stopped in one day on my way back to the hotel and picked up a strawberry Danish  that we shared in the room.  It was different than the traditional Danish, but very tasty. A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate.  I am looking forward to returning for breakfast.",
        "Have visited a few times. Always figured the cigar/cigarette smoke smell was coming from the cigar lounge located next door. Until last visit. I witnessed the cook not only smoking cigarettes while stirring the huge pot of soup broth, he actually was sipping from the huge ladle/spoon \\\"taste testing\\\" and putting it back in to continue stirring! \\n\\nI will never and I mean never return! Unbelievable!",
        "This is one of my favorite Starbucks - not that I drink at any Starbucks particularly often. The location is a big plus, and the workers are always friendly. They are efficient as well - they have to be, considering how much traffic this store gets. If you walk in and see a bit of a line, just know that it tends to move fairly quickly.",
        "These guys are the hardest workers I have ever witnessed. They did an EXCELLENT job with our move and I 100% recommend them.",
        "I did not enjoy my shopping experience at this Office Depot.  I had some specific shipping supplies that I was looking for, and the employees seemed extremely unenthusiastic to help me find them.  After wandering around for a long time unsuccessfully looking for my items, I put what I had found back on the shelf and drove to Staples, where I found the same items for half the price and much friendlier service to boot.",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",
        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "Wonderful employees",
        "Their employees are the rudest human beings alive... The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever. Whatever happened to customer service and pleasing guest. They clearly have no mission they are following at this Sugar Factory in particular, the one in Town Square is def. better!",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Space isn't as visually appealing as the other \\\"snow ice\\\" competitor. Lack of printed menus. Order is handwritten on the container.\\n\\nLIKE  The strawberry condensed milk. Usage of natural ingredients. Lighter/fluffier than its competitor. Egg pudding as a topping.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "I think the employees at this location are fairly friendly for the most part. Though I love most of their selection I do think some of their items are high priced. I would love to buy more supplements or vitamins but I simply can't afford it. I think their free range meat options are lacking.",
        "It's a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront. The few times I've been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors.   The concept is there and I will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes.",
        "Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant.",
        "Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!",
        "Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day.",
        "Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!",
        "Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business.",
        "We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!",
        "love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.",
        "I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls.",
        "I win! I've seen way more elaborate mini-golf parks, this had no flash nor flare. Employees are nice, but for vegas this complex could use more than the overdose of neon lights and glow in the dark one level attractions. Sounds kinda mean but i know its true.",
        "This theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise it's never busy. I've been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when I've gone, I have received great service. I personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors.",
        "My favorite place to get a breakfast at! a great menu and lovely employees.",
        "This CVS has a nice layout and has friendly employees.",
        "WARNING!!!!!! My recommendation is to run, not walk, from Frontier Airlines to the nearest Southwest Airline counter.  My family has lost over $200 in a classic bate and switch ponzi and \\\"shame on\\\" every employee for not standing up for what is right.",
        "I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.",
        "I have been taking my friend who is 91, with Alzheimers,  to this nail salon for years.  It's larger than it looks from the outside.  I don't think they are as sophisticated as some but  that's ok.  What I do appreciate is the way they take the time to continue making it a good experience for my friend.  Maybe I tip them to much.  As long as they continue the service, I will pay.",
        "I was in Vegas for work for only two nights. I went here on a Tuesday night with a few co-workers not sure what to expect. I gave most of my money to the bar and not the casino this night.\\n\\nThe venue satisfied the purpose for being in Vegas. Drinks, dancing, and drinks. The music was above average and I did not have to pay. So for a first experience at Pure, it was not terrible.",
        "What a relief to have found this place ion a late night shortly after arriving Sin City! The guacamole (that they actually make AT your table! :) is a MUST! The food was great & so was the service. My only complaint is the volume of the music-- please take it down a notch!",
        "Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "This Place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY all the time!!!! Lazy employees. Please hire someone other than a nineteen year old for the fast times.",
        "Always quick and good food. Service could get a little better though. Employees always seem like they're hassled to have to take your order.",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "If you want to have your phone fix (cracked screen, water damage etc..) this is the place you want to go for all you phone issues. Great and friendly staff that can fix your phone in a short period of time and at a low price compared to their competitors. They also have many accessories if you would like to pimp out your phone or just want to protect your valued phone.",
        "I guess I didn't order the right sandwich because out of all the awesome reviews my sandwich was just.... OK. I got the Italian and was not really impressed. It was just a small amount of meat and a slice of cheese with stock Italian dressing. So what's the big deal?? Ok I'm gonna have to go back and order something else because I gotta see what all the hype is about! To be continued...",
        "This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain.",
        "Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\\nI ordered 50 wings to go b/c we were heading back to San Diego.  They were hot, but they tasted only ok.  I've had better at other Hooters.\\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",
        "Had lunch with a colleague on a Thursday. Look over the Bento selections and against my better judgement went with the Salmon Teriyaki. Not good, not bad just very average. \\nI like the happy hour, it is always a lively time and drink and food specials are great and deserve 4 stars. Just was not impressed with lunch there.",
        "I order the number two combo which is the combination burrito fries and a coke. The French fries at Del Taco are always good. the combination burrito was very small and bland. the first half of the burrito was all beans and the second half of the burrito was all meat. The place looked fairly clean and the workers seemed nice. I'm here for the food please lets get it right.",
        "I have never gambled here, nor had a meal in any of there Restaurants.  I have really only been here to go see a movie in the theater.  So, with that said.... parking was easy, all of the employees we came into contact with were nice and the signage was easy to follow.  So, I have no complaints nor did I have any expectations.  I will update my review if I ever do anything substantial here.",
        "Great spacious dinning area for family, friends and co workers. Pizza was delivered in a timely maner (20min). Prices are reasonable here. Courteous waiters and clean restaurant.",
        "Had dinner with my co workers .\\nCesar salad covered in garlic, no thanks .\\nOk, I will try a tossed garden salad . \\nHorrible oil dressing. Waitress says no ranch dressing , just odd stuff. \\nDinner came finally. \\nIt was ok , nothing great .",
        "Not so GREAT Clip.... from my experience.  I'm not going to write a book about it, but the service is okay, the workers are disgruntled (bad ownership from what they said), but my BIGGEST pet-peeve, the stations are covered with hair and they didn't clean up prior to me being seated.  I had to ask her to clean up.",
        "Turquoise lilypad canopies glow neon pink at night, while posters beckon you to \\\"consider your future\\\" and get a job here in exchange for free movies.  Solid selection of independent films.  Clean facility, friendly staff.  Nice reprieve from the mallrats at Fashion Square.  **Bonus** I may have been the only individual who did not qualify for the senior discount at the weekday matinee."

        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",

Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\\n\\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive.",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",

Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!",
        "Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it.",
        "Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!",
        "Yum! First time having breakfast here. Great menu with combination of upscale dishes and standards. Large portions. Awesome porch. Bar service. Love how they converted this area landmark. Good happy hour. Solid food and service. So happy to have this restaurant/bar in this area!",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \\nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "Typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals. Definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there. The coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well.",
        "We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",

Service is friendly thats why I am giving 2 stars and a stretch however food is lacking.",

        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again.

        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",

The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",

        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",

        "Great Breakfast food...expecially the skillets.\\nConsistent style and portions...I really like the chicken, bacon, avocado skillet. However, I'm not a big fan of the coffee...i think it's quite bitter. but they have fresh squezzed O.J....and great whole grain pancakes.",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.",
        "Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!",
        "Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.\\nrest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .\\nWeekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.\\nbut weekdays pretty slow.\\nIf you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.",
        "VERY OVER RATED!   SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend.  Charges for in room frig and internet.  Many other extra fees.  OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",
        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.  \\nThe drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.",
        "Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "Excellent brunch/breakfast.  This place offers a variety a breakfast dishes that taste amazing.  I am not a breakfast fan, but this place changed my mind",
        "I fell in LOVE with this place so much that I went back the next day to try more food and cocktails!\\nI LOVE the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing!",
        "Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.",
        "I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!",
        "We were a party of six and ordered 9 items altogether And the food was good. But it took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. One hour before our main dishes appeared. We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd.",
        "This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.",
        "Beautiful campus!! First time attending and have the pleasure of having two exemplary  professors.  This school has a great culinary arts programs as well as an awesome hospitality program!!\\n\\nLove it!",
        "This use to be one of my all time favorite stores! But it has changed soo much. The quality for some shirts or dress and pants is not worth the price. Everything is now like vail material. They use to have quality what happened?",
        "Reviews are pretty much right on. Stiff drinks, good prices for happy hour. Appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips, served on Plastic plates. On par with what Dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint.",
        "I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.",
        "Great place to stop in and have a drink as well as some appetizers. I personally just finished eating when we got to Typhoon, so I didn't get a chance to try their food. \\n\\nThe decor is lounge oriented and modern.  Service was excellent with very nice looking ladies that we're smiling the whole time serving drinks. \\n\\nI would recommend if your close to downtown Montreal.",
        "Fantastic shrimp po-boy!  The ingredients were really fresh, the bread was soft and tasty, the shrimp crispy and the sauce was delicious.  It will be hard getting anything else.  I'll have to though since their other dishes look great as well!",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",
        "Great atmosphere. Excellent Pork dishes.  Empanadas were really greasy, but otherwise everything was perfect.",
        "Good portions and cocktails overall. The best thing I tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer. Stay away from the curry chicken, it was small and didn't have much chicken in it.",
        "This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.",
        "Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again",
        "The food is bad. If you are from LA and NYC then please don't eat her. Nobu prices but tasteless dishes. There only secret is truffle not used properly. \\n\\nIt is gorgeous inside and the service is great but if you are going to spend 300$ on food and saki you shouldn't leave hungry and disappointed.",
        "We like the mall here. There are plenty of stores and shops that \\\"normal\\\" people can shop. We like that there is a good mix of places to eat so we can always find something we both agree on. We also like that the V theater is here so we can decide to see a show last minute and not have to leave the mall. (sin city comedy is great)",
        "This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.",
        "decent place. tvs, outside seating, and a roll of paper towels hanging on every table! i'm definitely a fan of pizza and beer, only you have to drink the beer there (draft- pretty good!), so take out doesn't afford that combination.  they have wine too.  their appetizers seem good, but i just had the pizza (with veggie toppings) which was just ok.  nothing too special here... maybe its location.",
        "I love this place!  It's locally owned and I think it's a family.  They are from Korea, and the menu reflects some Korean specialities as well as terrific, freshly prepared, and beautifully presented sushi.  They have a good happy hour and reasonable non-HH prices.  Please patronize!",
        "Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\\n\\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.",
        "I usually love shopping at outlet malls. But St Jacobs Factory Outlet Mall is just so depressing.\\n\\nThere were hardly any bargains. And the stores and the merchandise were both so outdated. \\n\\nNot worth coming here for a special shopping trip but if you are in the area and have nothing better to do and outside is freezing cold.. then maybe.",
        "Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",
        "I went here with friends and we tried the vegetarian stew and the vegetarian kebab. The stew was too sour and the lentils slightly undercooked. I would not recommend it. However, the kebab was quite good and their zarashk polo was fantastic. Among the appetizers dolmeh were some of the best I have had, but the hummus was ordinary.",
        "I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches.",
        "Standard chipolte. Not cheap on the meat like some stores. Long line during lunch but it moves fast.",
        "Hotel very good and very good location, close to shops and the Staple Center. Parking inside the hotel quite convenient, but a little expensive. The facility, which sits on top of the building is very good and has great view. The hotel restaurant is also good and not too expensive. We take breakfast at Starbucks, it has one inside the hotel.",
        "i love that you can bring your animal inside the store! so many times you purchase items and wonder if the animal will like it or it fits. \\n\\nThe selections are huge for all types of needs for many different animals! the prices are usually reasonable! just wish I wasn't so far away from these stores",
        "Mmmmmmmm appetizer sampler is tasty ... 1/2 price drinks for ladies friday and saturday which means 1/4 price drinks all around!   Nice hockey rink     Hockey on almost every tv   Pizza looks good but am too full to order! Bartenders are cool   Video blackjack dominated us!",
        "If you are going to have a rewards program where you get 1 stamp per sandwich bought and at 10 you get a free one, then it should be 1 stamp per sandwich not per combo ordered. Read your card. My card is in the trash. My family will not ever eat at any branch of this place. There are thousands of sandwich shops and this is only middle of the road at best. All it takes is one little thing to cost you thousands.",
        "went here for the first time & I have to say I was satisfied with their food. we ordered the chicken & beef bulgogi and grilled saury, they were all really delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars for the food & atmosphere alone, but I had to take one star off for slow service & some dishes on the menu are a bit over priced.",
        "The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)",
        "Great menu. Awesome food. Place was packed and had a wait for good reason! I There is pretty much every thing you can imagine on the breakfast menu and all the dishes that came to our table were great and the portions huge (you could easily split!).",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else."

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good. I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!",
        "Only place in Vegas that has AYCE sashimi! The restaurant itself looks outdated and old but I honestly just care for the sashimi, oysters and soft shell crab! Service can be improved upon but overall good.",
        "The oysters here were really good. The price here is very fair for seafood. Although the reason that I'm giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt. We ordered the seafood gumbo and I had to take a gulp of water everytime I took a bite of my gumbo.",
        "Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.",
        "This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "Are you kidding me with the salt?  Ordered the steak main course with side of fries.  Could not believe how salty it was....\\n\\nEnjoyed the oysters the most.  But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. \\n\\nToo much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back..",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",

        "The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.",
        "Highly recommend this place for amazing juice and food options! The staff is friendly and always willing to give samples to get a sense of taste for their menu. The Jump Start is my favorite juice!",
        "Oysters good. Chicken was smelly. Adult tater tots good. Took our servicer for.ever. to split our checks. Mediocre across the board.",
        "I'm not sure why they call themselves barcelona, not very authetic spanish cooking. but the tapas are good. they could have a bigger selection of tapas. service was excelant. check them out on half price night!!! And try the Sangrias, free samples are available...",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",
        "No, no, no, no no!!!\\n\\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again",
        "We couldn't get a table at Emeril Lagasse's place. So, we ended up here it was in the same hotel. The Oysters on the Half Shell and Tuna Tataki and Tartare was okay but pricey. For my main dish I had the Crispy Duck Breast. Pretty good it was a good thing I stay up the whole night after that dinner.",
        "\\\"Good, Good, and.....GOOD!\\\" I always come for the cocktails and Thai Chicken Wraps. Service is good and I like the atmosphere, but some advice, \\\"Get there nice and early for seating on a weekend\\\".",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip.",
        "Awesome! I'm here for business and planned on trying someplace new every day...I had Thai House for lunch and I'm tempted to go back for dinner.\\n\\nShrimp & chicken pad Thai, level 3 spiciness add pineapples! Service was quick. Food flavor robust.",
        "I don't know what to say-I have been all over the world and this place is among the top three restaurants I've ever been to. The oyster selection is immense. We tried three varieties, all spectacular, but the one the server recommended (wildcat) was probably the best oyster I've ever had. \\n\\nI didn't know seafood could be this good on the east coast. I cannot recommend this place enough!",
        "One of the worse dining experiences I've ever had. Our \\\"waiter\\\" gregorio, screwed up every aspect of our meal, including not splitting our check properly as requested, and mixing the receipts up afterwards. Then today I realized that he double charged us for our meal and tip. Now we have to deal with getting our extra $ back.   DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :(",
        "this place is so delicious and cheap.  Very friendly and fast.\\n\\nAsk for no MSG and free delivery.\\n\\nThey give you a lot of food.  great for a local neighborhood thai place.",
        "If you want more of an upscale feel of a casino then look no further! Make sure you bring plenty cash because the winnings over here are a lot less likely. I mean it's vegas and once you find your favorite place to gamble stick to it. It's one of those to each is own kind of situations but I rather not gamble here. Never had much luck but have friends who have!",
        "Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!",
        "Yes, its pricey but so worth every bit of it.  \\nrack of lamb is amazing.  never do I eat lamb but I have the last four times I went.  \\nFabulous martinis and great oyster selections.  Be sure to tell them no pepper on the Oysters...why they do that, who knows but they do.  Good oysters need no spices.\\nIts really not a place for children but my 5 year old enjoyed it.",
        "When I lived in the area, I used to come here a lot both to eat in and take out. The quality has gone down a bit over the last year - the last few times we went, the service wasn't great, the portions are getting smaller, plus they are giving too many vegetables and not enough meat. However, they do make a great Pad Thai.",
        "Just average food with exception of the chicken lollipops. Cool ambiance and good service",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "Great chicken fingers. Bland and boring coleslaw. Regular old krinkle cut fries. Come for the chicken fingers and cane sauce, skip the rest.",
        "Amazing dinner experience! We had dinner on Christmas night. Set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing. The meal was glorious... Especially the chestnut soup with scallops. Service was spot-on! We had a wonderful evening and can't wait to return!",
        "Had the breakfast wrap. It had so much oil in it. I mean tons of oil dripping everywhere. I always thought of pei Wei as the healthier option, not anymore.",
        "I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I can not get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house.\\nStick with small bakeries .",
        "I am not one for a college bar hangout.  I have been brought here several times and I have to say that those several times have been lackluster.\\n\\nThe food was good bar fare with giant portions.  I haven't tried the oysters yet. Soon.\\n\\nMy rec is go here for a late 2 martini lunch.",
        "Great food!\\n\\nWe had the pineapple rice, papaya salad, red curry chicken and stuffed chicken wings... all great.\\n\\n2nd best Thai that I have had in L.V.... Lotus of Siam is still the best!",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "this place is great'' I would highly recomend this buffet to everyone who go to vegas. first thing was the pizza it was good and big.second was the pasta tortaini with the alfrado sasue.third was the sushi it was small but it was good and last but not least the dessert was awsome the puding was nice and creamy and the fruit was fruity and the chessecake was magnificent  everything in the buffet was good.",
        "Don't go here expecting much. It's really just not very good. My mom said her yellow curry lacked flavor, too many onions and was very runny. I got the kung pao chicken lunch special, barely any chicken, just mostly the other stuff they make it with, and a couple scraps of chicken mixed in. Tasted okay, but just disappointing all around. I did like the thai tea though.",
        "I love this place! I think of it a lot like the Cheers of Vegas. Since moving here I find most of the local spots to be riddled with assholes, but anytime I happen to meander into the Label I feel right at home. Drink prices are average, the Thai food is good, but the staff is the best!",
        "If you can somehow overlook the price..\\nJust know its worth it. Everything I tried was good!! Out of all the things my fav was the Thai basil rice with egg. Lol I'm Asian what can you say..",
        "this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal, let alone the best thai i've ever had. everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere, i constantly compare it to bangkok and how i'd just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt.",
        "HORRIBLE customer service!! After 10 years of my 5 children seeing them and hoping each time they might be more friendly or accommodating, but continuing because we live so close. We are done with you Mesa Pediatrics! We are paying customers with great insurance, you could care less. We are taking our money elsewhere!",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Good new Thai place in Mesa. Compared to Thai Patio, the portions are huge and just as good, and they usually get the spicy level just right for both me (3.5 on a 1-5 scale) and my girlfriend (2) on the curry. They have a fried shrimp appetizer that's also pretty good - definitely my favorite Thai in the area.",
        "fun music and vacation atmosphere in the heat of tempe summer...\\n\\nbut we won't be back. \\n\\nmargaritas were so salty, beers were watery, and food was too spicy - the kind of spicy that drowns out the flavor (and this is coming from a Thai-Hot kinda girl).  \\n\\nFood/drinks are reasonable, but it was a total waste of money.",
        "Large portions, great quality, lots of options, Henderson location is awesome, the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome! \\nI would say that Pinkaow's traditional thai dishes are comparable to Lotus of Siam's and that they are simply just less busy.",
        "Yum. Very healthy and fresh. The potstickers were delicious. My only complaint is that they are always out of white meat (chicken). Not sure what that is about. LOL\\n\\nWanted to update the review...I tried the boba here and it was terrible. Way undercooked. The service isn't too great either.",
        "There's so many yummy Thai places I can't keep up these days. I love the customer service here, it has an americanized atmosphere because of that, but the food is still true to it's culture. By the time we finished eating and were ready for dessert, they had already run out of their mangos and sticky rice which we were so desperate to try. It was a sad moment, but just another reason to go back.",
        "It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking.",
        "Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and for the most part it was a good experience and good food. The service was good too. Waiter was very courteous and explained everything about themselves and the menu. We ordered the two cups of crab bisque which was good, oysters Rockefeller which I thought was ok, stone crab legs were good, crab cakes and lobster sole which was our main dishes were ok. Overall it was a good experience and service was good.",
        "Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with \\\"special sauce\\\" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it.",
        "Delicious Thai food! \\nWe enjoyed the -\\n\\nPad Thai veggie : 4 star excellent taste and texture!\\nDrunken noodles chicken : 5 star- incredible flavor!\\nRed curry chicken: 5 star very good!\\nGreen curry pork 4 star yum!! \\n\\nIf I lived here it would be my go-to Thai place!!!\\n\\nKeep up the good work !",
        "This is my favorite Thai restaurant in CLT. I LOVE the Pad Thai and shrimp rolls. The food is fresh, service is excellent and location 5 minutes from home. What's not to love about it?",
        "AMAZING\\n\\nI just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. I love this place. I can't believe it took me this long to stop in! I had the Pad Thai and eggroll. This food is fresh tasting, fulfilling, and pretty inexpensive. I would recommend this place to anyone.",
        "They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery.",
        "Nice but the menu it is stil the same  for the past 6 years...we are in Montreal \\n\\nAnyways, the best dish for me is the radish oyster  cannot get enough of the stuff. 12CAD$ for 4 oysters is well worth it\\n\\nthe rest to my taste was quite ordinary, not worth the money",
        "Incredible food and service!  I had their pumpkin curry,  very good... unlike many Thai restaurants this one has a heat scale from 1 to 5 and I ordered a 5.  Now I like my curry spicy but a 5 might have been too much.    Try the green tea ice cream,  its delicious.   I will return to this gem.",
        "I have never gambled here, nor had a meal in any of there Restaurants.  I have really only been here to go see a movie in the theater.  So, with that said.... parking was easy, all of the employees we came into contact with were nice and the signage was easy to follow.  So, I have no complaints nor did I have any expectations.  I will update my review if I ever do anything substantial here.",
        "Service was good. Clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down. They were different sizes and flavors. I also wouldn't order the crab legs.  They were pretty average. There is a dish (called roasted crab with sauce?) that is very good.  I would recommend that and the chowders.",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "The desserts failed.\\n\\nFood was good. I was really hyped up to go here from the reviews...it was not that amazin but food was good. Indonesian curries , prime rib , etc.....sushi was surprisingly fresh for a buffet.",
        "First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.",
        "Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!",
        "One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!",
        "Came here on Monday night.  Heard lots of good reviews.  Their hip hop room is very small.  Not a lot of good music was playing (compared to Vanity).  The pool area was packed, the main room was the best place to be.  A mixture of house, electronic, & hip hop.  Packed as well.  The library SUCKS!",
        "Great atmosphere.  Love the back patio.  Definitely has a new hip feel to it.  Food was awesome.  Careful with the peanuts they serve when you sit down....amazing and highly addictive!  \\n\\nWe had the green curry, pad see ew, pad Thai shrimp, and chicken satay.  All were excellent.\\n\\nService was great.  Really busy.",
        "Honestly, wings are probably my favorite food on the planet. I'll get them any way I can. BWW always has good variety and plays just about every sporting event known to man, which makes this place all the better for me. I'll be spending a lot of time here during football season. My new love is the Thai curry.",
        "Edit:  I don't like this place anymore!  Last experience- the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want (and so less pad thai).  Also service was really slow for lunch.  It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares.",
        "This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).",
        "MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food.",
        "Tried to give this little place to evolve into a great neighborhood joint... Instead it raised its prices within the first month on mediocre food. A couple months later it still is serving Spring rolls stuffed with brown rice not veggies, bad Pad Thai that was too lemony to eat and tasteless chicken. The decor is nearly as bad as the food. When in the area I will dine at one of the neighboring restaurants.",
        "Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "Ive been to many all you can eat sushi places, but this has to be the best one. All the food was great quality and really delicious. I loved the soft shelled crab and the oysters. $22 is not bad for the quality and quantity you get. Great place overall!",
        "Beautiful new Thai restaurant. Great atmosphere, excellent service and absolutely delicious food.  The 2 course lunch special is a great deal.  I will definitely put Gaati on my short list of favorite restaurants!  Plus the owners ROCK =))",
        "Never again....I have tried this place twice now.  First time was a NYE party and now just to hang out and gamble.  Each time sucked!  I got suckered into bottle service for 500 bones and now just dropped 100 bucks at keno.  What a complete waste of time.  Also, why didn't anyone tell me there was a freakin loer yuppie convention in town???",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "I had the Pad See Ew.  It was pretty mediocre - too sweet, slight burnt taste and not very flavorful.  Food presentation was lousy, just dumped on the plate without garnish.  Service was indifferent, even though there were few customers.  There are much better and still authentic Thai restaurants in town.",
        "Lunch special only  till 4 pm . $7.99. Okay food nothing special that would make me want to come back. Service was just OK. Overall, I have had way better thai food else where .",
        "Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !",
        "This place blows.  Staff doesn't have a clue about customer service, (except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio).  Food was blah.  Spring rolls with out Thai basil, seriously? Pho was alright, but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoiled.\\n\\nHorrible, no. Below average, yes.",
        "If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving. You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America. Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout.",
        "Love it! Very intertaining. Way better than I thought about a hynosis show.",
        "I've been going to Phuket for several years. The food is on par if not better than other Thai restaurants I've been to in the city. The curry dishes are very flavourable.  The menu has also been expanding adding in other Asian dishes. Throw in excellent friendly service and you have a nice eating experience in the East End.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Awesome!!!! Not your typical Mexican restaurant. Their brunch is out of this world. Gourmet steak and eggs gourmet oysters Rockefeller gourmet green fried tomatillos. Gourmet bananas Foster crapes! At eat myself sick.",
        "Food was excellent. Had the potstickers and sushi sampler. Karen was our server. However was dissapointed waiting 35 mins for our check after table was cleared and dessert was already refused. Plus, excessive chit chat while waiting for our bill while still in plain sight is very unprofessional.",
        "Dave is an amazing person who will do well at whatever he does, but I am afraid he stood us up this morning and when we contacted him to find out where he was, he told my husband that he is really no longer in the sprinkler business.  This makes me very, very sad! I loved him and I adored working with him."

        "Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.",

        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "I love Metta Yoga.  The instructors are so warm and helpful, and the other students too are not afraid to laugh and also help me \\\"get\\\" a pose.  Awesome vibes to this place.  I bought a package deal so I could come again after my first free class.",
        "Decent food. But.... I ordered an Irish coffee, and they gave me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey on the side. I asked the bartender if she knew how to make this simple drink. She said, \\\"we don't do that here\\\". Wow. I asked for the remaining ingredients, and I was charged for each individual ingredient. $17.00 Irish coffees at Brazwells. Condescending staff.",
        "Came here on a Friday night to have a drink at the prohibition bar located in the casino. I was impressed by how the dealers and dancers in the middle of the floor never stopped shaking and bouncing. It really helped in keeping the energy up in the room. The tables were busy and so was the bar, but the service was still good. Additionally, their vallet is always super nice.",

        "My husband and I love, love, love the pizza. It all comes down to the crust and sauce which are both hand made each day. We always get the same waiter to serve and knows what we want. Great for a weeknight meal.",
        "This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "Riki and John are two of the best bartenders in Vegas. The bar is loud, fun, and great drinks.",
        "This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.",
        "Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction.",

        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",

        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",

        "first off i am not a fan of this place at all. There are various places in charlotte with the same set up doing it way better.

        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied.

Buildings are awkwardly set up. Had to walk down a hall literally the length of a football field to get to our room, no stair access from first floor. Rooms were very nice though. Very large bathrooms and great patio space. Grills for cooking outside are super clean.",

Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",
        "All of their food is great. Servers always have an opinion on what you should try if you're indecisive, and they're always spot on! Bartenders are fun and always attentive, but not too in-your-face. Great place to catch dinner and/or drinks with friends or family!",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",
        "What happened?!!! Used to be the best now I'm editing my 5 star to a 1. Lost all care, quality, and pure taste. Staff fails. Bartenders are subpar. It's just not an enjoyable experience anymore. It's like the owners threw in the towel.",
        "I love this place for 1 reason and that is the staff!! I enjoyed going to Mermaids and sitting at the back bar talking to a bartender named Raquel. She was the reason why I came to this place so often. I recently stopped by there and found out she no longer works there and was bummed out. She was super friendly and always served me and my friends with a friendly smile.",

Without fail when shopping there isn't a time that at least one item I'm looking for is always out of stock.",
        "Cardboard crust, canned sauce. Nothing special. But if you're starving and only have $2 in your pocket, this will tide you over. Nothing more.",
        "They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??",
        "Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\\n\\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.",

Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.",

We did a full on tequila tasting and got a little lesson in each brand. His service was top notch. The food was good, but I think the tequila was my favorite part.",

I wouldn't go back even if I was staying in the same hotel.",

        "I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I can not get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house.\\nStick with small bakeries .",

        "We sat at the bar for some dinner.  There were only a few people there, yet it took forever to get anything.  The bartender was friendly, but was not happy she had to be.  The food is blah.  I had the potato stuffed with ham, bacon and cheese.  It was a large portion, but the flavor was bland.  My friend eating with me had a similar experience.",
        "I am not one for a college bar hangout.  I have been brought here several times and I have to say that those several times have been lackluster.\\n\\nThe food was good bar fare with giant portions.  I haven't tried the oysters yet. Soon.\\n\\nMy rec is go here for a late 2 martini lunch.",
        "Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs",
        "I love this place! The pork green chili Mac n cheese is so good I dream about it! Mojitos are awesome made by the guy bartender who is super friendly and sweet! We always sit at the bar! Just a really cool place to have some really good food!",
        "I dropped into this gym while traveling for work. The staff was amazingly inviting and friendly.  The facilities were spacious and new.  The workout was rewardingly tough.  I can't say enough good things about this gym.  If you are contemplating joining a cross-fit gym, I highly recommend.",
        "Mmmmmmmm appetizer sampler is tasty ... 1/2 price drinks for ladies friday and saturday which means 1/4 price drinks all around!   Nice hockey rink     Hockey on almost every tv   Pizza looks good but am too full to order! Bartenders are cool   Video blackjack dominated us!",
        "We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice.",
        "I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find.",
        "Gluten-free crust was underdone and not very tasty. :(",
        "Went to Steak n Shake today looking for the real thing from the Midwest.  It was not.  The menu is very limited and ripping people off with a 6.99 organic steak burger.  Steak n Shake burgers are supposed to be thin and this was not.  It was a greasy mess.  I could not finish it because it was laying all over the box.  Won't go back.",
        "Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!",
        "Love to rock climb... But the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient! Won't be going back here because of them",
        "On paper, happy hour sounds great. In reality, it sucked for us. Drinks were very pricey and the food was okay, even at 50% off. However our bartender was very rude and snarky. She had a rather bitchy attitude. Go to Brooklyn Bowl for better food and drink prices.",
        "I ordered the 4 pc fried chicken (I think it was $5.29). It came with fries and a couple rolls. The chicken was ok. The fries were too salty. There was a lot of food for $6.\\n\\nYou probably want to phone in your order before coming here because it's kinda greasy inside. \\n\\nI'll probably come back and try their philly cheesesteak.",
        "Happy we have another bar in charlotte,  but have been there twice now and the wait for a drink does not make sense.  When you are paying a bartender $8 an hour and charging $8 dollars a drink do the math.  I wish you well, bit not sure I will go back.  Get it together guys.......",
        "Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \\\"gym\\\" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \\n\\nI would highly recommend to anyone.",
        "My wife and I really enjoy going to this Carvel + Schlotsky's restaurant.  They have really delicious sourdough crust pizzas (I love the BBQ-Chicken & Jalape\\u00f1o) and tasty ice-cream treats.   Free-wifi and cold raspberry lemonade help make it a great place to go.",
        "Nice trendy bar which is frequented by locals and students alike , good food at reasonable prices , students get good deals , loads of plasma tv's showing sport all day.",
        "Great beer selection, great atmosphere, great bartenders. What more can I say? Perfect for someone wanting to enjoy a beer with good friends. Monday night is the night for great specials but I prefer to go the other nights of the week when The Saucer is a bit quieter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is has nothing good to say about Charlotte night life, this will certainly change your mind. Give the fresh pretzels with queso a try!",
        "Worst bar I've ever been to. I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer. The bartenders are rude, the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude. Also,  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there. No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet. Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.",
        "Food was good but I was quite surprised when my Gin Martini got delivered and the lemon twist floating in it still had the sticker from the grocery store/orchard...clearly the bartender that peeled the twist and rimmed the glass with it, as well as the server that brought it didn't think twice about the fact that there was blatantly a large sticker that said, \\\"Sunkist\\\" floating in the drink as well",

The cook is dirty... don't get me wrong the food is great... But don't eat if Chef Rudy is cooking he's dirty he does dirty nasty to the food..",
        "Home of the $1.50 burger!!! But their wings are really good, grilled or regular. Always a local crowd at the bar watching games on theor millions of screens. Bartenders are all very attentive, beer is cold. They have specials Tues and Wed.  LIke half price wings and tacos. No complaints. Nice, homey joint. Oh and they have a $3 breakfast!! For the morning after.",
        "Just an ok show. Not worth the time and money!\\nA live band would have been better otherwise we could just stayed home and listened to our CDs. \\nLots of dancers and I guess they tried to describe the songs, but they look so disorganized on stage!",
        "Great service... Very attentive. My wife and I interviewed numerous DJs before we met and immediately hired DJ Shai for our wedding. You can trust him to incorporate the musical and themes you want as well as keep the party going.",
        "Terrible gym, bad hours, close entire gym for maintenance without warning, lots of staff that do nothing because weights always everywhere, so many people there you have to wait for everything...good reviews here only for price which is pretty good.",
        "Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back."

        "The place was clean and bright. The portions/burgers were small but OK. My buddy had the Chicken Parmesan burger and though it was small - he raved about it. Specifically the sauce. The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \\\"Colorado cigarettes\\\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.",
        "I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",

If you look rough and speak poorly you get the judge's sympathy and are allowed to speak where he will kindly listen. If you're dressed respectively, he'll cut you off and give you minimum payments of $100 a month ;(",
        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

        "Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!  They were short handed due to unexpected departure of an employee and went out of their way to make sure the customers left happy.  Food was fresh and delicious, love that grilled pita.  Will be going back again soon!",

We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",
        "This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.",
        "I am a loyal customer and love the place! The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",

        "Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",

If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut.",
        "oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um, well, it was silken tofu.  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal.  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",

        "Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!",

However this place loses a star because when you order for pick up, you get very little food. Disappointing for the price you pay. You almost want to eat in the restaurant every time because only then do do you get the amount of food you pay for.",
        "Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye",
        "The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.",

        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.",
        "This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)",
        "Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper.",
        "We went to Raceway Bar & Grill  it is kind of away from the town but it was a treat. Food and service great. Lots of collectables to see. Pizza was different but awesome.we would go back for sure. Rand the owner made the experience even better. Had an Amber beer which was great to.",
        "Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.",
        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!",
        "We stay here but the bathroom door lock was broken.  The room was nice the hotel was big.  Alot of stuff to see but our view wasn't great because we were looking at the back side of the Hotel all we to check out was the room and parking.  We should of  ask for a view.",
        "I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\\\"s just an okay place with good food",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",

The wine and cheese basket I sent for my sister's birthday never arrived. When I finally got a hold of someone who could explain, he told me that someone spaced it. I also received a couple half-assed apologies. Awful customer service.",

        "I was here for about 10 minutes bc we were roaming through all the Palms clubs/bars and I really liked it. The place is definitely tiny compared to the other clubs around but the music was good and I loved the huge booth seating. Also, their patio is pretty big and the view is nice. I'd definitely come back here to start off the night.",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location",
        "This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \\n\\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\\n\\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \\n\\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree.",
        "not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.",
        "Large cake portions. Good selection of macaroons. But I thought the almond croissant was way too sweet. I love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and I couldn't even finish the small portion. The almond croissant from La Belle Terre was much much better.",
        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",
        "Eat lunch here today, ordered a beer any tacos, the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip, the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill... Thanks for the cut lip.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here.",
        "My husband said it very accurately: \\\"its a once in a lifetime experience.\\\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.  It seems to me that the sandwiches are not anything great once you look past its size.  I ate it with the fries and cole slaw, but I could have done without the fries.  It is just a filler.\\nThe atmosphere as fun and very casual.",
        "Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest.",
        "Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "new remodel did them good.\\n\\nRooms smelled of smoke, even though it was non-smoking.  (room 1789)\\n\\nstaff were great though and the location is really good especially if you have a car.  Easy in/out of the strip area",

        "Took my wife here last week with flu symptoms, it wasn't very busy but it still took about an hour and a half before we left. The wait time was okay considering there was only one doctor for the whole place. The nurse was not overly friendly as she asked all the questions that we already filled out on their forms. I suppose the establishment serves its purpose when you can't get in to see your primary care doctor.",
        "Conveniently located. Fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit. They also do takeaway pastry (mediocre looking pastry), sandwiches, and beverages.\\n\\nPeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though! JEEBUS that stuff was scalding. My latte was out to torture tongues.",
        "Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol",
        "Meh. Pretty boring in my opinion. I cant think of any particular segments were I thought it was funny/cool. \\n\\nThe last 10minutes was entertaining though. Or maybe I was just excited for the show to finally be over. I dont know. \\n\\nDont recommend.. at all.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "You want a fantastic breakfast with a southwestern twist?  You found it.\\n\\nMy favorites are the enchiladas and eggs with pork green chili. Or the green chili meatloaf and eggs.  Or the tenderloin benedict with jalapeno hollandaise!  It's really just hard to go wrong here.\\n\\nA bit tricky to find as there is no sign but take the time and hunt it down I promise you'll love it!",
        "I've been thinking to stop by forever so I finally did.\\n\\nI'll keep this review short and simple. It's OK. If you're around, give it a shot (there's not much in that side of the 101) but don't drive more than 2 miles for that. Just saying.",
        "If you are Colombian (Like me) then I would say this is a descent Colombian bakery, Pandebono, Pan de Yuca, empanadas and arepas are good, finger food per say, the other main dishe.....well...not so sure, but finger food is good, also really good colombian Coffee ( Cafe con Leche) I come here quite regularly for my Chicharron con arepa and pandebonos.",
        "I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me.",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "Dear Montreal,\\n\\nThank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout).  Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen.  Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \\n\\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon.",
        "Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...",
        "This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.",
        "Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at, cursed at, watched ppl get punched, and had a very good cheeseburger at the same time. It was a lot of fun. The burger was really good for a grill & the homemade chips were off the charts! The grill was filled with men who enjoyed being yelled at by the female owner! Good times & good food! Don't take young kids",
        "Extremely slow service.... go elsewhere!\\n\\nQuality of the food wasn't bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out.",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Slooooow service. Food was cold when I got it. Staff is friendly enough, they just need more staff on for the Friday rush.",
        "We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!",

        "My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.",
        "Staff nice, but forgetful. The food was cold and bland. Wish I had checked them out here first. No wonder no one was in there.",
        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "My guy is probably going to be upset that I'm dissing the Great Steak, but it was not my pick. I'm okay with compromising when he's that excited about it though. \\n\\nHe really wanted a Great Steak, which is technically a cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato. We just ordered one to split. I wasn't as excited about it as he was, but that's life.",
        "This is really cool. It's a nice lil' hike and adventure to take when visiting the viewpoints and natural history of the Phoenix area. \\n\\nBest to visit at sunset!",
        "Geez, just because I wasn't dressed in a suit after my long drive into town doesn't mean you should ignore me and pretend I don't even exist. Shoot, even a \\\"hello, good afternoon\\\" goes a long way. I would know, because I work retail. So stop being snobbish a-holes and acknowledge your clientele, you stuck-up blue blood douchebags. Your store definitely lost a sale that day.",

        "If you are looking for a nice, stressfree getaway, I warn you not to stay at the Four Seasons Scottdale. The hospitality, communication skills (or lack their of) are by far the worst I've experienced in all of my travels. As I will get into details once I've checked into my next destination, i warn you at all costs not to stay at this hotel. It is by far the worst (what they call) luxury hotel experience.",
        "They announced today they are closing. As you can see due to my previous review I am not surprised. Sad but not suprised.",
        "Checked in and 2 hours later checked out.  There was no working wifi service in my room, nobody answering the switchboard, no replies from management, nobody available to help me out. Its a shame when management is so poor that a guest leaves feeling this way.",
        "Good burger and dog.  Great shake.  Great service.  Fast in.   Manager checked on us.   Fries a little cold.   A bit pricey but so is rest of Vegas!",
        "Cold food at 11:45 buffet. Will never go back.\\n\\nWatery as hell Tikka Masala and butter chicken.if you're used to the chandler location this one is nothing like it. Different recipes altogether.\\n\\nSkip this is you like Real Indian food.\\n\\nMight change my review if they actually invited me back for some HOT food. Im upset I did not leave.",

I have had robata at Katana on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and at Wolgang Puck's Robata restaurant in Vegas but this place tops them both! Very delicious and creative menu!! I will make Baku a regular stop when I come back to town!",
        "It is what it is. What was really crystallised for me on this my 5th trip to Las Vegas is you just have to surrender and spend the money because you really, truly cannot really be on the cheap. The portions were pretty big but I imagined kind of a mass produced assembly line in the kitchen. The food will keep you alive but it won't bring you joy.",
        "Went here for drinks for one night. They called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out, making my friend chug her beer. And meanwhile it wasn't closing time yet. Very crappy service.",
        "The food  was great  too bad the service was terrible.  I would go back but would make sure I did not get the same server.  It would have earned them a 4 star.  It was not just that the kitchen was backed up, she was not even friendly or checked on us.",
        "Worst customer service. They are so rude!  I go there because it is right down the street from my work. The cashiers are not friendly, the staff is not helpful and if you go there within 30 minutes of closing,  they are even more rude. If possible.",
        "Good food. OK prices. Just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever. You can't expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though.",
        "I retained her fraudulent representations she set forth in a series of  emails, which contradicted each other as she back-pedalled and apologized. Bottom line, her apologizes were as empty as most Arizona rivers. Not professional.. Even her pic must be 25 years old.",
        "Burrito Drive almost single-handedly saves deilvery food in Madison from boredom and closing too early.  The food is fresh and hand-made, easy to customize and not what you'd expect (and that sweet potato business is AMAZING!).  Delivery is usually very quick, accurate and friendly even at 2am.   \\n\\nI do wish it was a little less expensive, but I realize the value in paying more for fresh and hand-made and delivered to my door.",
        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.",

        "Just wanted to update. Manager contacted us. Was willing to give full refund or have the top installed for free. Seems there was a communication issue. Issue was resolved, even kept the truck box cover. Did have an issue, but company did resolve in a timely manner and apologized for the miscommunication",

Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.",
        "We bought a Boston Terrier puppy from the Puppy Boutique a year ago. The owner was very helpful. We played with many dogs and stayed there a while. The owner and staff was very friendly. The also gave a military discount! Our puppy has never been ill and is of good breeding! I would go back ( if I could afford it!)",
        "I kept paying for monthly service and I don't know why.  The house was never really clean - just wiped down. \\n\\nThey rushed through the job wiping surfaces and pushing dirt around. \\n\\nI sent pictures of how dirty our tile floors were AFTER they cleaned and talked to them about the floors on several occasions. \\n\\nIt's too bad, but the attention to detail and a little TLC are completely lacking with this company.",
        "After living in Japan for 4 years, I'm very particular about the kind of ramen I eat. However, Ramen Sora blew my taste buds. The corn butter ramen with miso broth was decadent, rich, and literally melted in my mouth. I get it everytime I come here. It's average price, about $8-$10 a bowl, but it is so worth it.",
        "Last night was my first time here, and I enjoy Ingrosso.  That aside it was too loud, waaayy too loud.  It was impossible to talk to my friends.  \\n\\nThe venue itself seems thrown together.  It's too large--now I see why Marquee closes off sections as it gets later and why Light closes the balcony off on slow nights.\\n\\nYou won't see me here again.",
        "We just checked into this hotel, and it's beautiful!  The front desk staff were so nice and friendly.  We're staying in an Executive Suite, so we expect niceness, but it's more than expected.  When we entered our room, our fireplace was already turned on for us - so was the music.  I'm going to enjoy staying here so much---I'm so spoiled!!!",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",

Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame. \\n\\nI could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!",
        "What's the point of opening until midnight when vendors are closing left and right and others are out of specials! What are we paying for?",
        "Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one. I've never seen food service staff move so quickly as when you walk in here at 20 mins. till closing time. They want you to inhale your food and get out. The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)",
        "Normally I'm a cool headed person but when you manage to mess up two flights and then proceed to lose my carrying you insisted needed to go under the plane. I think I have a fair reason to be upset. I understand things happen but when I have been in three cities and each person I tried to speak with was incompetent and unable to get anything done I tend to get a little upset. Sorry but you have officially lost my business forever.",
        "Disappointing...a long list of beers that they brew and only 3 were checked as available - what???\\n\\nNice patio, friendly service and the wood fired pizzas looked good too, but I couldn't get past the limited types of beer offered.",
        "This location closing.  Going out of business sale going on now (9/2013).  if the parking lot was this packed all the time they would not be closing.  I don't hate Wmart, I just hate being left with nothing but Wmart.",
        "Wish I could give it zero stars. Sorry to bother your early evening couch straightening   Party you had going on. Only people in the restaurant and we didn't get checked on once. I would have kept drinking the margaritas all night if someone would have asked. I was so upset we walked out of the nugget completely. Oh well.",
        "My family and I tried this for the first time about a week ago. The food was unique, and very good for adults, but my kids freaked out about it. They had very unique draft beers and unusual drink choices.  It was a little Spendey, but we really enjoyed the change.  Great happy hour prices and happy hour every day of the week.",
        "Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!",
        "Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \\nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue. Took a taxi over a month ago because I assumed they would be showing the ufc fights. No such luck, sports bar anyone?\\nWas a fun night anyway with beer, darts and conversation. Would definately go back.",

        "This is a decent place to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and some nosh with a friend.  I would give it five stars but I'm rather turned off by the inside seating area.  This place is best when you can sit outside in cool weather.  Especially around sunset =)\\n\\nOccasionally they do have live music playing outside which adds to the ambiance of the dimly lit evenings.  A relaxing atmosphere that I think is a must to enjoy =)",

The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",
        "Went there saturday night and the waitress was horrible, horrible, horrible.  She was snotty, rude and should not be working with customers.  It took an hour to get our food which were only apps and 2 hamburgers.  The food was good but my hamburger was on the cold side.  We all assumed that the food was probably sitting around for awhile.  If you want crappy service this is the place for you.",

The stage area and dance floor is rather small but the light show and effects really make up for it if you can find your way out there. Overall I definitely much preferred Marquee over Tryst and Surrender.",

        "Worst experience ever! Why does a hookah bar open at noon but won't serve hookah until 4 pm? Four employees here chatting and on their phones neglecting to help or even acknowledge other patrons. It's the end of December and their heaters outside don't work? Have been here for 45 minutes and not checked on once by any employee at all. Worst customer service experience in all of Vegas.",
        "The worst customer service experience. Unfortunately for them, my expectations for customer service are a bit higher seeing that this is a higher end Vegas spot...but damn. Just really upsetting.",
        "Fun.  Like many things in Vegas, this copy of the Munich Hoffbrau Haus has all of the form and none of the substance.  If you're looking for an authentic experience, this only partly fits that bill.  That said, the place is blast and I've always had a good time.",
        "After being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar.  We then found out they were out of lager.  How the hell can a brewery be out of lager?  The food was decent, the service was below average, and the crowd was the usual here in Glendale, old white folks.",
        "Beware of the \\\"Cat nazi Lady\\\" my Family and I went there to adopt a cat for our home and she was rude and impolite to us and wouldn't  show us the cat we picked out from the window. This lady should be checked out in a psycho ward lol. Poor cat would've have a very nice home.",
        "Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(",
        "This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",
        "This is pretty average. A couple of friends and I stopped by right around closing time, and the nice hostess was really nice about taking us in, which we appreciated. Other than that nice gesture, all I can say is that their food was average and merits a 3 star review. From what I can see their service was comparable. Pretty good portions for the price paid!",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "Food was okay, but expected better.  We were the last customers in on a weekday and we finished before closing time, but we felt rushed.  Overall experience wasn't very pleasant.",
        "I was very upset to find out that this theater charged me the admissions price of 5.00 for my 6 month old grand daughter who cannot even sit up alone to take up a seat. I was told by employee's there that everyone is charged a price during the first 2 weeks of a new movie showing. I feel this was a great rip off and she could not take advantage of the free popcorn, so basically I paid 5.00 for the small free popcorn. Very upset.",
        "We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.",
        "I think this place has potential. Right now it is still working out the kinks. The day I was there the Manager was taking down to the cashier which really upset me and made me want to leave. The food itself is good but could be better. Once the place gets rolling and gets its rhythm I think they'll be a 4 star hot dog joint.",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.",
        "Used to love this place til their white woman employee was rude to me when I came in 30 minutes before closing. Came back a week later, told the owner, and he defended her. Nothing special about this place, so I will go to one of the other gazillion nail places in this town.",
        "Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "From a business traveler perspective, I have nothing bad to say about this Avis at the Phoenix Airport.  As others have indicated in their reviews, it is worth becoming Avis Preferred so you can have a car ready and assigned to you when you arrived.  \\n\\nMy party got off the shuttle, walked to the board to see where our car was, found the car and checked out when we left the lot.  Piece of cake and only took a couple minutes.",
        "Hotel rooms are pretty gross. Carpets are so dirty that our feet got black. When we first checked in, there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows. GROSS. I guess you can say that you get what you pay for.. Cheap hotel. At least there was a mini fridge.\\n\\nBuffet was awesome though!",
        "Checked this place out while on vacation.  The appetizers were dish! We had the wings with the citrus habanero sauce. Right amount of sweet & spice.  Then we had the pork belly & tomato jam.  AMAZING!! Ordered tacos but I was too stuffed to eat them!  Would totally go back and just do the apps!",
        "Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news.",
        "I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point.",
        "Went there to play a $5 free slot play coupon through Total Rewards, that I got when I checked in at the Rio. They told me that I had already claimed the free slot play coupon , (I had it in my hand?) I asked them to show me ANY points I accumulated  at that casino, they couldn't because I didn't put 1 dollar in any slot machines. Place is a dump",
        "The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show \\\"Man Vs Food\\\" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. \\nReasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer.",
        "Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad.",
        "Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!",
        "Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service.",
        "I just moved to Vegas and looking to purchase a home.  I was assured that it will not be a problem even though I was told by the other brokerage firm that I need a full time position in Vegas for at least a month before I can qualify for a home when I checked into it last year.  They assured us that it was not a problem.  I didn't want another hard credit ding on my credit score.  I got a hard ding with no loan.",
        "When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \\\"certified technicians\\\" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else.",
        "I shop at Petsmart for cat food for the queen of our household.  Since I was doing other shopping at the plaza, I went here.\\n\\nThe stores are pretty much laid out the same.  I found what I wanted quickly, checked out very quickly, and I was on my way.\\n\\nThe cashier was friendly and efficient.  A good stop for the queen's food!",
        "Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.",
        "The greatest sandwich I have ever had my entire life. The owner is super nice and every person that works there treats you like a human being and not just a sale. Chris was so nice when he gave me my food and checked on me and asked how my food was. I plan on trying everything on the menu. The pesto sandwich was amazing. Chris recommended to chipotle next. I Know Where I'm GOING tomorrow!",
        "Checked into our room and went with kids to the pool. The hot tub had black water in it. No kidding. You couldn't see the bottom of the tub. The water smelled disgusting like smelly feet. How can staff not know what is going on in their hotel!  We won't be back.",
        "People there were all unfriendly\\nFood was undercooked and served cold\\nWaitress was rude\\nPancakes tasted like bleach\\nWater tasted like sewer water\\nWe never got any drink refills\\nTable was dirty when we sat down and we asked if it could be wiped off. It never was\\nDo not waste your money on this place",
        "The food is great but I have problems every time I go to this location.  Service is very poor. I will not be going to this location any longer I leave upset every time. . .",
        "The cookies are pretty here. I like to come here and make pretend I was in the mood for something else so I can act surprised because the sandwiches are so yummy!"

        "The place was clean and bright. The portions/burgers were small but OK. My buddy had the Chicken Parmesan burger and though it was small - he raved about it. Specifically the sauce. The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \\\"Colorado cigarettes\\\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.",
        "Jim Barker, Debbie Wilson and Ashley Ford.  Avoid!  My loan went pass the date and the sellers are pissed and put in a 3 day cure notice.  Now they are asking for items that they should of asked for weeks ago.  I don't think they even open the Email that I sent them, unprofessional and I will probably lose this house and money because of there mistakes.  Process was the worst, thank God we got the house",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.",
        "I used to eat here regularly, but a poor customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. So congratulations Napoli, a long time, regular customer is gone.",
        "Awful sushi! Not friendly at all. The waitress had such a bad attitude. Never again. Not even for free!!!!!!",
        "The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though.",
        "Went to Ventanos because a friend recommended it and we loved it! The wine was excellent, the bread had a good flavor, the food was delicious, and the view was amazing! I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too.",
        "Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service",
        "Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game.",
        "this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.",
        "Love the personal training sessions, classes and the friendly ambiance! Best way to get fit instead of a regular gym! Always leave here sweating and stronger!",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \\n\\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \\n\\nThe music, however, was cool.",
        "JULY 29, 2011 == noticed  the restaurant's  sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here!",
        "Had the BBQ Burger for lunch. Too much lettuce tomato and 'fixings' to steal the taste of the burger away. \\n\\nLet the meat be the star of the burgers, not lettuce.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \\n\\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance.",
        "You want a fantastic breakfast with a southwestern twist?  You found it.\\n\\nMy favorites are the enchiladas and eggs with pork green chili. Or the green chili meatloaf and eggs.  Or the tenderloin benedict with jalapeno hollandaise!  It's really just hard to go wrong here.\\n\\nA bit tricky to find as there is no sign but take the time and hunt it down I promise you'll love it!",
        "I gave this sushi place a try, since it's around Summerlin(where I live). It was a to-go order. The sushi were not well made. They rolls don't look presentable. One of the rolls I got is a salmon roll. To my surprise, the salmon is cooked not fresh.",
        "We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!",
        "Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. \\n\\nI am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.",
        "Sushi was just okay.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Unexciting, bland and expensive! \\nService was good, if somewhat snobbish. \\nFood was nothing special run of the mill bland Italian fair.\\n\\nAll in all its probably not worth it. Especially for someone like myself who is really not Italian fan. \\n\\n\\\"I no like\\\"\\n\\nEugene",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.  \\n\\nLove the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.\\n\\nI could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do.",
        "Best croissance that's all u gotta say.....",
        "Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!",
        "I have been going to Bear Kneads for over a year and have worked with both Chris and Dave. They are professional and very knowledgable guys. \\n\\nI play sports and have gone to Bear Kneads for sports related injuries as well as for relaxation. Their skill level compared to other places in Charlotte is second to none, especially considering how reasonable their rates are!\\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend Bear Kneads!",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "Full service hair salon with tanning beds.   They do everything from the basic cut to color, highlights, brazilian blowouts, extentions, hair replacement and wigs.  Always offer coffe/tea or water while i am waiting for my highlights to set.  No pressure for a rebook.  Check it out!!",
        "They now have vegetarian fajitas, $10, not a bad price but you don't get much tofu at all and the ones at Jack Astor's are better in every way.\\n\\nOver all they're not bad, but I don't think I'd order them again.",
        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",
        "Went through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich. Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems. I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough. Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe.",
        "First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom.",
        "meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner.",
        "I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.",
        "The view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing. I only give it 3 stars because I didn't think the food measured up to the price. however, I think what you're paying for is the experience. I'm glad I went once, but I probably wouldn't go back.",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",
        "The moules frites is the best  hands down. Great ambiance.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "A decent sandwich for a decent price. Not the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  Everything is \\u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to get here JUST for a sandwich, but if you are nearby it probably won't disappoint",
        "Love this place! Great sushi and Korean. Although I mostly go for the sushi",
        "My guy is probably going to be upset that I'm dissing the Great Steak, but it was not my pick. I'm okay with compromising when he's that excited about it though. \\n\\nHe really wanted a Great Steak, which is technically a cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato. We just ordered one to split. I wasn't as excited about it as he was, but that's life.",
        "My son went and got us subs for dinner last night.   I had the JJBLT.   Not good.   The bacon had an odd taste, and, despite my request for \\\"Crispy\\\", it was soggy.   I ended up eating a lettuce, mayo and tomato sandwich.  Disappointing consumption of calories.",
        "Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back.",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "As far as college students go, this is the place to be for birthdays and pregaming. For birthdays, you get all-you-can-drink free beer, mug, a tiny sundae and a balloon. My friends and I all love the cheese curds with gritty sauce and the gritty burgers. Power hour (every night from 10-11pm) has $1 mixers and is the best bar to begin drinking at.",
        "The lobster fajitas were amazing! $26. After reading the reviews about the service I was hesitant to try this place but our waiter Fab was awesome!  I'll be back to order the same & ask for Fab",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "Service was great and the owners are nice. We got 6 donuts consisting of maple bars, the apple crumble, jelly, and glazed. They were reasonably priced and pretty good. I have them four stars because they are good, but not as good as Bosa. I would rank them also slightly worse than Krispy kremes",
        "Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.",
        "The end is near. Went for one last hurrah before closing.  Love westroc and their products but the thrill is gone from tv.",
        "$18 bucks w/ tax for all you can eat sushi/bbq/whatever.\\n\\nMy favorites - sake sushi, orange chicken, lo mein, and the fried sesame rice balls.\\n\\nFor all-you-can eat, it has a good price and food that actually tastes decent.  That's tough to beat.",
        "One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.\\n\\nI went with the kitchen sink combo.  The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!",
        "Great vibe and location for we S. Phx folk, but ye gods, beware ordering a \\\"house Cabernet\\\" during Happy Hour - $12 a GLASS!  For happy hour house wine?  Are you kidding?  \\n\\nThe hhr food is a great deal, we'll be ordering beer next time.. phew.  \\n\\nCaveat emptor.  Bring a high limit credit card.",
        "Everything is so good!!\\n\\nEspecially, Kushi and beef tongues.\\n\\nI love this place.\\n\\nYou should come here!!!\\n\\n^o^",
        "I actually love everything about this place except one critical problem. The buns are probably the worst buns I know of anywhere. They are horrible, and they fall apart. I took the time to write the company, no response. I can walk there, love everything else, but cant go for a burger. sad",
        "This place sucks!! Staff was rude. Rooms look like army barracks. We came for the ambiance and hospitality but were greeted with terrible service and poor attitudes!!\\n\\nWould not recommend!",
        "Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison.",
        "Great Breakfast food...expecially the skillets.\\nConsistent style and portions...I really like the chicken, bacon, avocado skillet. However, I'm not a big fan of the coffee...i think it's quite bitter. but they have fresh squezzed O.J....and great whole grain pancakes.",
        "A healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza! The dumplings are homemade and are very soft. I had the carrot + beef dumplings and they were quite delicious. The congee is fairly cheap at 2$ a bowl so whenever I have spare change, I stop by and grab one. Give the place a try!",
        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",
        "I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill slightly over the years. More globbed on sauces and general blandness. Meh.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "Franz\\u00f6sische T\\u00f6rtchen und guter Kaffee: das suche ich einem Kaffee. \\nHier im Ludwig ist die Qualit\\u00e4t erstklassig, der Service gut, aber nicht der aufmerksamste. \\nDer Preise sind f\\u00fcr die innerstadt von KA in Ordnung.",
        "A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it.",
        "Love this Jamba Juice.  The bo-go coupons come through so often that it makes it tough to go there without one.  I have to modify my order to make it dairy.  Pet peeve- it's \\\"sherbet\\\", not \\\"sher-beRt\\\".  There is no second \\\"r\\\".  If you're in the smoothie biz, please say it right.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "I thought the food was pretty good. I have done alot of really good Tapas and this was just pretty good. These guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is. Too busy for me on the weekends I would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it won't be soon.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.",
        "Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts.",
        "Maybe I'm too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of H street in San Diego... Nothing comes even remotely close to it. Overall food was ok; priced just right. I say try it you'll probably like it!",
        "Excellent food and service.  Love this place!   We had the enchiladas with steak    The guacamole was yummy too.  This is now my favorite Mexican resturant!!!",
        "Probably not the cleanest place in town, but not unbearably dirty either. The food, however, is great. The bacon cheeseburger I ordered was excellent. The \\\"regular\\\" order of fries was very generous and among the best fries I've ever had. \\n\\nAnd the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.",
        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",
        "Great food and good pricing. The sushi is great and I've never gotten fishy or old sushi here! Great for kids, just wish they had the children's chopsticks available. Good atmosphere and outside dining with lake view available.",

        "This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.",
        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good.

I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",

I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.

I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction.",

The sand artist was really cool and different.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",

Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\\n\\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\\n\\nI would go back, but with low expectations.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",

Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",
        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.

Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.",

I wasn't as excited about it as he was, but that's life.",

So glad I found it!",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",

Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",

        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",
        "Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.",
        "Ordered chicken fingers and fries on special for $5.95. The chicken fingers were the kind of chicken you find in a $1 McDonald's chicken sandwich. The fries were completely tasteless. No salt. For the price, Jack in the Box or Farm Basket is much much better. Will not eat here again.",
        "One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.\\n\\nI went with the kitchen sink combo.

There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",
        "This cafe was so good. The raw pizzas and burgers were excellent.  They also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes. The Cookies and Cream' shake was my favorite.  I strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the Vegas area.",

But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. \\n\\nToo much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back..",

        "The chips are fresh, so is the salsa, the food was just okay,  nothing that I would run back to! But the shrimp ceviche and the margaritas definitely would have me running back only during happy hour!\\nThe service was A1, everyone was very nice and friendly, especially my waiter Claudio!",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere.",

        "There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas.",

        "Probably not the cleanest place in town, but not unbearably dirty either. The food, however, is great. The bacon cheeseburger I ordered was excellent. The \\\"regular\\\" order of fries was very generous and among the best fries I've ever had. \\n\\nAnd the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch.",

Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",

        "Great subs! I've been going here for years... they cut the meat right in front of you, give you generouis amounts, bread is fresh, and staff is always pretty friendly. It is MUCH better than any subway or quizno's I've been to. Get your subs fully loaded, it is DELICIOUS.",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "Yes as good as it gets! Fantastico! Fabuloso!",
        "The shower drain was clogged....The rooms aren't that great, but if you're a poor college student or poor postgrad...then it's not that bad.  Great location.",
        "We had lunch here on a Monday. The place was not busy at all. The food was far from spectacular. We used points from the players card to pay for our buffet. Thank goodness because the  food was horrendous. I would never pay for this buffet with my own money. The service was great other than that this buffet just like the establishment its built-in,is on a downward spiral into.the toilet.",
        "Every Indian in Las Vegas eats here. If you're not Indian and you want to eat where the Indians eat, this is it. It's the Bomb. and I don't mean Bay.\\n\\nEveryplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie Slumdog compared to this.",
        "Gross is the first word that comes to mind.  The ladies room was covered in piss and toilet tissue. If that's not indication enough of how classy that place is maybe the soft porn or rude crowd that will push u to get a mini beer for a nickle would be. Really weird vibe there too. I'll pass and go next door and pay the 4 extra dollars for a full sized beer that I don't have to wait in line for.",
        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "I think Korina might have mixed this place up with somewhere else - or perhaps has an ex-boyfriend working there... \\n\\nCommunity Tire is one of the most professional companies I have ever done business with, and they definitely stand behind their work 100%.\\n\\nI have used two of the Community Tire locations and had nothing but perfect results. Fast, fair, friendly! Plus, they give back a lot to the local community.",
        "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.",
        "Dr. Griffith is great. I've been to other vets who don't even care about animals. She is great with them. My large dog was feeling defensive and she knew how to make her feel comfortable and was patient during the whole visit. This will be the new place we take our dogs, and the fact that it's the cheapest in town is the cherry on top. Quick in and quick out too. No long waits. I'm happy!",
        "Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.\\nrest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .\\nWeekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.\\nbut weekdays pretty slow.\\nIf you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Love's has everything you could possibly need on a road trip.  Cheap gas, tons of drink choices, a bunch of options for grub!  I knocked down the stars a bit for this particular location because the bathroom was not that clean compared to some spotless Love's bathrooms I have seen in the past.",
        "Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it....\\\"I need to go to the bathroom...Hula's bathroom\\\". That's the restaurant across the street.\\n\\nBest laugh I had all night",
        "This is where I usually go when visiting downtown. The atmosphere is great. I think its what makes this place. Its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls. There is also a dance floor and dj in the back. Last time I got a pretty rude bartender though. Only negative thing I have to say.",
        "The Starbucks inside the bookstore is own and operated by the bookstore and not by Starbucks, so any of your Starbucks GC will not be accepted there.  That was a bummed thing to hear.  Overall, the bookstore is pretty clean, bathroom is very clean too, at least that's what I saw when I visited them.  Location can be better as you can't see it from the main road.",

There only secret is truffle not used properly. \\n\\nIt is gorgeous inside and the service is great but if you are going to spend 300$ on food and saki you shouldn't leave hungry and disappointed.",
        "Really good fried catfish!  I was not really fond of catfish until I tried Jamburrito's way of serving it. The jambalaya rice makes the perfect accompaniment for the crunchy delight. The people serving the food are very friendly and the total experience definitely makes Food Truck Fridays a weekly event to look forward to.",
        "Been going to Deb for 13 years. She's the best (and funniest) manicurist in town. I love her and wouldn't go anywhere else!! I highly recommend her - and she's great at both blingy nails and the plain nails I usually like.",
        "I dig this place. They give you a decent sized salad and these dangerous fried chips with a sweet sauce I pretty much drown anything I order in. The prices are great and they give you a decent amount of food. I don't go for the atmosphere because there really isn't one but the prices are cheap the food is good and the service is quick. They get a thumbs up.",
        "Yes, its pricey but so worth every bit of it.  \\nrack of lamb is amazing.  never do I eat lamb but I have the last four times I went.  \\nFabulous martinis and great oyster selections.  Be sure to tell them no pepper on the Oysters...why they do that, who knows but they do.  Good oysters need no spices.\\nIts really not a place for children but my 5 year old enjoyed it.",
        "They take reservations so you can come in at your scheduled time to hand you a hostess wait wand.  Waiting area smells of dirty people and a spilled dip bottle.  Bar smells like old spilled drinks.  They only received 2 stars because of house made pasta, but I'm felling a bit nervous to eat here because of the smell.",
        "I wrote a review for the JJ on Bell and gave it 4 stars.  A reason for this one at 3.  Same service and good employees.  However the sandwich seem shorted and less delicious.  Lacked on the sprouts and sauce, two necessary plentifulls in my book.  Since I work in the area I will of course revisit.",
        "Poor access from monorail. Poor restaurant qualities and diversity. Poor lobby (only twos gents working at front desk with loads of people in line). Poor bell desk (took 30 mins to get to my room to give me new access cards to give to me to change my room...since the room next to me was noisy with partygoers). Old dirty carpeting. Basic bathroom. Avoid this hotel. Stay at MGM",
        "Ever walked into an old establishment and feel like you leave needing  shower...welcome to Dona Maria. It's plain damp feeling and just unpleasant. The food was OK but being  regular lunch eater in the downtown area I'm glad I waited so long to try this place and it will be a long time before I try it again. Sorry!!!",
        "Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly",
        "Finally found a great Vegas hotel that suits our family need - It's very spacious, comfortable, nice Jacuzzi, great indoor/outdoor pool, non-smoking, and Quiet at night. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of some casinos, but it provided true comfort and luxury. If I have to complain about something, their food selection is very limited. We go out to stripe for food.",
        "This is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. It is probably five stars during the slowest hours. I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends.  The laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited. They do have change machines that work well.",
        "I miss Dim Sum. New Orleans is not a place to live if it's a staple in your diet. I loved the hustle and bustle of Asian familes and the harried staff. The dumplings themselves were good, the tea piping hot, but wished we had ordered some broccoli.\\n\\nThat is all.",
        "It's gets the job done. The \\\"Deluxe\\\" bit might be a bit of a stretch as the facility appears to have had better days. This will never be confused with a main stream or premium range hotel but I am not sure anyone would be surprised by that. I would not stay here with the family for a vacation but for a bed and a shower while working out of town it suffices.",
        "i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it",
        "I've been here many times because its close to where I Live.\\nThe menu is stale and the same old thing.\\nThe food is pretty good (nothing special)\\nBut is definitely overpriced.\\nGood luck",
        "This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\\n\\nI've always had good service here.",
        "Consistently the best customer service around. Needed new rear tire a while back. No up sells, just options for my budget and needs. Today in for a flat repair. No waiting to talk to someone - they meet and greet you immediately. Both times I've been quoted accurate wait time which is a huge deal to me. Knowledgeable, friendly, courteous staff- I highly recommend this location to everyone in the area.",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "fun music and vacation atmosphere in the heat of tempe summer...\\n\\nbut we won't be back. \\n\\nmargaritas were so salty, beers were watery, and food was too spicy - the kind of spicy that drowns out the flavor (and this is coming from a Thai-Hot kinda girl).  \\n\\nFood/drinks are reasonable, but it was a total waste of money.",
        "Worst bar I've ever been to. I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer. The bartenders are rude, the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude. Also,  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there. No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet. Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.",
        "We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!",
        "We ordered it for delievery with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com.  It's resonably priced and very yummy.  We'll order again.  I can't comment on the actual location though because again we ordered delievery.  I had the hot and sour soup and it was delicous, we also ordered some sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and chicken chow main it was all good!",
        "I admit my spouse is a bigger fan, but the food is fresh and authentic in style. We go often as the lighter fare is a nice break from traditional american cuisine.\\n\\nThey regularly have coupons in the val packs which arrive in the mail monthly making a full meal out hard to resist.",
        "If you are looking for a wonderful way to \\\"board\\\" your pet while you are away, I highly recommend Doolittle's Doghouse!  Your pet will stay in the home of a carefully selected \\\"nannie\\\" who will provide loving care while you are gone.  (No more cages and dog runs!)  As a veterinarian, I make recommendations very carefully and I highly recommend this service to my friends, family and clients!",
        "Go to the real thing in LA.\\n\\nBut, if you do make it to this show, you'll find the crowd fun, the host smarmy, the \\\"Barker's beauties\\\" disinterested, and the prizes a bit shabby. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the $50 show, screamed my brains out over dinette sets, conair curlers, and plinko chips.",
        "I like this place,  but the bathrooms are disgusting. There is never toilet paper, they were out of soap last time and  they had no paper towels to dry hands. Other than that, the little cafe is pretty decent and the drinks are cheap.  Good times can be had.",
        "Hello friends,\\n\\nIt's McDonalds!!! 24hr. I can't validate any other reviews. Everyone seems on point when I come here. But that just may be my great smile and personality. Who knows.\\n \\nBut it serves its purpose.\\n\\nFree Wi-Fi\\n\\nTTFN",

        "First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes... \\n\\n\\nSay no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids.",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",

Have a glass of wine of the out Door patio at mix lounge. Stunning views and beautiful atmosphere. Yeah the food is pricey and small but very thoughtful and delicious. If you find go for dinner just go for a drink. On a side note the bathroom with the toilet facing the strip is pretty awesome!",
        "Saturday night. Looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm. Show started near 930. So freaking crowded you can't see the band.  Its so loud you cant hear the band.  Fire Marshall bill would close the place. So over capacity you can't move. Let alone get to the bathroom. All about greed. Need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move.",
        "We just checked into this hotel, and it's beautiful!  The front desk staff were so nice and friendly.  We're staying in an Executive Suite, so we expect niceness, but it's more than expected.  When we entered our room, our fireplace was already turned on for us - so was the music.  I'm going to enjoy staying here so much---I'm so spoiled!!!",

        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "This is a convenient place to meet and eat. I had a business meeting over lunch which worked out well since the restaurant seems to drown out some of the casino noise and the ambient music. I had the chicken quesadilla which tasted good except for the guacamole which was horrible. The portion was a tad on the small side but it is considered an appetizer and reasonably priced.",
        "Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.  \\n\\nI would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again.",
        "I don't even want people to know about this place because I'll have to wait longer, but wowzers, amazing flavors.  The sides (or three) are the real stars here.  The fried brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were my favs.  The brisket was a little chewier than I'd like.  One of your sides can be these little dessert cups.  Delicious!",
        "Awesome bulgogi tacos! Chef didn't have Kim chi so he whipped up some Asian slaw for my friend. I had the New Mexico burger w/garlic fries, which were delicious! Brought home a pastrami sandwich w/garlic fries for the hubby. They must have been good because the only crumbs left were the ones on his shirt! Will definitely be back!",

        "We took our one year old dog, Owen, in for neutering.  The staff was wonderful!  The surgery went so well- very impressive.  I would highly recommend this vet- we have been in the area for over 25 years- tried many vets and this is the best without overcharging you.",
        "If I had 30 dollars left and I had a choice of buying a pizza pie or going to marquee, I would choose the pizza life everyday. Shoutout to the grandmas out there. \\n\\nThis place is spot for a pricey oily slice of indulgent vegas goodness.",

        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",

        "This place blows.  Staff doesn't have a clue about customer service, (except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio).  Food was blah.  Spring rolls with out Thai basil, seriously?

        "The food is absolutely terrible at this Qdoba, or maybe it is all Qdoba's I don't know.  Either way, Qdoba does not stack up to Chipotle.  Better than Someburros?  Nope.  Better than Filliberto's?  Not quite.  Better than Taco Bell?  Doubtful.  Better than a Hot Pocket?  Yes, but what isn't?",
        "Went for lunch and the service was not impressive considering we were the only two people in the place. They do serve Boar's Head meats so the sandwiches we ordered were delicious.\\n\\nIt looks like they do a brisk business on pastries and cakes. They look delicious but didn't try any this trip.",
        "Had breakfast here the other day with the fam, great selection and to my delight, many items had a Greek twist to them.  On top of the food being tasty, you can easily share with a spouse, friend, relative or foe as the portions are huge!  I will definitely be back soon with friends.",
        "This is a great sub place if you like subs made with pre-sliced, bucketed meat on crumbly, stale bread that disintegrates when touched by vinegar or tomatoes, or just by taking a bite.  In a word: DISGUSTING.  Good service, though, can't complain about that.  Sadly, that's not enough for me to give this place more than one star (although it really deserves zero).",
        "Horrible worst service I've ever had. Slow no check backs no refills asked for one it never came. Poured water with glasses on the table splashing ever where. Watched an employee use the bathroom and then not wash hands. Food was great but can't say I'll be back.",
        "Looks way nicer on the outside. The room I was in was very dark and there was very little ventilation in the bedroom and none what so ever in the bathroom. Also what was very frustrating was that after 12am it seemed like there was nowhere to get anything to eat. And the one place I did find that was 24hrs had run out of pretty much everything. Wouldn't stay there again. Maybe just to visit the pool for the day but that is it.",
        "Things have gone downhill since the early reviews of this property.  The elevator has numerous scuff marks, dings and lots of wear and tear marks.  The welcome mats in the lobby are dirty.  Our room had several suspicious stains on the black out curtain and bathroom wall.  The supposedly non-smoking floor was smoky as is the common areas.  The staff are friendly, which saved the resort from a 2 star rating.",

        "Magpie is a great little Pizzeria located on MaGuire just above fairmount\\n\\nTo begin their MagPie Bloody Caesar is amazing\\nI started with their meatballs and Caesar Salad, again both were really good\\n\\nTheir Pizzas are HUGE 1 is enough for 2 people, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, I had Prosciutto it was delicious\\n\\nPrices are reasonable but space is limited so get there early or make reservations",
        "After posting this, I went in and asked for a cash refund, as I was not interested in returning and would not use a credit.  As mentioned by the owner, I was given the cash refund I requested.  I stand by all my other statements.",
        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",
        "I went here yesterday and ate at Dillion's BBQ, I had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect. The manager was great with me, and I will defiantly be back",
        "Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website.",
        "we've heard a lot about this place, and finally went there, and it kind of sucked. hardly any sauces, and it's totally ugly inside. also, i'm not sure if the girl working at the front is even old enough to avoid child labor laws.\\n\\ntheir pineapple was bad.\\n\\nlai lai is way better, and so is genghis grill. avoid this place.",
        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",
        "We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful",
        "As a follow up to my previous review - the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue.  I appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience I had.",
        "One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.",
        "Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.",
        "Went for the \\\"garlic festival\\\".  Love this place but where was the garlic festival?  They were selling some garlic but that was it.  Very disappointing. I will continue to buy their oils and spreads but won't bother to attend anymore \\\"festivals\\\".",
        "Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.",
        "They do have just about any kind or type of battery. My issue is with the website. After looking up the battery you need, then you select the store nearest you and check stock. Then you arrive there to purchase the battery and they tell you they DO NOT HONOR THE INTERNET PRICES. When the internet site directs you to a store they should honor the price.",
        "I really like Millers but this place is horrible at transitioning from the early to afternoon games on Sundays. The \\\"it'll be on these tv's after these games are over\\\" excuse is unacceptable. All the tv's are showing the same games!!!!  You're telling me with your high tech audio room you can't change some channels? It's either lazy or incompetent.",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "Horrible bank! Rude and unhelpful!",
        "I was suprised how much I liked Kahunaville. Sandwiches are all very reasonably priced- around 11 bucks- and very large. The drinks are spendy like most of Vegas but be nice and they pour stiff. I highly recommend a Bombay and tonic yard. \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and professional, She did a great job especially since one of my group pulled a rude dipshit maneuver with an empty ketchup bottle.",
        "Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip.",
        "I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere",
        "Staff was rude and pizza stunk!!!!",
        "Really, really heavy food.  I like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals.  An experience, undoubtably, but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals.  A salad on the menu would be nice.\\n\\nThat said, the service was spectacularly good.",
        "Dr. Weiner is awesome! He put me at ease about my surgery and now I'm able to breathe through my nose. He is very knowledgable and explained everything in terms I could follow. The office staff at this location  on the other hand is not very friendly. They were as helpful as people at the DMV! I would suggest going to one if the other locations!",
        "I attended a meeting at Caesars in May.  I had been to Caesars many, many times, but have never stayed at the hotel.  They put us up in the Octavius Tower...very nice!  Big rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms and great views!",
        "My friend and I went here in the late afternoon for a drink or two and a meal. We found the selection to be great but the service and food were lackluster. \\n\\nWe wanted to give this place a fair shot after hearing so many mixed reviews but it took several minutes before we had a staff member even acknowledge us. \\n\\nThis bottleshop could be a great hangout for group and friends a like but it's anything but.",
        "Fantastic! Excellent workout, super nice friendly staff. Been going for about 6 weeks. Each instructor is terrific. Selling the treadmill!",
        "Room Cleanliness D-\\nValet Parking C-\\nResort Charge F\\nBathroom Cleanliness D-\\nLocation B-\\nFront Desk C\\n\\nOverall this hotel was built in 1989, the updates that they have attempted to do are done in poor quality and taste. Unfortunately I rank this place a D+ overall.",
        "Oh this place is good!\\nTheir portions are more than enough, and everything tastes so home made!\\n\\nIts open late! Im not sure how late, but its open late, and this is my go to place after I get out of class and want to grab some good asian cuisine.",
        "Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \\\"afterparty\\\" but I would rather stick to the main clubs.",
        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",
        "I won't stay here again! The first room air did not work, switched to another room the next day & that air didn't work! Staff is friendly but did nothing in the way of upgrading our room. I will stay at Paris because they always make my stay a pleasant experience. BTW no WI-FI unless we left the room to go to Starbucks!",
        "While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "First off, I was annoyed for waiting over half an hour for waffles, it wasn't over crowded so that was just lame. This place is over hyped, nothing special. Just a bunch of different toppings on waffles. Big whoop! The food isn't bad it's just not anything special.",
        "Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure.",
        "Pretty bummed, this place was awesome, I didn't have an issue with service when I went.  Food was out of this world delicious.  Not many gluten free and vegan places around, a loss.",
        "I am not one for a college bar hangout.  I have been brought here several times and I have to say that those several times have been lackluster.\\n\\nThe food was good bar fare with giant portions.  I haven't tried the oysters yet. Soon.\\n\\nMy rec is go here for a late 2 martini lunch.",
        "Large airport... it's international after all, but my god it's a lot of walking. Needs more moving sidewalks ala Bellagio / Caesars / Luxor / MGM style. lol. \\n\\ncould also use a facelift, it's rather lackluster in appearance, inside and out. this IS Vegas, right??",
        "Just wanted to update. Manager contacted us. Was willing to give full refund or have the top installed for free. Seems there was a communication issue. Issue was resolved, even kept the truck box cover. Did have an issue, but company did resolve in a timely manner and apologized for the miscommunication",
        "I'm not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews, but this is above average in terms of food.  However, the atmosphere is lacking in comparision.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall.  If you want something different than a chain, you may want to consider it.",
        "I will not return to this burger king Ever! Being new you would think they would have a higher standard. The forgot the fries with the meal order. When the fries did come they tasted like they were cooked the day before, luke warm  stale and card board texture! The two sandwiches I ordered were not much better, they tasted as if they cam from a am pm connivence store! Very disappointed with this location. I wont be back!",
        "Hands down the best prime rib available, if the old saying is true you get what you pay for than this is quality at its finest, pricing is fair, about a hundred dollars for two with drinks, and they even bring the carving station to your table while the chef cuts the meat to your liking, all out great service.",
        "Beer wasn't great and the menu was pretty lame... I expected a much better menu. Very disapointing. Gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison... I won't be back.",
        "Took my girlfriend here sometime in 07' when we went and was referred by the concierge at the hotel.  We made a reservations so we were sat down immediately when we arrived.  The service was good and the food was even better, we greatly enjoyed it and for seafood I would say this is one of the better places to go in Vegas.  It was a little pricey (w/ tip $150) but when in Vegas, $ should never be an issue...",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business.",
        "Great transaction. Ladies are wonderful and gives you awesome advices.  Validated my parking stub too. Tip: we found place easily by reading other comments on here. Rates are awesome and worth the trip.",
        "Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\\n\\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\\n\\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall.",
        "We ordered it for delievery with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com.  It's resonably priced and very yummy.  We'll order again.  I can't comment on the actual location though because again we ordered delievery.  I had the hot and sour soup and it was delicous, we also ordered some sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and chicken chow main it was all good!",
        "I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls.",
        "Best misoyaki butterfish I ever had!  The sake, which I cant remember the name was also great.  I don't know why I have less of an issue dropping some $$$ on high end Japanese food than high end Chinese food.  Hmmmm....",
        "Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \\n\\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down.",
        "Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food.",
        "Get some late night dessert here and receive free entry to the club. The desserts here are so pretty, that you'll have to take a picture before you take a bite. Too bad the dessert doesn't make up for the lame club there have here afterwards. The music is wack and I just can't dance to wack music.",
        "First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes... \\n\\n\\nSay no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids.",
        "my best friends girlfriend came for a visit from austin, being an architecture major, this was a place we obviously had to go.\\n\\nbeing there was obviously amazing... here's my beef... a tour was between $30-$80, seriously.  there was no way we could afford this obnoxious fee so we walked around the house and checked out the gift shop. we were pleased with this, but pretty disappointed not to take the tour.",
        "I have no complaints, other than the prices are higher than other places. The location is convenient and the cashiers are always friendly.  I was reading other reviews about the cleanliness of the store, and it's strange because I've lived here a month now and haven't had any of those experiences.",
        "This place is clean!  I love that.  \\n\\nThe techs have all been really sweet.  They call the next day to make sure your visit went well.  (The people running the front desk need to work on their delivery.  They come across as a little disinterested and irritated.)  \\n\\nThey're a little expensive, but you can't put a price on cleanliness and safety!",
        "Howard the owner can be rude and unwelcoming. The rest of the staff are great.",
        "Great burgers, waffle fries, and quick service. Much better then I expected and they have a good dinner menu and late nite burger menu also. \\n\\nPlus you can play keno at your table!!!",
        "Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience.",
        "Great club/Lounge. Excellent service and bottle service is a must. The view in the patio is also wonderful. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their excellenct customer service and friendliness.",
        "Cupcakes and cake bites are great, though the red velvet needs some work. While not a selling point for me, they have milk on tap to wash the goodies down.",
        "$4 Value Slam gets 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. Perfect balance. Good food A+ service. Keeps me away from cooking at home. Winning.",
        "I decided to give this place another try. It was a mistake. They were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case. Service was average. My friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned.",
        "Not a fan. Do not go to Casino Royale in Vegas. This is a sham! They will promise you game play and it is impossible to make it happen under their guidelines. Then, they will simply apologize and tell you there is nothing more they can do for you. The best part is you have to run a $20 through their machines first and get or to a zero balance before their $20 will kick in...",
        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",
        "I purchased a Groupon for an oil change but after upgrading to Synthetic oil I ended paying $94 in top of the $15.00 for the original oil change. Honesty? I didn't get it at this location. No Savings at all, you will be scam is no way out. You will see it. Also they give a price $239 for rear brakes pad but they did not get me here, I got it done for $89.00.",
        "They seem to be in the middle of a transition, changing the menu to add special entrees and such.\\nThe manager was walking around tonight offering patrons random FULL entrees for free, just to try ! That type of atmosphere is what will guarantee my return - goodonya GG.",
        "This gyms okay, lots of machines friendly staff, parking isn't a big issue but it tends to get packed.... Most likely because it's the new year. You can't go wrong with there pricing. I guess if your gonna work out go really early in the morning or late at night",
        "Fun place and 5$ dollar pitchers during he week. Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls.",
        "Conveniently located at the entrance of the Mirage, its a great location for grabbing a quick beer.   My only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucks...yikes!",
        "In my search for great BBQ this place stands out.  Not only is it tasty but it doesn't irritate my stomach.  That is a major plus in my book.  The one drawback is service.  I've ordered online and arrived at the specified pick up time 30-60 minutes later to still have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  So be advised to just go to the take out counter and order, as it will take just as long.",
        "Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \\nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue.

Would definately go back.",

I like Pad Thai with a light sauciness, not graviness.\\n\\nAs a rule sauciness is much more appealing than graviness.  I'll generally take sauciness over sassyness as well.  And rudeness.  Definitely sauciness over rudeness.",

        "The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore.",
        "Not long after posting my review, I was contacted by their Director of Marketing & Community Relations apologizing for my less than excellent experience. She was incredibly sweet and accommodating. My gripes about my experience there still stand, but I commend them for taking my criticisms and addressing them with me in an appropriate and appreciative manner. Hopefully, they'll still take my to-go cup gripe to heart.",

        "I really like this airport. They have done a great job remodeling and upgrading it. It's nice and clean. The tram system is very smooth easy to use. Lots of shops and bathrooms. Plenty of restaurants and bars to relax in. They also have a few enclosed smoking areas if you have to smoke.",
        "Quite simply THE place in the metro Phoenix area for beer lovers.  The Pizza and sandwiches are great and the food in general is definitely high quality and well thought out, but it is the 30 constantly rotating beers on tap that bring the craft beer nerds from miles around.  \\n\\nSeems more crowded on Friday and Saturday nights but otherwise not too busy.  Unfortunately they do not open until like 2pm so don't drive all the way over there for a quick lunch.",
        "These guys fixed my 50+ year old money clip that belonged to my great-grandpa and made it sturdier than ever! The price I paid was lower than the price I was quoted too. I will absolutely return here with my watch and jewelry repair needs.",
        "I eat here at least once a week.  It is delicious, and cheap.  You can't beat a lunch for under $5.  The spring rolls and the #12 beef pho are good if you're looking for a basic meal.  The cafe sua da is delicious, but you have to be patient for the coffee to drip down.  If you're looking to test your manliness, challenge yourself with #54."

VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "BRUNCH: Went there for brunch once and it was eeally OK. We couldn't even get a clean glass of water. Imagine! And the food was good but nothing \\\"woah\\\" about it.

        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",

The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!",

When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",

Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",

Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",

I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",

So glad I found it!",

        "Service was great and the owners are nice. We got 6 donuts consisting of maple bars, the apple crumble, jelly, and glazed. They were reasonably priced and pretty good.

        "I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.",

I do break out with threading but like 95% less than waxing.\\n\\nI like coming to this location because they are never busy around lunch time so I can get in and out and do some shopping around Town Square.  I have been telling everyone about threading since I discovered it.  Totally worth the little extra time!",
        "I have been bringing my pet here for 10 years.They know me and my dog by name. They have always taken time to answer even the silliest questions I have. I cannot even begin to calculate the amount of money the wellness plan saves me for healthcare for my dog. They have a caring staff and provide great quality care. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else",

It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",

        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",

        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2.

        "very disappionted in customer service. i have shopped in this store for over ten years and feel like i have been treated less than appropriately on sveral occasions.  taking care of their long standing customers in difinitely  not a priority!!! very disappionting.",

        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back.",
        "Has both breakfast and dinner here. Fair range of menu items and food is fine. Service is a little haphazard although staff are friendly. Seats over 800 but luckily for us, not busy the times we were there. The greeters are less than friendly and happy for customers to wait while they finish their conversation.",
        "I really enjoyed my stay here and will be back!\\nHighly recommend if your looking for a top tier hotel off the strip. \\nEverything from the room, staff, grounds were just about flawless.\\nOnly gripe was with the quality of the restaurants and buffet which just really all needs to be revamped.",
        "Our first visit. Sat on the patio and after 10 long minutes had to flag a server. If not for a time crunch my guest and I would have left. Servers all appeared overwhelmed and less than friendly. Not acceptable for upscale Scottsdale establishment on a Friday night. Good management appears to be lacking and it's a shame as this location has all the ingredients to be 4-5 stars consistently.",
        "WORST color &  cut job ive ever had! The color was spotchy, faded into a goldish color the very next week & the cut was un-even. I ended up having to go to someone else to fix her horrible attempt at  \\\"high lights\\\" !!!!

        "Do not even stay here. The worst treatment I have ever received. Unbelievable! The spa is terrible as is everything else. Honestly, the Wynn came highly recommended and it was the worst experience in a hotel ever. 10% of the people were nice and the other 90% were absolutely horrible and disgraceful. It does not even deserve 1 star.",
        "This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "What an amazing spot! They've got a huge beer selection with some on draft and most in bottles. Where else can you get live music with cheap beer? It is an old converted house and is hard to find. Supposedly they do that on purpose because they don't want to be flooded with people. That really makes no sense since it isn't on a busy street. However, this is probably one of the better spots I've been to in the Phoenix Metro Area.",
        "This place is as bad to be expected! \\n\\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \\n\\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!",

        "Used to love this place, wonderful food, but went today at lunch and what a disappointment.  One poor guy behind the counter trying to assemble meals with no help, and so slow.  Had the smoked chicken sandwich, mac & cheese and coleslaw.  The chicken was just ordinary, mac & cheese was soupy and tasteless and the coleslaw was not seasoned at all.  Maybe new management as the choice of meals is much less than previously.  What a shame.",
        "This place is entertaining as hell.  It was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once, and the beer selection was massive.  Unfortunately I got so sick from the food that I had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss Cirque du Soliel.",
        "Horrible bank! Rude and unhelpful!",
        "Interior can certainly be modernized, however the food is solid. I'm not a fan of paying to sub hash browns and a english muffin for fruit. Seeing as how I am now paying more for less food. All in all, US Egg is a solid stop in spot every now and then. One of those resturants you're glad that exists, but you'll never take anyone there to show them.",
        "Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.",
        "The 2 stars are for the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  Everything else here was just blah.  My friend and I split the crispy rice and the sea bass.  Crispy rice was good but rediculously expensive (I think $14 or 16 for 4 pieces??)  The sea bass tasted like rubber and there wasnt much of it.  I'm used to high prices being from nyc...but I expect the food to be good.  Very dissapointed.",
        "Expensive. They Don't have the red bull sugar gumming bear.\\n\\nOnly cool thing is location.  One of places I stay when I go vegas.",
        "I don't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines. Two weeks was what I was informed that it would take to fix my unit. I followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they haven't even started working on it.",
        "Fantastic shrimp po-boy!  The ingredients were really fresh, the bread was soft and tasty, the shrimp crispy and the sauce was delicious.  It will be hard getting anything else.  I'll have to though since their other dishes look great as well!",
        "The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\\n\\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it.",
        "I want to start off by saying I didn't attend the Luau. I stayed at the IP during a very big convention and couldn't find rooms anywhere else.  I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.",
        "Thought the place was decent. Liked the Shima roll. Everything else was good. But did not have the WOW factor working for them",

        "Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist, when you move elsewhere you just have to go back... you know what I mean. I'll be 45, unemployed, living in Philly and still flying to PHX to have these guys clean my clothes.",
        "Fresh, hot, made to order burgers and fries, and shakes that are to die for... What else could you ask for in a burger joint?! I love being able to build my dream sammich every time and indulge in differently flavored fries and extravagant shakes. Love it!",
        "I did my grocery shopping mostly here while I was on vacation. It got the job done but is nothing special. The produce section was smaller then I would have liked but they have a whole aisle for healthy more organic options. Staff is not very friendly. Meh, gets the job done but nothing to ride home about",
        "If you want more of an upscale feel of a casino then look no further! Make sure you bring plenty cash because the winnings over here are a lot less likely. I mean it's vegas and once you find your favorite place to gamble stick to it. It's one of those to each is own kind of situations but I rather not gamble here. Never had much luck but have friends who have!",
        "One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix, this place is acids the street fro LeiLei's and hidden from view. Don't miss it. Try the chicken wings and especially the grapes leaves. The staff are very nice. The ambiance is wanting and music dated, but this is a must.",
        "Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again",
        "I will never bring my stuff here again!! They send their stuff out to clean so they TAKE NO REPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CLOTHES.  If you care about the things you buy I would go somewhere else",
        "This was sad sad place. Even being the weekend the place didn't have many patrons. Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.",
        "OK but not great.  Chicken and waffles dish had a tough piece of chicken deep fried in what must have been several days old grease.  It was terrible.  The maple syrup was so watery - a give away that suggested it was some cheap liquid soap-like stand in from Cisco or worse, Costco.\\n\\nGo someplace else - go anywhere else.",
        "The food was good a bit overpriced but whatever. The problem was the service the lady working at the register was unfriendly and unresponsive. I had ordered the green salad instead of the Mac salad but instead she gave me the Mac salad. I told her it was wrong and rudely she said it would be 50\\u00a2 more. Waited 20 minutes then just left. The lady that works there is brain dead.",
        "Love it that the staff is always friendly and knowledge.  No pressure to hurry and not pressure to buy.  \\n\\nOnly if the games were organized a little bit, then they will get the 5th star.

        "Great produce, good small appliance selection and terrible customer service.   We used to shop here weekly, but have stopped in the last couple of years because of the uniformly unfriendly folks at checkout.   Unfortunately, the final impression is always the most lasting.  While the employees in produce, meats and other departments are all really great, the checkers here make shopping a very unpleasant experience"

The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \\\"Colorado cigarettes\\\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part.",

I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",
        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch.

        "The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",
        "Literally d'lish. I think I've had and loved everything on the menu. Nuts&berries salad, california club, turkey club, southwest burrito bowl, protein burger, ...everything. healthy and amazing.",
        "This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \\\"No Meat March,\\\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Small and cozy diner atmosphere. Good friendly customer service. Burgers and fries are really good. I will be visiting this place often to get my hamburger fix!",
        "Besides pizzerias, this is one of our favorite kid friendly places to eat while in Mesa, AZ. The burgers, fries and shakes just hit the spot (like In n Out back home). The seating situation at this location is way better than the location in Mesa, AZ.",
        "Ordered take out. Best potato salad I've EVER had!! The crab cakes were delish and the corn bread was a perfect accompaniment. I also enjoyed the brown rice as well as the pasta. Can't wait to get back here and try more stuff!!",
        "Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\\n\\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back.",
        "CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!",
        "Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Shut up. Go Here. And get the Mac Gnarly Burger or any burger...yum.\\n\\nBeachy vibe...awesome fries too man i'm hungry. Just do it.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\\nand their savory scones.\\n\\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays.",
        "I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "Waffles were so good, but other breakfast items could make this place a hit. Also, not a large seating area.",
        "Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",
        "Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \\n\\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20.",
        "Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!\\nCornbread is sick !!!\\nAlso try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. \\nMy fav place in CU",
        "This was the first and last time that I will go to Red Robin.  The waitress, named Katie, was terrible.  The restaurant was only half full, but she took forever to come to our table.    I ordered a black and blue burger. It was just awful and terribly over-priced,  even the tea tasted bad,  I actually left thirsty.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",
        "I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "I LOVE in n out burger, but this particular location kind of lacks.\\n\\nI order a double double, mustard grilled, no onions with chopped chillies.\\n\\nMy burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale.",
        "i got the famous andys sage benedict.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more..",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",
        "The oysters here were really good. The price here is very fair for seafood. Although the reason that I'm giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt. We ordered the seafood gumbo and I had to take a gulp of water everytime I took a bite of my gumbo.",
        "Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.",
        "The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.",
        "Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge.",
        "Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "I wanted to order a \\\"gourmet\\\" burger as their sign advertises. When I tried to order it medium-rare I was told medium-well or well only. Huh? Gourmet burgers and you won't even cook to temperature? If you don't trust how your meat is being handled I'm sure not going to.",
        "As far as college students go, this is the place to be for birthdays and pregaming. For birthdays, you get all-you-can-drink free beer, mug, a tiny sundae and a balloon. My friends and I all love the cheese curds with gritty sauce and the gritty burgers. Power hour (every night from 10-11pm) has $1 mixers and is the best bar to begin drinking at.",
        "I was working inside the Venetian and went here for dinner with work associates after a long day. They offer gluten free pasta. It was good and convenient. Nothing totally amazing. They have a good and extensive wine list. I also had a bloody mary here a different day and it was delicious (we had a hard time finding bloodys in Vegas).",
        "The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!",
        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "Derald's is a popular fast food place and they do business from a small truck. They are located near Mathews Ave and Green St and another is at Mathews Ave and Springfield. Burgers are made-to-order and they are cheap.The fish burger (only on Fridays) is one of the best I have had but I don't think they use really fresh fish. It tastes really good with tartare sauce, onions and vinegar.",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "So so burger,good service. I was not impressed w food.",
        "This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \\nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",
        "One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.\\n\\nI went with the kitchen sink combo.  The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!",
        "Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \\\"three amigos\\\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!",
        "Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\\n\\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.",
        "I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",
        "I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.",
        "I actually love everything about this place except one critical problem. The buns are probably the worst buns I know of anywhere. They are horrible, and they fall apart. I took the time to write the company, no response. I can walk there, love everything else, but cant go for a burger. sad",
        "I typically don't go down to the strip but when I do I at least expect to get high quality food (even if it is overpriced).  I realize this place is just a coffee shop but I never expected they would serve a steak that had been tenderized with papaya enzymes.  seriously gross.  the crab cake was ok but the best part was the remoulade.  also had a chopped salad that wasn't bad but it was over dressed.",
        "This cafe was so good. The raw pizzas and burgers were excellent.  They also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes. The Cookies and Cream' shake was my favorite.  I strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the Vegas area.",
        "Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison.",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.",
        "Closest I've found to NJ/NY bagels in Charlotte area.. Bagels are pretty great, had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious.  A little neater (fluffy scrambled egg) and less greasy than a true Brooklyn bagel,but that's really not a complaint and I guess that's the Charlotte touch .",
        "If you just imagine you're in mainland China, this will feel right. Service is a bit strange,  but it's traditional Chinese service. I come for the ever elusive, hard to find chichen chop suey, and I love it !",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.",
        "Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.",
        "Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.",
        "first off i am not a fan of this place at all. There are various places in charlotte with the same set up doing it way better. The onion rings where not what i expected greasy and lacking in flavor. My burger was sub par but i did enjoy my milkshake. Maybe it was just a bad day but it didn't win me over enough to ever come back.",
        "I stop by about ounce a month with my wife it's out the way for me but well worth it the bay of pigs rocks a must go.",
        "Pricey but well its in The Mirage so i guess i needs to be pricey. Great burger though. If you are in the Mirage try it out. :)",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "Yo! I got a burger and peanut butter milkshake here! How fuckin rad is that! Peanut butter milkshake son! Burger was rad too!",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.",
        "I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere.",
        "Great food until 2 am. Really healthy (and other) options in Vegas basically when you want them is pretty impressive. Everything I tried was great (salads, juices, wraps), and this is my second trip back. Worth a regular trip even when I'm in town as a tourist for late-night munchies.",
        "O boy I just discovered ROCKET BURGERS &SUBS. TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! This is the first time in a long while I drank 7-up from a bottle...tha fries are the bomb too!!!!!",
        "There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas.",
        "very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun."

Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!",
        "Decent food. But.... I ordered an Irish coffee, and they gave me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey on the side. I asked the bartender if she knew how to make this simple drink. She said, \\\"we don't do that here\\\". Wow. I asked for the remaining ingredients, and I was charged for each individual ingredient. $17.00 Irish coffees at Brazwells. Condescending staff.",

I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",

His staff  is equally rude aswell.",

A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\\n\\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.

The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "I was really disappointed in this place after the consistent glowing reviews. I ordered the sweet crepes with bananas, my daughter got chicken fingers. Her food was very hot and mine was cold when it arrived. Waitress never came back to refill drinks until I got up to pay check. I just missed all the craze.... It's like an ihop to me",

Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "Future Tenant is a great non-traditional art gallery. they focus on multi-disciplinary art, so there's always something different going on. they have traditional 2-D art shows, theatre performances, open mic nights, and public window installations. it's a pretty great place for emerging artists to get noticed. and during events there's an open bar, which is always a plus.",
        "After reading all the negative comments about their customer service I was apprehensive going in there this afternoon. But I've shopped at their London and Swiss stores and love the brand. I must admit all those fears came to naught. All the girls were very helpful. Especially the girl in the changing area. She helped me diligently for the almost 2 hrs I was there. All the staff were most helpful and prompt in checking for sizes. Great experience overall!",
        "I think Korina might have mixed this place up with somewhere else - or perhaps has an ex-boyfriend working there... \\n\\nCommunity Tire is one of the most professional companies I have ever done business with, and they definitely stand behind their work 100%.\\n\\nI have used two of the Community Tire locations and had nothing but perfect results. Fast, fair, friendly! Plus, they give back a lot to the local community.",
        "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.",
        "Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away.",
        "Great place!\\nI've never had to wait very long for a walk-in, maybe 20 mins at most. \\nThe staff is friendly and does a great job.\\nPrices are consistent with similar salons.\\n\\nParking can be tough in this shopping center, but that isn't the fault of the salon.",
        "My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend.",
        "They were late seating is, an that's the only negative! Awesome dinner for five. Would highly recommend!",
        "Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.\\n\\nAs a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, \\n\\nFood was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like.",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "2nd time in a row that they have overbooked and now I am waiting for a car. Why bother making reservations when they don't have enough cars! I was supposed to pick up my car at 11:15 am and it is 12:30, and they say it will be ready in another 30 mins. Whoever the operations manager is should seriously consider other career paths, because clearly this is not an area of strengh!",
        "Had a bad experience, you couldn't get a place to sit unless you spent $700 plus on bottle service. Had half the club roped of and empty. FYI it was $45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes, it was that much of a downer",
        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..",
        "It's 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant !!! Asked if the AC was on. Oh yes she would check??  It's 90 plus. AC is not working!!! Daaahh",
        "I hate to leave a negative review because I love getting hair here but I realized today they're ripping people off. I bought hair and it was $99 on the price sticker. When I got home I noticed the sticker had been placed over another. I peeled back the sticker and the other price was $45 and they tried to sharpie through it. Over a 50% markup?!?! I believe I'll start shopping elsewhere!",
        "Host knows just what customer service is. Friendly and handed us complimentary VIP wristbands.  More mature crowd than other nearby places (which is a good thing). Music is good.",
        "I'm not easily bored with food, so i find it really offensive when I was here and the meal was not exciting. From decoration to menu, it was all a snore.\\nI dont usually use how busy a dining floor is to judge how good a restaurant is, but when we were here, the place was completely empty, so i'm positive I wasnt the only person that was bored with this place.",
        "Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. \\nCan't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. \\nCheers & good luck",
        "One of the best dive restaurants ever. The portions are generous and the quality is consistent.\\nThe corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient & friendly. Great value and worth the visit.",
        "This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!",
        "Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it....\\\"I need to go to the bathroom...Hula's bathroom\\\". That's the restaurant across the street.\\n\\nBest laugh I had all night",
        "This is where I usually go when visiting downtown. The atmosphere is great. I think its what makes this place. Its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls. There is also a dance floor and dj in the back. Last time I got a pretty rude bartender though. Only negative thing I have to say.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "Renovated and gorgeous. Plus arriving here is just the best feeling in the whole world. Just writing this review makes me ready to party",
        "Are there twice while staying at the Mirage. There was a little bit of a wait, the food was delicious. I had the biscuits with gravy and the potato hash. Delicious! Had pancakes and bacon. Yummy too!  This place will be on my list for the next trip to Vegas. Plus it's 24 hours. Can't beat that!",
        "With moving to the other side of town, it was nice to find a new sushi spot near by. Service and rolls are great. Plus, they have a great happy hour that has options of 4-8 pieces. It gives you the option to try a lot of different rolls. All in all, it's a nice little spot and I've loved everything I've tried. Nice place as my last one was I Love Sushi.",
        "Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \\\"Sammy\\\" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \\\"I'll be with you in a moment\\\" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",
        "I absolutely love this barre studio! The instructors are so personable and really make an effort to make you feel comfortable. The classes are hard but I always have a great sense of accomplishment after each class. I've been going for several months and have been able to see positive changes in my body. The studio is beautiful and always clean. They also have a studio in Chandler if you live in that part of town. Definitely worth checking out.",
        "The rooms were okay for what they were.\\n\\nThe complimentary breakfast was a joke.  The lines were ridiculous and some \\\"crowd control\\\" was definitely needed in my opinion.\\n\\nThe restaurant (Rocky River Grille) was horrible.   Service was slow and food was very bland.\\n\\nI would not stay here again.  It is not worth the price.",
        "Worst Customer Service I have EVER recieved in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible. We got stuck in there over 3 hours. Our server was rude. Food was mediocre.",
        "Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars",
        "When I lived in the area, I used to come here a lot both to eat in and take out. The quality has gone down a bit over the last year - the last few times we went, the service wasn't great, the portions are getting smaller, plus they are giving too many vegetables and not enough meat. However, they do make a great Pad Thai.",
        "This place obviously changed their hours and didn't update anything else except the door on their business. Last time I came by, they were closed randomly. Ok, I understand things happen and it's necessary. No problem. However, now they are closed on Sundays and didn't bother to update their answering service or information online. Annoying.",
        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",
        "On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here.  SUPER friendly waiter named Brian.  Excellent service,  great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95.  Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a \\\"thatta boy\\\".  Not one negative.",
        "First time there. Had the chop chop salad with grilled chicken. Salad was more julienne sliced thin. Thought it would be large chopped pieces. Grilled chicken was tasty! Service was friendly and consistent thru the meal. They even asked if we wanted drinks to go which I liked a lot. Kind of lid inside since it's a bar/restaurant combined on an open setting, with TV's all around.",
        "This is one of my favorite Starbucks - not that I drink at any Starbucks particularly often. The location is a big plus, and the workers are always friendly. They are efficient as well - they have to be, considering how much traffic this store gets. If you walk in and see a bit of a line, just know that it tends to move fairly quickly.",
        "I didn't care for the outdoor parking.  On a sweltering summer's day I am not too keen on walking around the parking lot looking for my car then suffering 1st degree burns from the hot seat.\\nIt does have some of the brands I like & they are in an A/C enclosed setting so that was a plus.  Now the food court is truly pathetic.  Talk about having to choose from Bad or really bad food.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "Yet again I had to go to this place and yet again I come up with the same question\\n\\\" WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SERVING WATER IN THOSE SMUDGY BOTTLES??\\\"\\nand YES! yet again i saw some floaters in my water....i would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread",
        "Don't get me wrong the bugers were great, perfectly cooked, Five Guys strawberry was good. But it wasn't mindblowing. Now I say the location in front of the flatiron building is more fun looking than being packed like sardines in a resturant. But it was still fun and the line was long but moved fast. Would recommend for a quick cheap bite. Fighting people for a seat will be neccasary, not impossiable.",
        "Came here in July. It was hot. Not just hot but hot as hell. That was inside. On the balcony. There was a cool view of downtown Fremont. But it is even hotter. I was in there looking for air conditioning vents. The bar was OK. Nothing real special besides the view of the Fremont. I would return in a cooler month if i am downtown again. The music was good. That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.",
        "Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.",
        "Their employees are the rudest human beings alive... The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever. Whatever happened to customer service and pleasing guest. They clearly have no mission they are following at this Sugar Factory in particular, the one in Town Square is def. better!",
        "Went here last night for the first time last night... Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)",
        "Got in for free on Thursday night. The music was honestly the BEST when no one else was on the floor. So that's why it was just me and my girl dancing on the floor. The moment the hip hop came on, it was mixed so badly that i just was annoying.You couldn't really get into it to make much of a dance. But very nicely decorated and $15 martinis!",
        "Don't be fooled. Charlotte doesn't seem to have much to compare. I'm a tough critic because I'm from the west coast. Not that great.",
        "The food was, how to say this without offending, white people version of Mexican.  It was bland to the taste, overcooked and bland, and god forbid they make it themselves rather than pour it directly out of the can. It was edible, though slightly overpriced for what you get.",
        "It's a pretty big Walmart. Has its own deli among other things, a Wetzel's Pretzels and a McDonalds. Plus this place is open 24 hours (not the deli and McDonald's). Classic Walmart prices as well.\\n\\nNot a bad place for Black Friday either. Everything mainstream is partitioned in the center aisles rather than their usual locations. Helps get the chaos over with quickly.",
        "Decent prices.  $21 for 2 huge sandwiches.  felt like boa constrictors as we left.  Reuben sandwich was good on terrific rye.  Fries excellent!  Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!",
        "To bad Jennifer isn't going to be working on Saturdays anymore, they really need to do some training with this help, sat here for 30 minutes, waiters came over twice to take our order, both times asked for menus, he never brought it over. We had to ask another waiter. This is extremely unusual for this restaurant. We will start coming here only when Jennifer or Sergio are bartending.",
        "Friendly and superior customer service brings me back to them time and time again.  My packages are always delivered on time...I do all of my shipping, printing and purchases at Cliff's Pony Express.  I highly recommend!  A TEN PLUS!",
        "Food was good but I was quite surprised when my Gin Martini got delivered and the lemon twist floating in it still had the sticker from the grocery store/orchard...clearly the bartender that peeled the twist and rimmed the glass with it, as well as the server that brought it didn't think twice about the fact that there was blatantly a large sticker that said, \\\"Sunkist\\\" floating in the drink as well",
        "This was a great place, however i was billed extra nights i didn't stay and its taken 3 days of on the phone talking to customer service and the bank just to resolve a problem that should have never occurred. \\n\\nI think i'll stay somewhere else next time, plus i won't have to wait one hour to check in and out.",
        "Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \\nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.",
        "Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\\n\\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\\n\\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall.",
        "I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.",
        "Cute store but so tiny plus they seem so overpriced for what they sell.  I enjoy the display but after going in Charming Charlie its hard to be willing to overpay for similar items and purses etc.",
        "Food quality was very disappointing. Our medium rare steaks came out very well done, and the chicken tasted like cardboard. There are many better choices out there.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the mojitos were great.",
        "Mostly average, but I would give 3.5 stars if I could...\\n\\nCrust was boring, sauce was bland and minus a point for canned vegetables :(\\n\\nOn the positive side, they are generous with the toppings and the service was pretty good.\\n\\nFind a new dough recipe, add some spice to your sauce use fresh vegetables for 5 stars.",
        "Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face\\n :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope \\nThis information is useful :)",
        "I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit.",
        "Fantastic! Bulgarian food is always delicious but these cooks go above and beyond to bring back childhood memories. I left feeling so satisfied! On top of all this the service was impeccable. \\nIf you are looking for fast food go somewhere else because all the food was made fresh right after you order. Perfect for socializing with friends around big plates of delicious memories!",
        "This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\\n\\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.",
        "Bomb food! Plain and simple! The pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and I love the chicken and Gorgonzola salad! Plus it's central to old town, walking distance from the clubs or the mall- major bonus",
        "Yum! If you need a quick pizza come here, or better yet have them deliver. I love the thin crust pizza, will never get papa john's again when we order in. The pizza is always hot, flavorful, and fresh. Plus you can't beat the price and they mail out coupons too!",
        "I have gone here for breakfast numerous times when I am in LV.  They have a large menu, service is quick and I have always had good food.  The only negative is that their coffee is low grade, just barely drinkable.  Its certainly worth the 10 minute drive for better food and lower prices than what you can find on the Strip.",
        "i love this place. i have been going here since before the moved it into the old church. the owners are nothing but sweethearts and the food is delicious and totally inexpensive. plus i just love the atmosphere.",
        "Great service and an awesome business. Used bikes without the head ache. 30 day warranty plus a trade in program. I bought two bikes from bicycle exchange and couldn't be happier.\\n\\nwho trys to buy a bike for $50 bucks and expects quality and a warranty?"

        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "Nice Hotel but Bad Casino...\\n\\n-the gambling floor is really small.\\n-they did not have food service at the pool but said they will soon, this was in March.\\n-tried to upsell me a better view of the fountain for 35 more a night, I didnt bite. i got the back side of the airport...Pist.\\n-for 20 bux more i could of stayed at Caesars Palace that weekend",
        "I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",
        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.",
        "This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch. I had the chicken and waffles today and it was the perfect balance of southern diner meets gourmet gravy with bacon maple syrup. I live around the corner... looking forward to going back.",
        "This is a great small restaurant, great service and food was delicious! Try the Full taco and it was amazing!",
        "Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it.",

        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Conveniently located. Fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit. They also do takeaway pastry (mediocre looking pastry), sandwiches, and beverages.\\n\\nPeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though! JEEBUS that stuff was scalding. My latte was out to torture tongues.",
        "My only place to go for Chinese food. Sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic, but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is! \\nThey have a fantastic tofu bowl (Hot and spicy bean curd) which is perfectly spiced! Others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed. \\nIf you're looking to be snooty about your Chinese food, go somewhere else. Otherwise this place is perfect.",
        "Very good!  I had the Carne asada fries, and Carne asada taco,  and my daughter had a cheese quesadilla.  Muy delicioso!  Roberto's is officially my go to Mexican food spot.  Service was fast, food was good, and it's open 24 hours.  Doesn't get better than that!",

The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!",
        "Mediocre galettes and that was a really disappointing thing during my recent trip to Montreal.\\n\\nI told that to my Montrealer friend who said, \\\"told you so\\\". \\n\\nThat being said, their desserts and coffee choices were fantastic. Anything with chocolate, Juliette et Chocolat does okay. Just don't rely on their dinner menu!",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.",

        "Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)\\n\\nI had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)",
        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",
        "Nice place, nice atmosphere, and I've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre. I'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist, 'heavy' bread, which I'm sure some people love. I've just discovered Wildflower Bread Company and their bread is 'perfect' for me - drier, lighter, but still with moisture and 'stretch' or 'bite'.",
        "Went through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich. Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems. I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough. Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe.",
        "I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "A decent sandwich for a decent price. Not the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  Everything is \\u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to get here JUST for a sandwich, but if you are nearby it probably won't disappoint",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.",
        "I can't really say too much about this place since I only had drinks, and that was a mojito, which isn't my favorite drink. I did have a strawberry mojito which was actually really good. My friend had a coconut mojito and she loved it. The specialty menu shows mostly mojitos so I think its kind of a niche for them.",
        "Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "I really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged. 10 min. Is just too long.  Then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass.  Not good...not good.",
        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",
        "This place is just ok for me. The restaurant has a nice setting, good service, and nice entertainment. The food is good but not great for the price. The steaks were slightly over aged for my taste, au gratin potatoes were very tasty though. They have a nice wine list with many options for all budgets. Its worth a try if you are at gvr and looking for a nice meal but I prefer most of the steak houses on the strip over this place.",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "Nice, big patio to enjoy a conversation and catch up with friends. The inside was clean and service was nice. All the pastries looked especially tasty at this location. Nice job.",
        "Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills.",
        "One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.\\n\\nI went with the kitchen sink combo.  The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \\\"three amigos\\\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!",
        "Great patio. Great wine selection. Tasty food. Enjoy downtown Matthews!!",
        "The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings.",
        "I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.\\n\\nThat said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y.",
        "I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too.",
        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",
        "This place is horrible. They lie to you and tell you that u win gifts or a trip and that u dont come out of pocket. I asked if it was a time share and they told me no. When I got there it was timeshare. And the gifts that they tey to give u that u dont come out of pocket u do pay for. They are liars and tricked us into  what turned out to be nothing they talked about!",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better.",
        "Franz\\u00f6sische T\\u00f6rtchen und guter Kaffee: das suche ich einem Kaffee. \\nHier im Ludwig ist die Qualit\\u00e4t erstklassig, der Service gut, aber nicht der aufmerksamste. \\nDer Preise sind f\\u00fcr die innerstadt von KA in Ordnung.",
        "Beste Qualit\\u00e4t und die Preis Leistung stimmt einfach. Besser geht es nicht.",
        "David Woolen always does a fantastic job - friendly, courteous and careful around areas where pets and kids play. I appreciate Bulwark Exterminating's always fantastic customer service.",
        "Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.",
        "A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it.",
        "Mediocre quality food. Tasted fine, but was lukewarm. The fries were cold and I recieved half a cup of fries. Not a good experience at all for over $20. Will not eat here again.",
        "Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.\\n\\nI goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation. \\n\\nI recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible.",
        "Great little tacos on Fremont St. Carne Asada tacos and spanish rice were good. Cheep eats and open late!",
        "Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.\\n\\nAs a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, \\n\\nFood was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like.",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here.",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Pi\\u00f1a Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.",
        "very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun.",
        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "As a bar it's pretty decent. As for the food well... If you're going to prepare ALL your food in a microwave, can you at least hide it somewhere in the back. I would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos.",
        "Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.",
        "Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.",
        "One of our downtown Phoenix staples. I love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas. Annnd the spicy harissa fries. ...Aaaand the hummus. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order.",
        "Oysters good. Chicken was smelly. Adult tater tots good. Took our servicer for.ever. to split our checks. Mediocre across the board.",
        "Horrible bland food. Horrible service, but a sweet girl. TVs were waaaay too loud -only 30 people in the huge place, the loud volume was not necessary. Table was dirty. We'll never go back.",
        "It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",

        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "Jim Barker, Debbie Wilson and Ashley Ford.  Avoid!  My loan went pass the date and the sellers are pissed and put in a 3 day cure notice.  Now they are asking for items that they should of asked for weeks ago.  I don't think they even open the Email that I sent them, unprofessional and I will probably lose this house and money because of there mistakes.  Process was the worst, thank God we got the house",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.",

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "I go there all the time. I went almost every viet restaurant around the neighborhood and this place the best. Cheap and high quality food. Try pho combo and u wont regret it. Open 24/7/365 and always clean and serve good food. They give good amount of bean sprouts too. Highly recommended.",
        "Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!  They were short handed due to unexpected departure of an employee and went out of their way to make sure the customers left happy.  Food was fresh and delicious, love that grilled pita.  Will be going back again soon!",

        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good.

I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",

However this place loses a star because when you order for pick up, you get very little food. Disappointing for the price you pay. You almost want to eat in the restaurant every time because only then do do you get the amount of food you pay for.",

I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too.",

We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",

        "This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)",

        "This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.",

I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",

        "Found this place after I moved to the Southwest a few years ago when it was the only thing in the area. Years later, even after new owners and a name change, it's still the only pizza I've needed. Good South Jersey style red pies and they have a very good white with ricotta as well.",
        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",
        "Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!",
        "Our son has constant nose bleeds so his pediatrician's office referred us to dr.boyers. we got in for an appointment and we're shocked with the abusive and hostile manner in witch this doctor conducted himself. He was so rude yelling and screaming at our son who is autistic that my wife was contemplating calling the police. Bottom line is dr.boyers was distasteful and a sorry excuse of a doctor. His staff  is equally rude aswell.",
        "Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here.",
        "My husband said it very accurately: \\\"its a once in a lifetime experience.\\\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.  It seems to me that the sandwiches are not anything great once you look past its size.  I ate it with the fries and cole slaw, but I could have done without the fries.  It is just a filler.\\nThe atmosphere as fun and very casual.",
        "The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",
        "This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner.",
        "Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \\nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.",
        "This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.",
        "Took my wife here last week with flu symptoms, it wasn't very busy but it still took about an hour and a half before we left. The wait time was okay considering there was only one doctor for the whole place. The nurse was not overly friendly as she asked all the questions that we already filled out on their forms. I suppose the establishment serves its purpose when you can't get in to see your primary care doctor.",
        "We went for an event the other night and WOW best food in town, seriously!!! They serve 4 dif salads all FABULOUS, 4 did piazzas 'to die for' & 4 dif pastas all Fantastic, my fav was angle hair pasta with Tomatoe sauce, I'm going back SOON!! Y'all should go TODAY!!!",
        "I went here for dinner.  I had the steak with risotto.... I ate it all.\\n\\nIt was good. Meh.  It was good.  I don't know.  I feel like I'm trying to convince myself that it was indeed good because I wanted it so much for it to be REALLY good... but it was good.",
        "Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \\n\\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance.",
        "Meh. Pretty boring in my opinion. I cant think of any particular segments were I thought it was funny/cool. \\n\\nThe last 10minutes was entertaining though. Or maybe I was just excited for the show to finally be over. I dont know. \\n\\nDont recommend.. at all.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment .",
        "If you are Colombian (Like me) then I would say this is a descent Colombian bakery, Pandebono, Pan de Yuca, empanadas and arepas are good, finger food per say, the other main dishe.....well...not so sure, but finger food is good, also really good colombian Coffee ( Cafe con Leche) I come here quite regularly for my Chicharron con arepa and pandebonos.",
        "I love this restaurant! The portions are generous, and the food is flavorful and filling. The service was awesome and they were definitely attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe wait time for the food was not long at all, but to keep us entertained, they have books and games at the tables to pass the time. Such a fun idea.\\n\\nI highly recommend the fish and chips or the blue cheese bacon burger!",
        "Great crew.  Each person has something special to offer and they all know what they are doing.  My mom switched after 10 years with Verizon because of some Bozo there...  Much happier with AT&T.",
        "I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)",
        "These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Ate ate Popeye at many states, this is not it!\\nThe spicy chicken is NOT spicy yet it contains more grease then chicken, purely inedible. no idea how they get away with it in a corporate environment.",
        "Pros: Very fun and friendly, energetic employees. Delicious drinks. Smoothies for the kiddos. I love going to this place.\\nCons: Poor location. The parking lot is congested so it makes the one line very long and challenging to get through as they sometimes stack people in two lines and try to get them to merge into one.",
        "Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food.",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "Small and cozy diner atmosphere. Good friendly customer service. Burgers and fries are really good. I will be visiting this place often to get my hamburger fix!",
        "WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \\n\\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!",
        "Brought my car in for an oil change because I had a coupon. Two weeks later I noticed oil stains in my garage where I park. I brought it back to my regular mechanic and he said that the Firestone mechanic that worked on it left the washer out when they put the oil tank plug back in and it was leaking.",
        "Used to be a cheesy place but now it's classy and centrally located. It's rather affordable too!",
        "This is one Buffet that we love to go to mainly because of the Great food and fantastic service not mention the excellent ambience",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "Average. OK winelist, food basic Italian without much thought, ambience OK. Would I recommend it? Not if I could walk somewhere closer....",
        "The worst place to buy cigarettes do not shop here the owner is a nasty human being. They think they are doing you a favor by you shopping in its store. If you enjoy being treated like crap and yelled at than  shop here because you get plenty of abuse here.  And for some strange reason they always want you to pay in cash",
        "So the family would like me to start off by saying wouldn't it be nice if the servers smiled at least once. Oh yes and why are they so stingy with the butter. Oh and when did they change their menu. \\nI guess we shouldn't expect good things to remain good forever, but we can dream. We used to enjoy The Good Egg but now......well.....meh. Wish we still liked it but, no.",
        "I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.",
        "Had some tamales, and they were one of the worst I have ever had! There is no way this place is the best in town? Now I am not condemning this place, I will come back and give them another try. I will try something different and maybe I might change my mind. But I just don't get the hype!",
        "I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.",
        "Pristine did a great job. They were right on time, worked quickly, and were very thorough. They even paid attention to the small details like straightening up clothing that was scattered, dusting in hard to reach areas, etc. Highly recommended!",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "Poor service, lack of cleanliness, and unbelievably bad food.. A one star is too high of a rating! No second chance deserved here - no way we will be back.",
        "This place was so packed when i was here. Like everyone else says the dance floor really isnt big at all. EVERYWHERE, and i mean everywhere possible is reserved for bottle service. Lucky for me im a woman and flirted my way to a grey goose cran and a seat- i feel sorry for the guys!\\n\\nAdd 2 stars because the line was HUUUGE and we walked straight to the front and into the club.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "I stopped going to this Einsteins awhile ago but when I was hungry walking by it the other day I just stopped thinking I would give it another chance. Boy I was wrong. Same old Einsteins I always new. The service was terrible and they rushed everything. Next time I need to remember to stay clear of this place and hit up another Einsteins",
        "Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.",
        "Delicious! And the owner is fabulous - very proud of his restaurant and the long family ties to it.",
        "I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.  \\n\\nLove the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.\\n\\nI could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do.",
        "I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.",
        "Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!",
        "SUPER PACKED!!! \\n\\nthere's a stage with velvet red curtains. we had a VIP table but even the VIP section was overcrowded! \\n\\ndon't get me wrong, i still had fun. but there were just too many damn people!!!!!!!",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",

        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

Open 24/7/365 and always clean and serve good food. They give good amount of bean sprouts too. Highly recommended.",

        "Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am  going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap.\\nDo not consider buying this....\\n\\n\\n'b",

We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",

        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good. I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",
        "Tried the lamb kubideh. It was very reasonable pricing, for $7.99 I got a healthy serving of kubideh with rice, and bread. They make the bread at the location! Everything tasted wonderful. And we ended our meal with a Baklava. Do try it!",
        "Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",

In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer.\\n\\nI will give it a try for dinner. Let's hope this time it will be less disappointing.",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",

        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",
        "Came here on a Friday night to have a drink at the prohibition bar located in the casino. I was impressed by how the dealers and dancers in the middle of the floor never stopped shaking and bouncing. It really helped in keeping the energy up in the room. The tables were busy and so was the bar, but the service was still good. Additionally, their vallet is always super nice.",

The place is definitely tiny compared to the other clubs around but the music was good and I loved the huge booth seating. Also, their patio is pretty big and the view is nice. I'd definitely come back here to start off the night.",

Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \\n\\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon.",
        "Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...",
        "Update:  The Chompies in Scottsdale sent us a gift card to apologize for our experience.  That was not necessary although we did accept and we used it last night.  We did go to the location near Chandler mall and had a wonderful meal and experience.  The hostess and wait staff were pleasant and the food was very delicious.",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles.",
        "I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)",
        "Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.",
        "Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!",
        "Mediocre galettes and that was a really disappointing thing during my recent trip to Montreal.\\n\\nI told that to my Montrealer friend who said, \\\"told you so\\\". \\n\\nThat being said, their desserts and coffee choices were fantastic. Anything with chocolate, Juliette et Chocolat does okay. Just don't rely on their dinner menu!",
        "Literally d'lish. I think I've had and loved everything on the menu. Nuts&berries salad, california club, turkey club, southwest burrito bowl, protein burger, ...everything. healthy and amazing.",
        "I got my Sonic fix, so there is a couple stars for ya.\\n\\nSadly our fries were VERY undercooked, I didn't get any mustard with my plain hot dog, and we didn't get any napkins.\\n\\nThese are fast food basics, people.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Unexciting, bland and expensive! \\nService was good, if somewhat snobbish. \\nFood was nothing special run of the mill bland Italian fair.\\n\\nAll in all its probably not worth it. Especially for someone like myself who is really not Italian fan. \\n\\n\\\"I no like\\\"\\n\\nEugene",
        "I'm really amazed that this place is getting such great reviews. It is TERRIBLE. The food is bland and overly priced. The amount of pretention in the air from the staff is unbelievable. The service is poor, wait times even with reservations are not acceptable. I guess when people don't know what a good meal is, they just jump on the band wagon when one person somewhere talks about a 'cool, hip place'",
        "Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\\n\\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",
        "Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. \\nBreakfast is ok, but not more. \\nService is friendly. \\nNo twin rooms available..",
        "If it is supposed to be locals night on monday don't ask me for cover. Its an alright lounge but I am not paying cover for the right to purchase over priced drinks. I left they can keep their liquor on the shelves\\n\\nI have been there before its a nice view but not worth the hassle.",
        "By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\\n\\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different.",
        "Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\\n\\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality.",
        "My favorite Starbucks in the valley, always a warm and friendly staff and the only store that remembers me even tho I only go through the drive thru. This is the only store that I go to when I want my favorite drink (5 shot Americano in a trente cup), no other store will make this for me. I love this store, thank you to that crew! You guys are awesome!",
        "Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\\n\\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\\n\\nI would go back, but with low expectations.",
        "Dinner was poor service, bad food and too expensive.  Good location for happy hour only.",
        "I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.  \\n\\nLove the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.\\n\\nI could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do.",
        "Best croissance that's all u gotta say.....",
        "Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",
        "SUPER PACKED!!! \\n\\nthere's a stage with velvet red curtains. we had a VIP table but even the VIP section was overcrowded! \\n\\ndon't get me wrong, i still had fun. but there were just too many damn people!!!!!!!",
        "No reason to waste a meal here if you're visiting Montreal for a few days. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good. The place was filled with tourists (myself included) and the service was understandably indifferent. Felt like a wasted 2 hours.",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",
        "Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \\n\\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!\\nCornbread is sick !!!\\nAlso try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. \\nMy fav place in CU",
        "Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",
        "When in Vegas,\\n\\n1) buy a delicious \\\"adult slurpee\\\" in a delicious flavor right outside the Imperial Palace\\n2) bring said special, yard-long beverage into the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club\\n3) sing or mock karaoke\\n4) enjoy!\\n5) your pre-game is complete... time to go out!",
        "Not bad, but other nearby places offer better bang for the buck. Ugh- and the skinny white chair was extremely uncomfortable- not ideal for dining out. The seat of the chair had no padding and was too thin. A rethink of the chairs are a must and should be made an immediate priority.",
        "Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok.",
        "First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom.",
        "I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know.",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "I love Harold's. I have never been able to go there at night because I have two small children. So, all I can comment on is the food quality. I LOVE it! Everything has been good. From the pizza to the roast beef. Its a great place to go, especially with a child in their terrible twos.",
        "went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",
        "First time eating here last night. Started off with the hummus for an appetizer and got the gyro for my main meal. Everything was excellent..",
        "We went on the Friday night underwear night.. egads.. there was this guy in his undies bending over the bar.. I thought I saw a sign on his back that said, \\\"Insert here\\\" but it was pretty dark in there!\\n\\nSuper friendly and no attitudes.. a great place to hang out for a while.",
        "The Hilton Timeshare is the best during a Mayweather fight, I stayed here May 4th for the fight and I plan on staying here again in September for an upcoming fight. Being able to use my timeshare during special events in Las Vegas saves me a lot of $$$$.\\nThis place is just great."

        "A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside.",
        "Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!",
        "Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.",
        "Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",
        "I love this place! It's a great hang out on the strip. They have excellent service and great drinks :)",
        "Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.",

After waiting \\\"just a minute\\\" for 20 minutes, then using the dirty restroom, and being told \\\"2 more minutes,\\\" I decided to take my business elsewhere.  I will not be returning.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "I was here for about 10 minutes bc we were roaming through all the Palms clubs/bars and I really liked it. The place is definitely tiny compared to the other clubs around but the music was good and I loved the huge booth seating. Also, their patio is pretty big and the view is nice. I'd definitely come back here to start off the night.",

        "This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",
        "Riki and John are two of the best bartenders in Vegas. The bar is loud, fun, and great drinks.",
        "This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.",
        "Pros: Very fun and friendly, energetic employees. Delicious drinks. Smoothies for the kiddos. I love going to this place.\\nCons: Poor location. The parking lot is congested so it makes the one line very long and challenging to get through as they sometimes stack people in two lines and try to get them to merge into one.",

My Family and I ate here Wednesday We had such great service \\\"Carlos M\\\" it being our first time eatting  there he was very helpfull on answering our qwestions and offering sudjustions. He was always right there filling our drinks checking on how everything was.",
        "Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process.

        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "I was really disappointed in this place after the consistent glowing reviews. I ordered the sweet crepes with bananas, my daughter got chicken fingers.

Very large bathrooms and great patio space. Grills for cooking outside are super clean.",
        "Awesome place. Large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear. Pretty good deals that I liked. Bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable. You can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you. Very friendly and professional place.",
        "Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",
        "All of their food is great. Servers always have an opinion on what you should try if you're indecisive, and they're always spot on! Bartenders are fun and always attentive, but not too in-your-face. Great place to catch dinner and/or drinks with friends or family!",
        "Kind of a long drive from the heart of town but the casino is nice and clean.  You won't smell like smoke when you leave.  Decent machines and dining options.  The spa is nice.  I am a local so I have never stayed in their rooms.  The lattes from Baby Cakes are super.   Great sports book too.",
        "I really like Millers but this place is horrible at transitioning from the early to afternoon games on Sundays. The \\\"it'll be on these tv's after these games are over\\\" excuse is unacceptable. All the tv's are showing the same games!!!!  You're telling me with your high tech audio room you can't change some channels? It's either lazy or incompetent.",
        "Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.",
        "I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.",
        "If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.",
        "This unlikely little club is considered to be one of the best places in the Valley to catch local bands. It's hard to believe this place is in sleepy Mesa!\\n\\nThe food is good and the selection is HUGE: Pizza, Calzones, sandwiches, Gyros, subs, burgers, steaks, and Mexican food. Watch out though-- cheap drinks and live music can make this place a madhouse!",
        "Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess.",
        "Food was good but service was terrible. Went with large group of 12 to celebrate a  birthday. Plan was to eat have a few drinks then take in a movie. Ending up tsking 2 hours and thats not counting the time to eat",
        "POOR service!  Long Wait for Drinks!",
        "My boyfriend and I have stayed at Hotel Palomar twice now and we have had exceptional experiences each time! \\n\\nThis weekend we stayed for my birthday and the staff outdid themselves sending a bottle of wine, fruit platter, and a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card with vouchers for 2 drinks at the bar to our room. \\n\\nI highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to treat themselves to a nice fancy little getaway.",
        "The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,",
        "The Shiloh really makes you feel like you are home. The food is really good, the beers are varied, tasty and refreshing and the drinks are very moderately priced. I am not from Pittsburgh but I go there often and I always make the Shiloh my first pit stop! \\n\\nDo it!",
        "I was suprised how much I liked Kahunaville. Sandwiches are all very reasonably priced- around 11 bucks- and very large. The drinks are spendy like most of Vegas but be nice and they pour stiff. I highly recommend a Bombay and tonic yard. \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and professional, She did a great job especially since one of my group pulled a rude dipshit maneuver with an empty ketchup bottle.",
        "Reviews are pretty much right on. Stiff drinks, good prices for happy hour. Appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips, served on Plastic plates. On par with what Dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint.",
        "My husband and I had finally decided to have a date since my son was born(which is now 20 months old). We thought we deserve it and we want to have a romantic breakfast. I had the french toast and he got the croque madame. Both were delicious. I'm not a coffee person but we ordered coffee for our drinks. Coffee was delicious!",
        "The new rooms are nice, simple and straight to the point. Not extremely luxurious but still nice and comfy. The hotel also has a lot of restaurants and things to do and see like the tigers, and KA which I loved by the way! I might try staying at this hotel next time I am in Vegas because it's in the middle of the strip and is easily accessible from other areas of the strip.",
        "The pepperoni breadstick fondue was amazing and so we're the drinks I had. The mac and cheese burger was not as outstanding as I would have expected especially since it claimed to win some kind of award. And at nearly $20 for the burger alone, it was pretty pricey. All in all, I'd come back for the apps and drinks, but that's about it.",
        "Great place to stop in and have a drink as well as some appetizers. I personally just finished eating when we got to Typhoon, so I didn't get a chance to try their food. \\n\\nThe decor is lounge oriented and modern.  Service was excellent with very nice looking ladies that we're smiling the whole time serving drinks. \\n\\nI would recommend if your close to downtown Montreal.",
        "They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??",
        "You get what you pay for. Police where called to the room next to me. The rooms had a nice modern touch to them overall was a nice look however I did get bit by a bug while I was there.... Not cute.",
        "Didn't get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l.. really cool laid back feel. I think the whole design and the lighting. Service was really good. Will come back soon to check out the food.",
        "I want to start off by saying I didn't attend the Luau. I stayed at the IP during a very big convention and couldn't find rooms anywhere else.  I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.",
        "I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.",
        "The fish on the sushi gave my friend food poisoning. Worse part is the manager is literally watching you from the Cameras in the back. \\n\\nThe worst part is that if you order more of the same sushi they reduce the fish portion and increase the rice amount. I ONLY TASTED STICKY RISE!!!",
        "Went there for $1 Drink Thursdays and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about but the drinks were cheap so that was cool but other than that, nothing else was special:  Venue, Crowd, Decor.....\\n\\nCheap Drinks on Thursday.  But would I want to come here any other day....  Hmmmmm....",
        "I attended a meeting at Caesars in May.  I had been to Caesars many, many times, but have never stayed at the hotel.  They put us up in the Octavius Tower...very nice!  Big rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms and great views!",
        "Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it.",
        "Rooms are nothing special \\nGym is small\\nFree Drinks and Breakfast is only reason to stay here",
        "Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \\\"afterparty\\\" but I would rather stick to the main clubs.",
        "Free entrance,  free champagne all night for ladies,huka section, dance section, and 2 bars. The rooms are dark and sexy. What more could you ask for?  Enough said.\\n\\nHOWEVER, 2 well drinks=$26 bucks. ouch!",
        "Great place to get cold drinks and really good bar food! Bartenders are amazing and always friendly! Plenty of TV's to catch any game you wish! Can't go wrong here!",
        "The bomb- awesome- just like the Beverly Hills place.\\nNot only is the food amazing- but they actually used alcohol\\nin there drinks  (unlike many places in Vegas)\\nWe went on a Thursday night- and the eye candy of \\\"available\\\"\\nwomen waiting for clients was mind boggling.  \\nAll the senses my senses were tickled at dinner.",
        "Went here for drinks for one night. They called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out, making my friend chug her beer. And meanwhile it wasn't closing time yet. Very crappy service.",
        "Family friendly activities!\\n\\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over.",
        "You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking."

        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "The music is great here, it beckoned me to come and sit and pay a lot for a drink.  It really is an unassuming nice spot in the middle of the casino.  Luckily, it wasn't too packed so my large group could have a seat and have decent service.\\n\\nIf your in Mandaly, like music and such, and just need to take a quick load off, this is a great spot.",
        "3 stars for the revolving carousel bar.  \\n\\n\\\"Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. \\\"",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",
        "This place has a nice small bar feel but still delivers all the amenities. I frequent Tailgaters during UFC events but I also enjoy non event days as well.The food is above average for bar food and the staff is great. I recommend this place and you get what you pay for.",
        "I didn't have any coupons so paid 7.49 plus tax for this place.  I was pretty happy until I went to Main Street Cafe and paid 7.99 for three times the variety of food.  However, if you gots the coupon, then Paradise might be your bet.  I could really only find chicken worth eating...oh and a few items from the dessert area.",
        "I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness",
        "Derald's is a popular fast food place and they do business from a small truck. They are located near Mathews Ave and Green St and another is at Mathews Ave and Springfield. Burgers are made-to-order and they are cheap.The fish burger (only on Fridays) is one of the best I have had but I don't think they use really fresh fish. It tastes really good with tartare sauce, onions and vinegar.",
        "The food is bland and tasteless. Maybe I'm spoiled by good filipino food. The tocino is flavorless, how can this happen? The karekare had no flavor as wells as the adobo. Really? How can you botch those up? \\n\\nAt least the food was warm and fresh. But I would eat anything cold with more flavor. The food here isn't made with care. This is a big let down.",
        "Try the Aloha or Tart yogurt. Their toppings are yummy as long as you don't get the pineapple because I'm pretty sure it comes from a can. Gross. But the berries are always fresh. The patio is a bit loud but the location is cute.",

        "Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.",
        "I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.",
        "We couldn't get a table at Emeril Lagasse's place. So, we ended up here it was in the same hotel. The Oysters on the Half Shell and Tuna Tataki and Tartare was okay but pricey. For my main dish I had the Crispy Duck Breast. Pretty good it was a good thing I stay up the whole night after that dinner.",
        "Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "This is your typical Lebanese place that specializes in Shish Taouk, Shwarma among others.  It has a good number of tables for eating there with a outdoor patio for the warmer months.  Service is fast and to the point, exactly what you want at a fast food joint.  If you go for lunch expect a crowd.",
        "Fair price, privately owned with friendly service and they actually know what they are doing. This is a really good alternative to the chains.",
        "This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!",

I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",

        "Circus Circus has not changed much since 1995, except that the buffet is $15.95 now instead of $4.95 back then!  The decor is stuck in the 1980's and the rooms are, unfortunately worse, with wildly circus-themed decors.  Much better choices!",
        "Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.",
        "OK place, pleasant staff.  Average burger.  Better than the other big burger chains.  But not 5 Guys or In-N-Out",
        "This is my crafting paradise. Whether you are decorating, sewing, painting or whatever, this is the best place. It's so clean and neat. I never have a hard time finding what I want. The staff is friendly and they always have great sales here. You can even go online and download coupons.  I prefer this place over Michael's. Their prices and selection are way better.",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",
        "This is the cheapest place to stay on the strip, i dont consider circus circus or stratusphere the strip. It is alot of fun staying here.",
        "Home of the $1.50 burger!!! But their wings are really good, grilled or regular. Always a local crowd at the bar watching games on theor millions of screens. Bartenders are all very attentive, beer is cold. They have specials Tues and Wed.  LIke half price wings and tacos. No complaints. Nice, homey joint. Oh and they have a $3 breakfast!! For the morning after.",
        "Large portions, great quality, lots of options, Henderson location is awesome, the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome! \\nI would say that Pinkaow's traditional thai dishes are comparable to Lotus of Siam's and that they are simply just less busy.",
        "I brought in a pair of red suede Dolce Vita heels, with a rather large black scuff mark on the side of it, thinking there wasn't anything I could do to save them due to the color and material. However, Nerik proved me wrong and made them look almost brand new again. I was beyond impressed and completely satisfied with his work! I would highly recommend them for all your shoe and alteration needs! Thanks again Central Shoe Repair!",
        "This is a great place to grab a drink with friends. When it comes to there entrees, I would pass. I love fox restaurants food, but culinary dropout always has bad food.   Last time I had the fried chicken and it was horrible. The mashed potatoes tasted like it was from a microwave dinner or from a airline.\\n\\nFun place to drink not to eat.",
        "Have had the philly twice now.  It is pretty good. Not the best in town but up there.  Nice atmosphere with lots of screens for sports.  Get the onion rings, they are very good.",
        "Bomb food! Plain and simple! The pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and I love the chicken and Gorgonzola salad! Plus it's central to old town, walking distance from the clubs or the mall- major bonus",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "I am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick.",
        "My first time ever hearing of Rita's, but I am glad we stopped.\\nThe custard is kind of like soft serve ice cream but creamier (or more eggy, but in a good way).\\nThe staff was very friendly, and the Italian ice is really tasty with loads of revolving fun flavors.\\n\\nI came here twice in my week visit to Vegas and would for sure come again!",
        "After seeing all the other Cirque shows in Vegas first, I was a little let down by Mystere.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a good show.  It just can't compare side by side to \\\"O\\\" or \\\"Ka\\\" with their higher tech stages.  The performers were great but halfway through the show I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  See this first...then see the other shows.",
        "The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan",
        "ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!",
        "This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",
        "Stopped in for Sushi. Trendy atmosphere. Loud club music playing to pump you up as you eat. Classic Bruce Lee flick projected on wall is good for a few laughs. Sushi is fresh. Stuck with some of the more basic Maki rolls (Spicy Tuna, California). Both were on par with what you would expect from most Sushi restraunts. \\n\\nThe Sapporo Beer in 22oz can has an interesting steel shaped design to it.",
        "One of our FAVORITE places in Madison!  The best pizza in Madison, hands down. The crust, sauce and fresh toppings are all perfect, and the salads were fresh and delicious as well. (sylvetta salad was our favorite} The location always made it a great outing,located across from Trader Joe's and near Art Gecko.  We mill Pizza Brutta! This will be a spot we will not miss next time we are in Madison.",
        "Ended up here on a whim. We needed a dog friendly patio. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I had the street tacos with sea bass. Amazing! My husband had the bison burger with the kale salad. He loved it. The cocktails were fantastic. I wish Fox would open one here in Tucson.",
        "Candace is great! I live on the central coast in California and refuse to go to any salons here just because she's just that great! She can always get me in on short notice and out within the hour still looking 50x better than I did when I came in. great prices for amazing hair! what more could you ask for? pleasant experience all around and I definitely try to come in every time I'm in town",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "We had the Mini-Hot Pots with Seafood spread and Beef spread with tons of veggies and luckily there wasn't a wait when we came on the Friday evening. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Fruit-Fusion Green Tea, which was delicious and different than the green tea served at most other restaurants. \\n\\nThe Dipping sauce is probably my favorite of all time, where I could order a side of rice and devour it all!",
        "If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving. You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America. Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout.",
        "We were in Vegas for vacation and decided to check out this Aquarium store before we left. They had a few nice looking fish, but after seeing all the amazing sea-life at Caesar's and Mandalay Bay, it was not sensational. The salt-water fish seemed to be more interesting than the fresh water. The coolest thing about this store was their variety of sea anemones. They also had a large selection of new fish tanks.",
        "Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta.",
        "Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",
        "Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \\nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue.

Would definately go back.",

        "This is a food lovers paradise.  It was simply fantastic.  You can really tell they have a talented chef that cares about his food and wants to give you the best they can.  They deliver on that promise.  There is not a better restaurant in this area.",
        "The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore.",
        "Have to admit that I have not been to many clubs in Las Vegas. However, we decided to check it out. We ended up waiting in line for two hours which soured my mood. Once we got in, the place was smaller than I expected and there was one dj on the stage. There were lots of asians and indians at this club. The dance floor was so crowded that I could hardly move. The outdoor area was also too small.  I think Tao is much better.",
        "Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \\nMy fave is the fruit tart.",
        "Great ambience, okay service, boring food. Food was typical \\\"fusion,\\\" heavy on the pseudo-Chinese influence, kind of like a Thai-inspired PF Chang's. Definitely not terrible but I won't go back.",
        "This is the best authentic Hawaiian BBQ in AZ.  Being from Hawaii it's as close to the local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii.  They need to have cucumber Kimchi on a much more regular basis though!  I tell the owners that all the time :).  Paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in Chandler.  I believe it's the only place in AZ that serves Meat Jun which is a staple of Hawaiian Korean BBQ.",
        "Excellent green curry and everything else was tasty. Portions are small... Location is so central and easy to find. Don't be scared by the strip mall appearance.",
        "I had an issue with plumbing and did needed it fixed that evening.  Service was quick (only had an hour window) an problem was fixed quickly.  I definitely recommend Freddy Fox Rooter",
        "This is a great option to Border Grill at Mandalay Bay. The food was decent and the prices were a bit lower than other places. It's a casual atmosphere with friendly service. I would surely go again for quick and cheap eats.",
        "Do you like being entertained by a knife-wielding Asian chef cooking at your table while you eat?  If this may sound interesting, grab a group of friends and check this place out.  Just don't expect the food to be stellar, and if you order sushi be prepared for less than average.  Benihana is a chain that specializes in a culinary circus type environment over anything else.",
        "Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.",
        "I was in Austin Tx last month for a long spa weekend at a well-known resort, but Nathan's 90 minute massage at n8 touch was better than anything id ever had.  i haven't been to the chiropractor there, but I'll definitely be going back to the facility as long as Nathan is there.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "This place is ridiculous! We have been waiting a half an hour for food in the drive through and no one has said anything to us. I don't care how good they say they are or how fresh the food is you should not have to wait in a drive through for a half hour. Forget what Food Network says this is definitely not Food Paradise. Avoid trying this place out \\n!!!!!",
        "Such a disappointment.  My wife and I are huge Beatles fans.  We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance.  This did not live up to expectation. There were three \\\"stunts\\\" that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that.  It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that.",
        "Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available.",
        "Drink service is fast. Sandwich/bagel service is so slow one wonders if they are getting stuff from other close Paradise bakery. Best to stop at copperheads instead.",
        "Its a great little bar, the bar staff are extremely knowledgeable about cocktails and can even mix you something not on the menu. The food is really good and very reasonable for the area.\\n\\nWhy did they have to build this place so close too the student accommodation? Fanny central.",
        "Feels dated with a hint of Ghetto. Low ceilings in rooms, reminds me of a better Circus Circus, with less ghettoness.",
        "I like this place. Every time I come there's a small line, even on opening night and the screens aren't bad. They give student discount except on the weekends. They always give military discounts so that's another reason why I like coming here. Oh, you also get free refills on popcorn too, so eat up!",
        "They ruined my wife's birthday dinner.  Very slow service.  My son's steak tasted like sand (freezer burn?).  The waitress said that they are getting new steaks next week.  My daughter and I had the chicken - Dry ... She had a \\\"creamed corn\\\" which means that the corn was in a \\\"biscuits and gravy sauce\\\".  My wife had the oriental chicken salad - it was ok.",
        "This place is definitely not the place I signed up with.  Every time I go there, there is some issue, and usually each person I talk to has a different solution.  There is a revolving door of managers and asst. managers that I can only assume were pulled straight out of high school, as in before they even finished.  They have no issue with changing policies on a whim and leaving you to deal with it.  What a way to run a business Massage Envy!",
        "Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \\\"home\\\", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service.",
        "This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt!  Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!!  The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!",
        "We grabbed dinner at the Streets of New York this evening, what a great meal.  I had the cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Fabulous!  We started with artichoke and spinach dip with flatbread appetizer and the bread sticks and marinera sauce, num.   Our server was so sweet and helpful--what a nice way to end a good day.",
        "Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them.",
        "I had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant.",
        "We love coming in two movies for the whole family for what it costs for a single ticket at AMC or Edwards.  The food is also reasonably priced not a gouge like the aforementioned chain theaters.  Do yourself a favor go see all you movies here !!",
        "had my Toyota truck' s water pump, transmission and radiator replaced last summer by this shop. thought the water pump might of been leaking and even though the wAIT was over 2 Hours long the new shop manager seem too perform all necessary tests to make sure it wasn't. so fAR SO GOOD.",
        "The only thing nice was that eating at Tao allowed us to get into the club for free and no waiting in line.  \\n\\nI had the salmon with udon & spinach which sounded great.  I had the salmon medium rare and it was as expected.  The udon was a little salty.  It was hard to hear people speaking with the club music bleeding over to the restaurant.  The service was pretty good and the overall menu had a pretty good selection of food.",
        "Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments",
        "Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF.",
        "When I purchased a used Dell from Foxetech Alex was great to work with.  I give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget.  He as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades.",
        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "I love Paradise Bakery.. I operate a small graphic design business and enjoy getting out of the office to work. Paradise Bakery is very accommodating.. they don't seem to mind when I spend a few hours there.. The staff has been awesome and the food is always excellent.",
        "This place is a wonderfull place to go to... inexpensive and very friendly bartenders and some sexy ones at that... woo hoo!!! Love the screens in there and the food is excellent!!!",
        "The veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good.  Great wine selection as well.  If you find yourself in Montreal this will be a wonderful treat.",
        "Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.",
        "Love this place... If your looking for something new gotta try the bulgogi tacos, fusion lettuce wraps and all the burritos are killer good!! I definitely recommend this place highly!! You won't be disappointed!"

        "Loved it.  Perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings.  Very fast service for a busy place.  Better than the place at Hilldale.",
        "The place was clean and bright. The portions/burgers were small but OK. My buddy had the Chicken Parmesan burger and though it was small - he raved about it. Specifically the sauce. The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \\\"Colorado cigarettes\\\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.",
        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "Been here a couple of times and the view is so awesome. \\n\\nThe club itself is gross- like San Jose downtown gross. I can't believe people buy tables here... I guess if you MUST fit in some hip hop into your Vegas trip this is the place to go, but you also get the same hip hop crowd.  The view in itself is worth 3 stars though.",
        "My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.",
        "This is a outdoor shopping area.  Great shops.  Beautiful spot to stop for brunch and then go shopping!!!  Great addition to Vegas to get away from the Strip!",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.",
        "I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.",
        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "Food was ok, Great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers",
        "The meatballs are amazing. The entrees are great. Interesting, delicious cocktails. Nice atmosphere. The service was good and the staff friendly. It's a great place for a date night or just a satisfying, delicious dinner.",
        "I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back.",
        "Great place for an after work drink and appetizers. Went Wednesday night for 1/2 bottle night. Try the meatballs and fried mozzarella, it's the best in town.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am  going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap.\\nDo not consider buying this....\\n\\n\\n'b",
        "Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!",
        "As usual these people go above and beyond today we showed up 20 minutes before they opened and took a chair outside to wait for opening the very delightful wait person came out side to greet us, I said I know your not open yet we'll just wait out here until your ready, he said no problem were ready do you want to dine here or inside ? We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",
        "This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.",
        "Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!",
        "I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.",
        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good. I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",
        "Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong.",
        "Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",
        "This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to. The koobideh was fantastic.",
        "Nice Hotel but Bad Casino...\\n\\n-the gambling floor is really small.\\n-they did not have food service at the pool but said they will soon, this was in March.\\n-tried to upsell me a better view of the fountain for 35 more a night, I didnt bite. i got the back side of the airport...Pist.\\n-for 20 bux more i could of stayed at Caesars Palace that weekend",
        "When I was kid, we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis. They have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly. \\n\\nThe hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable, its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience.",
        "I love this place! It's a great hang out on the strip. They have excellent service and great drinks :)",
        "I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",
        "Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.",
        "I have been coming to this salon for about 2 years and i have always been extremely happy with their work. My hairstylist, Valerie, is super. She is great to talk to while I'm getting my haircut and is really great at doing my hair. During the shampoo she does scalp massages with mint shampoo that relax even the most stressed person. If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "Always has great lunch specials.. Back rubs with every meal which was really weird but what the hell never had that at lunch.",
        "Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.",
        "They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...",
        "Not great but good.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "I LOVE MARATHONS!! Everything is fantastic. It always tastes the same which equals HEAVENLY... that's all I can say.",
        "I love Metta Yoga.  The instructors are so warm and helpful, and the other students too are not afraid to laugh and also help me \\\"get\\\" a pose.  Awesome vibes to this place.  I bought a package deal so I could come again after my first free class.",
        "Had breakfast here meeting my sister that I hadn't seen in years... Was a little worried at first with it being so busy ... Let's just say the wait was well worth it... The service by Donna the best ever and the whole entire staff was quick and listened to our needs thank you so much for making our breakfast experience amazing",
        "I'd give this place 5 stars based on the taste of food, because it's great. My favorite place out here so far. However this place loses a star because when you order for pick up, you get very little food. Disappointing for the price you pay. You almost want to eat in the restaurant every time because only then do do you get the amount of food you pay for.",
        "Great company to work with. Very professional and knowing the right technique about local search marketing and search engine optimization. \\n\\nThey really knows how to engage with audience and bring connection between customers and business. Highly recommend!",
        "The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.",
        "Went to Ventanos because a friend recommended it and we loved it! The wine was excellent, the bread had a good flavor, the food was delicious, and the view was amazing! I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too.",
        "Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service",
        "a favorite place to bring out-of-towners, this (bar-first, distillery-second) locale has a laid back vibe, delicious bevs and great service.  the menu is limited, but full of delightful options to enjoy.  and, the strong local focus of the establishment is a definite plus.",
        "After being disappointed repeatedly by other pizza shops in and around the neighborhood, I decided to give Pizza Amier a try.  Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!",
        "Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper.",
        "We went to Raceway Bar & Grill  it is kind of away from the town but it was a treat. Food and service great. Lots of collectables to see. Pizza was different but awesome.we would go back for sure. Rand the owner made the experience even better. Had an Amber beer which was great to.",
        "the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?",
        "Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.",
        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.",
        "Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",
        "This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.",
        "I have been to many threading salons throughout the city and this one by far is my absolute favorite. I've had many bad experiences and they were able to not only fix my eyebrows but have done an outstanding clean up every time. Both ladies do a great job in paying attention to detail and not rushing thru it. I live on the west side of town but it's worth the drive to have beautiful eyebrows!!",
        "We stay here but the bathroom door lock was broken.  The room was nice the hotel was big.  Alot of stuff to see but our view wasn't great because we were looking at the back side of the Hotel all we to check out was the room and parking.  We should of  ask for a view.",
        "Love the personal training sessions, classes and the friendly ambiance! Best way to get fit instead of a regular gym! Always leave here sweating and stronger!",
        "Great locations, forget the rest! It's old! I will not stay there again",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "Found the recommendation on yelp and decided to give it a try. Turned out to be a great choice. Had a great time here.",
        "This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \\n\\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\\n\\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \\n\\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree.",
        "The happy hour martinis are where it's at!! Had a few dirty martinis and got a bunch of apps. The place looks cool and the bar is made of ice. \\n\\nService was excellent! Bartenders, waitress, hostess. All A+++",
        "Great place for breakfast/brunch.  The Works Omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome.  Natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress.  Send her to Disney!",
        "Lisa gave me a great cut.  I am very fussy about my short hair.  At 60 years old I want a stylish haircut but not to look like I am trying to be 20.  Lisa found the perfect balance, a cute,fun cut, perfect for summer.  I've already scheduled another cut and highlights for later this summer.",
        "Large cake portions. Good selection of macaroons. But I thought the almond croissant was way too sweet. I love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and I couldn't even finish the small portion. The almond croissant from La Belle Terre was much much better.",
        "Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!",
        "My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!",
        "Fantastic.  One of the best eye doctors I have been to in years.  Very attentive, convenient, modern facilities. easy to speak with, spent plenty of time with me.  Highly recommend.",
        "Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch. I had the chicken and waffles today and it was the perfect balance of southern diner meets gourmet gravy with bacon maple syrup. I live around the corner... looking forward to going back.",
        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",
        "This is a great small restaurant, great service and food was delicious! Try the Full taco and it was amazing!",
        "Yum! First time having breakfast here. Great menu with combination of upscale dishes and standards. Large portions. Awesome porch. Bar service. Love how they converted this area landmark. Good happy hour. Solid food and service. So happy to have this restaurant/bar in this area!",
        "I'm a KSBS BBQ judge, so I'm a BBQ snob.  I really liked the flavor profiles of the food, it was all over cooked.  Mac-n - cheese was bomb.  I think they do better than what I had so I'll go back and try again.",
        "My husband and I love, love, love the pizza. It all comes down to the crust and sauce which are both hand made each day. We always get the same waiter to serve and knows what we want. Great for a weeknight meal.",
        "Great food. Outside heaters not working!!! Cold!!!",
        "Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus.",
        "First time...food was great...can't wait to go to a moes that's not at the airport!",
        "My husband said it very accurately: \\\"its a once in a lifetime experience.\\\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.  It seems to me that the sandwiches are not anything great once you look past its size.  I ate it with the fries and cole slaw, but I could have done without the fries.  It is just a filler.\\nThe atmosphere as fun and very casual.",
        "Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.",
        "Food is great! Service sucks!",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",
        "This was my home gym for a while. Until they switched up management. The place has fallen apart. Manager is rude. Machines are old. It's simply not kept up anymore. Sad because it WAS such a great gym, people were serious about working out there. If you live in the NW area take your money to lvac over the bridge, there is plenty room and equipment and cleaner.",
        "new remodel did them good.\\n\\nRooms smelled of smoke, even though it was non-smoking.  (room 1789)\\n\\nstaff were great though and the location is really good especially if you have a car.  Easy in/out of the strip area",
        "This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.",
        "This place by far had the most heavenly crepes I have ever eaten and they make it right in front of you! I love the chocolate fountain they displayed and this little gem was by far the best at our stay at the Bellagio. 2nd best is their breakfast buffet lol\\n\\nI also had coconut macaroons and madelines as gifts and the receivers said they were great as well!",
        "This place isn't worth your time. There are FAR better bowling venues in town.\\n\\nSo what's wrong with Arsenal Bowling? Rude staff. Slow bar with limited selection. It's cramped and dirty. Lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7. Misleading specials (other have posted about this).\\n\\nI try to be an easy-going guy, but after trying this place a few times I'm done giving it another chance.",
        "Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\\n\\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \\n\\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "We went for an event the other night and WOW best food in town, seriously!!! They serve 4 dif salads all FABULOUS, 4 did piazzas 'to die for' & 4 dif pastas all Fantastic, my fav was angle hair pasta with Tomatoe sauce, I'm going back SOON!! Y'all should go TODAY!!!",
        "I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!",

        "Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol",

        "Take and bake sign was small and hard to see, out of towers , talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it, the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities, but staff was no help, very poor questioner service.",

        "The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",

        "When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",

The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

        "Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza. Pizza was just okay. I've had better pizza from chain delivery franchises.  My friends were disappointed and apologetic. Obviously, I won't be back, but neither will they.",
        "After reading all the negative comments about their customer service I was apprehensive going in there this afternoon. But I've shopped at their London and Swiss stores and love the brand. I must admit all those fears came to naught. All the girls were very helpful. Especially the girl in the changing area. She helped me diligently for the almost 2 hrs I was there. All the staff were most helpful and prompt in checking for sizes. Great experience overall!",

He discovered this little mistake when he walked into a room with undergarments thrown all over the place. \\nThe most irritating aspect is they did nothing make up for all the mistakes.",
        "I bought a travel zoo voucher for Cravings at the Mirage and so glad I did.  The quantity of choices are slim - compared to other buffets around town but the quality of food was very good.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the desserts.  I felt it could have been better.",
        "This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \\nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",

OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",
        "Great food until 2 am. Really healthy (and other) options in Vegas basically when you want them is pretty impressive. Everything I tried was great (salads, juices, wraps), and this is my second trip back. Worth a regular trip even when I'm in town as a tourist for late-night munchies.",
        "Everything I have read about this place has been accurate. This popular restaurant boosts a farm fresh feel with creativity and excellent service. My wife and I had the smoked salmon hash and every bite indeed tasted fresh and made to order. You had to wait a bit longer but the wait is worth it. The serving sizes are very generous and you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Come early it fills up quick!",
        "This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..",
        "This place sells... Yup, you guessed it! Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on.",

        "Interior can certainly be modernized, however the food is solid. I'm not a fan of paying to sub hash browns and a english muffin for fruit. Seeing as how I am now paying more for less food. All in all, US Egg is a solid stop in spot every now and then. One of those resturants you're glad that exists, but you'll never take anyone there to show them.",

The best pigouts will always be after beach club when you don't care about how your body looks like anymore haha  With that being said, the lengua fries have definitely won my heart here.  Actually, lengua anything here is good with me.  People always get grossed out when I tell them I like lengua because it's basically tongue, but IT IS SO BOMB.  JUST TRY IT!",
        "Killer place in Mesa to get your munch on with your furry friends!\\nThe patio rawks (love the misters), and they allow smoking outside (yay!) - deal with it! Mitch's Mushroom served with sweet potato fries is the sammie of my dreams, and the bar kicks out a mean snakebite!!\\n\\nThanks guys, we'll see you soon!",
        "This is not a bad place for lunch. I ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken, cheese, salsa, onions, sour cream and parsley. It is very similar to Chipotle, however I still like Chipotle better. \\n\\nThey have a couple windows seats that has a god street view, making it an ideal spot to people watch.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",

I can't say enough good things about this gym.  If you are contemplating joining a cross-fit gym, I highly recommend.",
        "Steak was about average.  Pecan salad tasted chemically and not worth the dollar up charge.  Sweet potato was mushy.  I asked for just butter not the extra stuff.  She brought out butter and said, \\\"I put the cinnamon in thought you would like it.\\\"  So it was so so.",

We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.  \\n\\nI would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again.",
        "Service was good. Clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down. They were different sizes and flavors. I also wouldn't order the crab legs.  They were pretty average. There is a dish (called roasted crab with sauce?) that is very good.  I would recommend that and the chowders.",

I'll be moving here next month and will update my review with a new one once I've settled in.",

        "I love the huge beer selection, cheap yet delicious food. It's great! \\n\\nMy favorites are the beef stew, the daily mussels special!\\n\\nHowever.. I must say the wait is LONGGGGGGGG for food, so don't ever come here on an empty stomach! And, it is definitely not a place for chatting, you get deaf after a while from the shouting!",
        "No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade.",
        "I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.",
        "We were really excited to order from the new pizza place in our neighborhood, however, when we called tonight, the girl who answered the phone acted downright irritated that we called.  I mean, really really irritated.  Not even halfway through the call I was already tired of the attitude, so I decided to hang up.  This household doesnt support business that act like they dont want our business. MANAGER  That girl needs a serious talking to in regards to customer service.",
        "Yeah it's a bit pricey but I feel the money is well spent on staying healthy. The facilities are phenomenal and that staff knows me by name.\\n\\nIt is really only crowed around 5PM on weeknights. Crowded but you still don't have to wait for cardo machines.\\n\\nSuper clean, new machines, great location, friendly staff.",
        "Awesome old-school style & good food. Usually busy, but the wait isn't generally long. Great staff and you can expect to pay from about $30. to 50.00 / person, depending on what you want. The salad, bread, table wine & a cappuccino to top things off are included in the main course price. Worth the walk.",
        "Highly recommend! Never been to one of these places. Eric is a very nice and professional.  Great value 20.00 for hour massage, very peaceful, relaxing and clean. \\nTreat yourself and support local business!"

        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "As usual these people go above and beyond today we showed up 20 minutes before they opened and took a chair outside to wait for opening the very delightful wait person came out side to greet us, I said I know your not open yet we'll just wait out here until your ready, he said no problem were ready do you want to dine here or inside ? We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",
        "Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.",
        "Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.",
        "When I was kid, we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis. They have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly. \\n\\nThe hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable, its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience.",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!",
        "The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though.",
        "Had breakfast here meeting my sister that I hadn't seen in years... Was a little worried at first with it being so busy ... Let's just say the wait was well worth it... The service by Donna the best ever and the whole entire staff was quick and listened to our needs thank you so much for making our breakfast experience amazing",
        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "I have been to many threading salons throughout the city and this one by far is my absolute favorite. I've had many bad experiences and they were able to not only fix my eyebrows but have done an outstanding clean up every time. Both ladies do a great job in paying attention to detail and not rushing thru it. I live on the west side of town but it's worth the drive to have beautiful eyebrows!!",
        "I had ordered gift baskets for my family in Phoenix several times from this store. My last order ensured that I will never do it again. The wine and cheese basket I sent for my sister's birthday never arrived. When I finally got a hold of someone who could explain, he told me that someone spaced it. I also received a couple half-assed apologies. Awful customer service.",
        "Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus.",
        "HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \\n\\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \\n\\nThe music, however, was cool.",
        "A buffet of average. Everything is okay, nothing is bad, but for bellagio you'd expect a little more. It's not expensive relative to other buffets but it's not cheap either. They seem to have conceded to being average, and they shouldn't have.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.",
        "In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was.",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Seriously?!?  You really don't want me to spend my money here... Ok...  the most od aweful service I have ever received in a retail store in my life.   They literally turned a few hundred dollars worth of sales I was about to make out the door.  I will NEVER go back here again.",
        "The worst place to buy cigarettes do not shop here the owner is a nasty human being. They think they are doing you a favor by you shopping in its store. If you enjoy being treated like crap and yelled at than  shop here because you get plenty of abuse here.  And for some strange reason they always want you to pay in cash",
        "So the family would like me to start off by saying wouldn't it be nice if the servers smiled at least once. Oh yes and why are they so stingy with the butter. Oh and when did they change their menu. \\nI guess we shouldn't expect good things to remain good forever, but we can dream. We used to enjoy The Good Egg but now......well.....meh. Wish we still liked it but, no.",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",
        "By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\\n\\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different.",
        "Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.",

        "Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)\\n\\nI had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)",
        "I love Harold's. I have never been able to go there at night because I have two small children. So, all I can comment on is the food quality. I LOVE it! Everything has been good. From the pizza to the roast beef. Its a great place to go, especially with a child in their terrible twos.",

        "Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.",

        "This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "I went here for breakfast daily when I was on vacation because of the reasonable prices so that I was able to do some damage at the steakhouses at night!\\n\\nDon't forget to get your patronage card stamped because after a certain amount I think you get a free one.\\n\\nThe service was good and the food was Ok but its really hard to mess up breakfast.",

        "RUDE,RUDE,RUDE is all I can say about this place. If you want to be treated like dirt, this is the place for you. I went in there ro shop and rexeived the worst customer service I have ever receives anywhere. Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",

        "My wife and I came here several years ago and loved the place.  We decided to stop by again and what a mistake it was.  The food selection was very limited.  The taste was ok.  I was anticipating to have lobster tail but apparently they did away with it.  We were disappointed.   One good thing, there was no line.  We were seated immediately on a Saturday night for dinner.",
        "I liked Lago but I didn't love it.  I think it had something to do with their selection which is no where neat the size of Le Village Buffet in Paris.  The food that I did have was very good.  I was there for breakfast and the omelet station was appreciated.  I would be willing to return if I were walking through Caesar's and hunger hit me -- especially during breakfast time.",

The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "Im not the biggest fan of this store.  The diapers and everyday items seem to be a lot more expensive here.   We did buy some bigger ticket items like a car seat, and a few other things.  Some of the kids seats and bean bags they have were very dirty and almost looked used while they kept their overpriced new price on them.   It seems hit or miss if you get an employee that is happy to be there or not.  Not a big fan of this store",

I realize this place is just a coffee shop but I never expected they would serve a steak that had been tenderized with papaya enzymes.  seriously gross.  the crab cake was ok but the best part was the remoulade.  also had a chopped salad that wasn't bad but it was over dressed.",

        "first off i am not a fan of this place at all. There are various places in charlotte with the same set up doing it way better.

        "We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down.",

When our bagels took a little longer than expected we were offered 2 more drinks on the house (generous and unexpected!) - the flat white is top quality.\\n\\nEverything looks like it'd be just as good.

Crispy rice was good but rediculously expensive (I think $14 or 16 for 4 pieces??)  The sea bass tasted like rubber and there wasnt much of it.  I'm used to high prices being from nyc...but I expect the food to be good.  Very dissapointed.",
        "The pepperoni breadstick fondue was amazing and so we're the drinks I had. The mac and cheese burger was not as outstanding as I would have expected especially since it claimed to win some kind of award. And at nearly $20 for the burger alone, it was pretty pricey. All in all, I'd come back for the apps and drinks, but that's about it.",
        "Nice venue, comfortable seats.  It was funny, not side splitting. There were more \\\"games\\\" that the group did, and not a lot based in audience suggestion. I would have appreciated the \\\"improv\\\" more if there was more of it. Much of what was done could have easily been performed previously and passed off as \\\"improv\\\". \\nIt was nice to experience something different, and it is good to see more options for entertainment in Charlotte.",
        "Dr. Weiner is awesome! He put me at ease about my surgery and now I'm able to breathe through my nose. He is very knowledgable and explained everything in terms I could follow. The office staff at this location  on the other hand is not very friendly. They were as helpful as people at the DMV! I would suggest going to one if the other locations!"

I cannot accept whatever java dung I was served with my all you can eat pancakes.  I'm sorry America this is a deal breaker.  I was good with your diner food  but what was poured in my coffee cup tasted like a dry roasted turd.",

        "I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back.",

I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",

When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item.

        "I'd give this place 5 stars based on the taste of food, because it's great. My favorite place out here so far. However this place loses a star because when you order for pick up, you get very little food. Disappointing for the price you pay. You almost want to eat in the restaurant every time because only then do do you get the amount of food you pay for.",

Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!",

        "Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch. I had the chicken and waffles today and it was the perfect balance of southern diner meets gourmet gravy with bacon maple syrup. I live around the corner... looking forward to going back.",

        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",

        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",
        "This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.",
        "This place isn't worth your time. There are FAR better bowling venues in town.\\n\\nSo what's wrong with Arsenal Bowling? Rude staff. Slow bar with limited selection. It's cramped and dirty. Lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7. Misleading specials (other have posted about this).\\n\\nI try to be an easy-going guy, but after trying this place a few times I'm done giving it another chance.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \\nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "I gave this sushi place a try, since it's around Summerlin(where I live). It was a to-go order. The sushi were not well made. They rolls don't look presentable. One of the rolls I got is a salmon roll. To my surprise, the salmon is cooked not fresh.",
        "We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!",
        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Pros: Very fun and friendly, energetic employees. Delicious drinks. Smoothies for the kiddos. I love going to this place.\\nCons: Poor location. The parking lot is congested so it makes the one line very long and challenging to get through as they sometimes stack people in two lines and try to get them to merge into one.",
        "Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.",
        "The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.",
        "Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food.",
        "Staff nice, but forgetful. The food was cold and bland. Wish I had checked them out here first. No wonder no one was in there.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!",
        "Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \\\"No Meat March,\\\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",
        "Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The \\\"Jimmy the Attorney\\\" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the \\\"food safe\\\" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Besides pizzerias, this is one of our favorite kid friendly places to eat while in Mesa, AZ. The burgers, fries and shakes just hit the spot (like In n Out back home). The seating situation at this location is way better than the location in Mesa, AZ.",
        "Ordered take out. Best potato salad I've EVER had!! The crab cakes were delish and the corn bread was a perfect accompaniment. I also enjoyed the brown rice as well as the pasta. Can't wait to get back here and try more stuff!!",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "So freaking good. Sangria amazing! Escargots delicious, onion soup amazing, scallops I could eat all day! Fresh bread at the table still warm!!! I love this place!",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "If it is supposed to be locals night on monday don't ask me for cover. Its an alright lounge but I am not paying cover for the right to purchase over priced drinks. I left they can keep their liquor on the shelves\\n\\nI have been there before its a nice view but not worth the hassle.",
        "Had some tamales, and they were one of the worst I have ever had! There is no way this place is the best in town? Now I am not condemning this place, I will come back and give them another try. I will try something different and maybe I might change my mind. But I just don't get the hype!",
        "When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "Dumpy supermarket.  Try another one.  Also, don't hang around after dark.  Gets creepy in this section of town.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "So we decided to give this place a try since we live near by. We ordered the mixed salad platter which had way too much garlic and lemon. Also ordered some shish kabob which was way overcooked and was like rubber. Leaving aggravated and unhappy I would have to say that I would not be coming back here again.",
        "Wow talk about outstanding food and service. This place knows how to top both. My Family and I ate here Wednesday We had such great service \\\"Carlos M\\\" it being our first time eatting  there he was very helpfull on answering our qwestions and offering sudjustions. He was always right there filling our drinks checking on how everything was.",
        "Great place! Everyone was so nice!! My 2 yr old is usually a nightmare in the chair. But after a rough few minutes (and a different movie) he was great. It was like a miracle. And his haircut is adorable. They did a great job. Would definitely recommend it.",
        "Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)\\n\\nI had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)",
        "Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \\\"is that all\\\". The first time she did it I said \\\"let me finish\\\" the second time I said \\\"I need to speak with a manager\\\" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",

The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.

The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",

Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "Nasty Nasty nasty.  All I can say is the garlic bread is good.  The spagetti I had tasted better straight from a can!  Don't forget to bus your table when leaving and leave a tip?  Why?  \\n\\nIt's sad, but on yelp the two categories that get my attention to yelp are the worst and the best.  This by far falls in the worst category.",
        "Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\\n\\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality.",
        "When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!",
        "One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.",
        "Stayed here in 2009\\nBesides a roach being in our room and the staff providing us with spray so that we could handle the problem ourselves; it was a nice stay. The staff overall was kind and helpful and the resort was very close to the strip.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "The NY-NY is a solid casino / hotel. The rooms are usually moderately priced and can be quite nice. There is a decent selection of casual and fine dining. And there are some great bars. The spa, salon, and pool, however, definitely leave something to be desired. And I can't say that I'm much of a fan of the latest makeover. But, all in all, it's a good place to stay and play.",
        "Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.",
        "Quick food.  Not surprisingly it tastes like a chain",
        "Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area.",
        "Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza. Pizza was just okay. I've had better pizza from chain delivery franchises.  My friends were disappointed and apologetic. Obviously, I won't be back, but neither will they.",
        "VERY OVER RATED!   SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend.  Charges for in room frig and internet.  Many other extra fees.  OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Pi\\u00f1a Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.",
        "very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun.",
        "This is simply a Holiday Inn in disguise- don't expect anything more (except the flat screen haha) and you will not be disappointed.",
        "Very family oriented.... Which is disappointing for our group with no children. Needs an adult only pool, needs more adult oriented activities. Beer or wine tasting? Very small gym. Buildings are awkwardly set up. Had to walk down a hall literally the length of a football field to get to our room, no stair access from first floor. Rooms were very nice though. Very large bathrooms and great patio space. Grills for cooking outside are super clean.",
        "Do not even stay here. The worst treatment I have ever received. Unbelievable! The spa is terrible as is everything else. Honestly, the Wynn came highly recommended and it was the worst experience in a hotel ever. 10% of the people were nice and the other 90% were absolutely horrible and disgraceful. It does not even deserve 1 star.",
        "Kind of a long drive from the heart of town but the casino is nice and clean.  You won't smell like smoke when you leave.  Decent machines and dining options.  The spa is nice.  I am a local so I have never stayed in their rooms.  The lattes from Baby Cakes are super.   Great sports book too.",
        "I fell in LOVE with this place so much that I went back the next day to try more food and cocktails!\\nI LOVE the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing!",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",
        "A very nice place to stay.  Friendly people.  Clean and comfortable.  My only complaint was the hidden resort fee to cover the \\\"free\\\" wi-fi.  I realize it's Vegas which is the land of deception, but I guess I expected more from a Merriott.  \\nThat being said, it was worth the money even after I had to pay the hidden resort fee.",
        "Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess.",
        "I'm not sure what I love more - the food or the ambiance. Jean Phillipe is such a fun place to visit just to look around; they even boast the world's largest chocolate fountain. My favorite thing to eat is the banana foster crepe.  \\n\\nTrying to find seating in the cafe is nearly impossible so just grab your food, make a left and grab a seat near the window overlooking the pool area.",
        "\\\"Good, Good, and.....GOOD!\\\" I always come for the cocktails and Thai Chicken Wraps. Service is good and I like the atmosphere, but some advice, \\\"Get there nice and early for seating on a weekend\\\".",
        "For downtown this was a great experience.  Free parking, nice friendly staff were everywhere for whatever question you had.   NIce pool and water slide too.",
        "Very good foie gras and pork belly over rice.  Price is decent compares to San Francisco.  Great service located in a unique location.  Reservation yes.  Great cocktail and sake menu.  For sure not for kids.  I will come back .",
        "I'm definitely a fan of The Groves.  You can bring your dog and relax outside.  A main reason I go is to see the server, Levi.  He is so friendly and funny.  He makes you feel like you are visiting his home and you have been friends forever.  I recommend the buffalo chicken salad.",
        "I love this place for 1 reason and that is the staff!! I enjoyed going to Mermaids and sitting at the back bar talking to a bartender named Raquel. She was the reason why I came to this place so often. I recently stopped by there and found out she no longer works there and was bummed out. She was super friendly and always served me and my friends with a friendly smile.",
        "My husband and I had finally decided to have a date since my son was born(which is now 20 months old). We thought we deserve it and we want to have a romantic breakfast. I had the french toast and he got the croque madame. Both were delicious. I'm not a coffee person but we ordered coffee for our drinks. Coffee was delicious!",
        "Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!",
        "Went to try it today at lunch and it wasn't open.  Went to Carly's Bistro instead (fantastic!).  Called the number for Scratch when I got back to the office and it was disconnected.  Guess it's closed?",
        "Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\\n\\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.",
        "I'll be back!  It smells like old vegas and I love it.  Friendly dealers, plenty of old slots; I hate the new ones; and my friend got regular cocktail service, even at a 15 cent slot machine!  I think the only thing that slowed him was his liver recouperating from the previous casino",
        "your spa and salon looking stops here! I was very impressed with the wonderful massage that Janelle performed and how professional Anne, nail tech was! this was by far the best experience i have ever had at a spa! i will be definitely returning! highly recommend!",
        "Avoid. It reminds me of a Hometown Buffet chain. The food is plentiful as is the selection, and some of the items are good. But the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria. It looks old and run down, and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever.",
        "This is where I usually go when visiting downtown. The atmosphere is great. I think its what makes this place. Its dark with a fireplaces and brick walls. There is also a dance floor and dj in the back. Last time I got a pretty rude bartender though. Only negative thing I have to say.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "It's a chain restaurant what do you expect? ..... Chips and salsa to go... Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start",
        "Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.",
        "Good portions and cocktails overall. The best thing I tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer. Stay away from the curry chicken, it was small and didn't have much chicken in it.",
        "There are many bigger and better Harris Teeter locations in Charlotte, but if you live in Plaza Midwood or NoDa, this one is your best option. Unfortunately, the produce there isn't great. And the location is pretty small. It's packed and frustrating around 6 pm, when everyone is getting off work and stopping there to buy groceries. I will say, the VIC card rewards are pretty good. You get good deals, and I got free luggage once through the program.",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \\\"Sammy\\\" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \\\"I'll be with you in a moment\\\" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying.",
        "Had to meet a client here for a quick cocktail before dinner. Being in the Four Seasons, it's a very quiet location; perfect for uninterrupted discussions. The service was excellent; our waiter was constantly available without being a nuisance.",
        "Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!",
        "Vey clean place a bit pricy but if you don't mind go there great experience I felt like a princess I got a gel manicure white tips with glitter cost 42 dollars. Good job on my real nails but on my broken nails I asked  for a fake nail over it the lady didn't do so good on those they looked really fat and fake but they blend in well with my other nails. Overall good job!!",
        "I'll keep it short, nice hotel for the price and great pool area. Close to all the good stuff.",
        "Finally found a great Vegas hotel that suits our family need - It's very spacious, comfortable, nice Jacuzzi, great indoor/outdoor pool, non-smoking, and Quiet at night. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of some casinos, but it provided true comfort and luxury. If I have to complain about something, their food selection is very limited. We go out to stripe for food.",
        "Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.",
        "This p;ace is just AWESOME.  The smell, the action, the excitement, the food, the POOL!  All there, and reachable by a free tram from Excalibur.  It's, by far, one of the top 3 casinos in Vegas.",
        "i am not sure why there would be any review higher than 1.  ppl giving this place a good review must not had a decent buffet before.  everything we had was super salty.  the prime rib was raw, and all the fruits there are from cans.  the only things that were ok were the shrimp cocktails and the salad.  my friend had stomach sickness the same night after dining here.",
        "Great hotel, awesome casino, fab room service!  We always book a suite in the gold tower and everything is always wonderful here!  My husband got us a cabana on this months visit and it was the best experience at a pool I ever had, could have been that u have to pay to enter that top level so only a limited amount is allowed and under sixteen not allowed either.  YAY!\\nWill always love staying here!  Best place to stay downtown.",
        "I'm not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews, but this is above average in terms of food.  However, the atmosphere is lacking in comparision.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall.  If you want something different than a chain, you may want to consider it.",
        "This is my first Korean spa experience, and I loved it. My favorites are the red clay ball room, the red clay dome room, and the ice room. This is a great experience if you just want to go somewhere away from the strip and relax. I will definitely visit again the next time I am in Vegas. Highly recommend.",
        "Stale bread, water glass unrefilled.  Stuffed mushrooms undistinguished.  Bolognese spagetti sauce with no depth.  Portions large.  No reason to go back.",
        "I had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off! I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water!!! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!",
        "Decent prices.  $21 for 2 huge sandwiches.  felt like boa constrictors as we left.  Reuben sandwich was good on terrific rye.  Fries excellent!  Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "Typical jack in the box.  Clean.  Staff is friendly.  Drive thru open 24 hours.  They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.\\n\\nPersonal favorites include:\\negg nog shake during the holiday season\\ntacos\\nultimate cheeseburger",
        "What kind of mystery meat do they put in these wrinkly giant hot dogs? Actually, I don't want to know, but it filled me up for $2.\\n\\nAnd you (blackjack) people who constantly double down when the dealer is showing 10 and you have 10...I'm going to choke you.",
        "The girls are beautiful!!! Bartenders & waitresses are AMAZING.. The DJ's are great... This place is FUN... The drink specials are always good... \\n\\nDON'T EAT THERE.... The cook is dirty... don't get me wrong the food is great... But don't eat if Chef Rudy is cooking he's dirty he does dirty nasty to the food..",
        "A Vegas MUST if it is your first time. Romantic and inspiring.. the jets shoot so high into the air, it is amazing! \\n\\nThere is a bar inside the Bellagio.. Fontaine that has a great terrace to view from and if you are wanting to fine dine with a view of them, it is Picasso!",
        "Great service... Very attentive. My wife and I interviewed numerous DJs before we met and immediately hired DJ Shai for our wedding. You can trust him to incorporate the musical and themes you want as well as keep the party going.",
        "Looks and feel like 99c store, or $1 store with prices higher than at Macy's. You have to crawl between shelves. Do not go, do not waste your time.",
        "New Carly's. No tuna. Menu change & Carly's removed the tuna. Sorry but as that was my fav sandwich, I won't be back. Bummer. Less options other than chicken & beef. New menu letdown. Boo. Dislike.",
        "Just off the strip, and miles away from \\\"the strip\\\".\\nIf you want real food, real people and real Vegas spend and evening at Carluccio's.  The food is delicious, the portions are generious and the service is warm and comfortable.  Don't waste your time walking through another casino to get some half warmed over chain style \\\"italian\\\".  \\nOh, and the price!?! PERFECT.",
        "The burgers are as good as one could hope for the price and the setting sure makes for good conversation. I like the fact that it's not a chain fast food place, but its missing some beer variety (i.e. other than Molson/Labbatt) and the fries could really be improved.",
        "Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \\n\\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down.",
        "Here for dinner with my family.  We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort.  Nice location, casual dining.  Good menu with choices.  Service was OK, food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party.  Overall, OK experience.",
        "Family fun!  Located conveniently close to my neighborhood.  There is no better place to spend the summertime in Las Vegas than in water.  My 4 1/2 year old daughter loves the kid area,  and all the smaller slides,  but is tall enough to ride on a lot of the bigger slides as well.  The best part is the Lazy River,  Wave Pool, and sunshine.",
        "I don't get why this place is so overrated.  I even came here twice to try and trick myself into liking it.  The food is nasty, really!  Mexican food cooked with the mystery asian meat....Is it chicken, horse, or cat?\\n\\nWho knows really.  The food has a very bland taste, don't waste your time.",
        "JT (bartender/manager) killed it! Good music and beer, badass cocktails custom made by JT and a little bit of food to snack on...will be back :)",
        "Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie.",
        "An older pool that could use some repairs and new lounge furniture.  It doesn't have the pizazz of some of the other places on the strip, but at least it isn't too crowded!  It does take FOREVER to get there from the hotel rooms, which was a pain.  Oh, and there's a lovely view of the Parking Garage...",
        "I was here for my 21st birthday. It was a lot of fun, but it was rather small. It felt like they were double their max capacity. The dj was awesome, but again the dance floor was too small and crowded :(",
        "Blueberry Hill Family restaurant Decatur has gone WAYYYY down hill, the food quality is atrocious, the prices absolutely outrageous, and the specials are never available when you want one.  The last time we went it was at 6pm and they \\\"claimed\\\" to be OUT of the special only an hour into their dinner service?  Methinks not.  Never again will we attempt to dine at this establishment.",
        "I love this resort and this bar is no exception!  Beautiful decor, great service and excellent drink selections!",
        "I really enjoyed my mani-pedi at A Touch of Las Vegas Day Spa. Norma took great care of me with pleasant conversation and attention to detail. Their treatment was wonderful and very relaxing. It was nice to get away from the strip for a while to really relax. The atmosphere was very nice and they seemed to treat everyone as an upscale client. When we visit again, I will definitely book a trip to A Touch of Las Vegas.",
        "I think they just put lipstick on a pig. Was in the casino floor for an hour and was not offered a drink. The casino area is very small. It seems they didnt have money to spend on the parking elevators.  Also believe is not handicap friendly when it comes to spacing everything is cramped and is difficult to manuver.\\n\\nThe guys at vallet were very courteous.",
        "We ordered unbelievable sauteed brussel sprouts, sauteed mushroom, \\nseriously outstanding Beef Wellington & steak, unbeatable cappuccino.\\nGreat service, and romantic booth seat upstairs.\\nWell worth spending every penny in a special night here :)\\nBest meal EVER!",
        "First time in Denny's visiting Vegas from NYC. Hmmm NO Avoid this chain. Can we say extra extra Butter on everything including the butter? lol Yea no never again...",
        "Checkin was slow.  Booked through a third party and the substantial $28 resort fee was not transparent as it should have been.  I guess \\\"resort fee\\\" is not included in taxes and fees?  Room is ok.  It is a long ways off strip, and if you don't have a car, expect to pay $15 to $20 to get to the Strip.  The shuttle is not very convenient.  Room looked mostly clean.",
        "Decent venue, well run, drinks are about what you'd expect. Overall you need to go when there is a good DJ, we had some second rate DJs who aren't local, but aren't good. It was a fun time, but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it.",
        "Pool is in major need of renovation! Bugs everywhere in pool too. Very filthy.",
        "This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain."

And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location",
        "Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "This place isn't worth your time. There are FAR better bowling venues in town.\\n\\nSo what's wrong with Arsenal Bowling? Rude staff. Slow bar with limited selection. It's cramped and dirty. Lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7. Misleading specials (other have posted about this).\\n\\nI try to be an easy-going guy, but after trying this place a few times I'm done giving it another chance.",

        "This place is way overrated. They hook you with their one signature item (a glorified Mocha Ice Blended from Coffee Bean) and get you for their overpriced basic menu items.

It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",

        "Just don't bother.  Sub par food, slow service, and over priced.  Go to Einstein's of you want a decent bagel that isn't dry and bland.   Even after the request to toast my bagel it was still cold.  You also have to spend your own cream cheese.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",

I went in there ro shop and rexeived the worst customer service I have ever receives anywhere. Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.",

I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else",

I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",

Also would be nice if beverage service would continue after 4 oclock.  Course was packed play was slow and no beverage service.  Called in but pro shop phones shut off at 4 30 .  No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30.",

        "Don't want to be mean but this place sucked slow service I've only been twice and each time it took them 15 min to make my chia tea and this time drink is not good taste like all milk   All the girls stood around while the slow man making the drinks took forever. I won't be going back to this place sadly",

        "Service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun.  Asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat.  Also, the place was super hot.  Everyone at our table was sweating.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but I wouldn't go back to this place after this experience.",

        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",

We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd.",
        "Good quality food. The eggs are fresh, and received order quickly. Service was a little slow, but coffee was good.",

        "gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.\\n\\ni dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area.",

        "Needed a place to practice hitting. Otherwise I'd have found another place. Not enough room in the slow pitch cage to allow for a full swing. Thankful I had someone with me to pull the net away. Definitely not worth $25 for an hour of pitches. Two stars only because it's indoors.",
        "Used to love this place, wonderful food, but went today at lunch and what a disappointment.  One poor guy behind the counter trying to assemble meals with no help, and so slow.  Had the smoked chicken sandwich, mac & cheese and coleslaw.  The chicken was just ordinary, mac & cheese was soupy and tasteless and the coleslaw was not seasoned at all.  Maybe new management as the choice of meals is much less than previously.  What a shame.",

And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.",
        "The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\\n\\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it.",

        "I'll be back!  It smells like old vegas and I love it.  Friendly dealers, plenty of old slots; I hate the new ones; and my friend got regular cocktail service, even at a 15 cent slot machine!  I think the only thing that slowed him was his liver recouperating from the previous casino",
        "I'm originally from Southern California where you can get some GREAT tacos - This place reminds me of all the great tacos along the beach area in So Cal.  Highly recommend it - some of the best tacos in Vegas.  I've tried every taco on the menu - all fantastic!",

I have been coming here for over a year and it is worth every penny.",

        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "Avoid. It reminds me of a Hometown Buffet chain. The food is plentiful as is the selection, and some of the items are good. But the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria. It looks old and run down, and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever.",
        "Good ambient and waiters are friendly.\\nBeen a soon of a Portuguese family I was a little disappointed with the Black Cod I ordered, missing a little taste and definitely not enough sides available.\\nWould give another 1/2* if was available.",
        "Ate here because we were at THE Hotel.  The restaurant is right in the lobby nicely done in dark wood and with a view of the passing Vegas crowd.   We had lunch and it was very well done.   The service was a little slow but if I was there I would go back.",

        "We really wanted to like this place given the other reviews, but came away very disappointed. Service was slow, but they were busy so that wasn't a big deal. While the Crab puffs were great, the entries were just too sugary (both Mongolian beef and Vegetable Lo Mein). We have never tasted any Chinese food that sweet (other than something like Orange chicken). Maybe it was just an off night?",
        "There are many bigger and better Harris Teeter locations in Charlotte, but if you live in Plaza Midwood or NoDa, this one is your best option. Unfortunately, the produce there isn't great. And the location is pretty small. It's packed and frustrating around 6 pm, when everyone is getting off work and stopping there to buy groceries. I will say, the VIC card rewards are pretty good. You get good deals, and I got free luggage once through the program.",

        "Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.",

Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a \\\"thatta boy\\\".  Not one negative.",
        "I go here because it's close.\\n\\nYellowtail collar is strong. Fish is fresh. Only thing I don't like is that the rice falls apart too easily.

        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\\n\\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.",
        "Burrito Drive almost single-handedly saves deilvery food in Madison from boredom and closing too early.  The food is fresh and hand-made, easy to customize and not what you'd expect (and that sweet potato business is AMAZING!).  Delivery is usually very quick, accurate and friendly even at 2am.   \\n\\nI do wish it was a little less expensive, but I realize the value in paying more for fresh and hand-made and delivered to my door.",

        "went here for the first time & I have to say I was satisfied with their food. we ordered the chicken & beef bulgogi and grilled saury, they were all really delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars for the food & atmosphere alone, but I had to take one star off for slow service & some dishes on the menu are a bit over priced.",
        "I ordered the 4 pc fried chicken (I think it was $5.29). It came with fries and a couple rolls. The chicken was ok. The fries were too salty.

Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",
        "went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.",

        "The food was good ... the service at this location is HORRIBLE. They are slow never check in with your table and take forever to bring something once you ask for it.

        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",

Servers all appeared overwhelmed and less than friendly. Not acceptable for upscale Scottsdale establishment on a Friday night. Good management appears to be lacking and it's a shame as this location has all the ingredients to be 4-5 stars consistently.",

        "Prices are steep! Macaroons are NYC prices except in NYC they are twice the size. These are samplers size. Overall they taste okay not special by any means. One of those places where you might want to try cause it is there. But probably won't miss it if you don't go back.",
        "Used to love this place, wonderful food, but went today at lunch and what a disappointment.  One poor guy behind the counter trying to assemble meals with no help, and so slow.  Had the smoked chicken sandwich, mac & cheese and coleslaw.  The chicken was just ordinary, mac & cheese was soupy and tasteless and the coleslaw was not seasoned at all.  Maybe new management as the choice of meals is much less than previously.  What a shame.",

I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.",
        "Loved this buffet! There was a fantastic spread at Spice Market. Although I do wish there was more variety in the Mexican section. The deserts were awesome! Overall we loved this buffet. We had two Groupons here but were only able to use one (the Lunch buffet with a bottle of wine). Staff was very friendly and attentive. We will totally come back to this spot next time we're in town!",

        "I usually love shopping at outlet malls. But St Jacobs Factory Outlet Mall is just so depressing.\\n\\nThere were hardly any bargains. And the stores and the merchandise were both so outdated. \\n\\nNot worth coming here for a special shopping trip but if you are in the area and have nothing better to do and outside is freezing cold.. then maybe.",
        "Pros - inexpensive, large portions, the cheese puffs or crab ragoon as we call them at home were awesome!! If I go back, that's the only thing I'll order.  These rice was not edible....\\n\\nCons - food was so/so; just average.  It was quick and easy.",
        "We really enjoyed this place.  We ate lunch here yesterday.  The Delmonico Steak Sandwich was really good, the homemade chips and the fries were also great!  My daughter had a grilled cheese and literally ate every bite.  My wife said the sweet tea was really good too.  The service was awesome.  I would definitely recommend it!",
        "I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!",
        "Usually I LOVE MC but today was NOT one of those tumes. Shepherds pie has too hot to eat..way too hot..the Caesar salad was filled with brown lettuce,  the dressing was sour and my pumpkin pie was burnt and tough. My server was nice but inattentive.  I was SO looking forward to eating here but spent way too much money on..well basically apathetic foid and service.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT",

The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house.\\nStick with small bakeries .",

Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.",
        "The flavors and toppings were okay.\\nI was a little disappointed how few non-fat options there were.\\nThey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes.",
        "Im not the biggest fan of this store.  The diapers and everyday items seem to be a lot more expensive here.   We did buy some bigger ticket items like a car seat, and a few other things.  Some of the kids seats and bean bags they have were very dirty and almost looked used while they kept their overpriced new price on them.   It seems hit or miss if you get an employee that is happy to be there or not.  Not a big fan of this store",
        "I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.",
        "I actually love everything about this place except one critical problem. The buns are probably the worst buns I know of anywhere. They are horrible, and they fall apart. I took the time to write the company, no response. I can walk there, love everything else, but cant go for a burger. sad",
        "Great place!\\nI've never had to wait very long for a walk-in, maybe 20 mins at most. \\nThe staff is friendly and does a great job.\\nPrices are consistent with similar salons.\\n\\nParking can be tough in this shopping center, but that isn't the fault of the salon.",
        "Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison.",
        "HOLY SH*T the bacon cheese rolls! amazballs!! good food and i liked the upscale atmosphere.  Nice place for a really expensive date night",
        "Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.\\n\\nAs a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, \\n\\nFood was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like.",
        "If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible.",
        "Beware! Place has become pretentious. Cover for women now and expensive drinks.",
        "One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.",
        "Vons gets 5 stars in my eyes. Store is always stocked with everything I am looking for, and let's be honest one of my worst pet peeves is driving to the store to hear grocer say that your item is out of stock! Also this place is open 24 hours a day!!!!! So you never have an excuse not to eat something healthy at 4a.m",
        "Not impressive.  Adequate service, but for the price the menu items lacked attention to detail. No guarana.  Feijoada is not very authentic.   Pao de queijo a bit heavy.  Meats were a little bland in flavor. Salad bar had good variety, though.  A little limited selection in the meats compared to other similar Brazilian steakhouses.",
        "Staff were nice and friendly when I came here but I wouldn't go again for food and as this one is more of a place to eat than drink (unlike the one on the High St) I really don't have any reason to try it again. \\n\\nI had the worst carbonara I've ever tasted. It reminded me of tinned macaroni which isn't the best either but at least it doesn't set you back seven pounds.",
        "WORST color &  cut job ive ever had! The color was spotchy, faded into a goldish color the very next week & the cut was un-even. I ended up having to go to someone else to fix her horrible attempt at  \\\"high lights\\\" !!!! The minute you sit down she is rushing you out of the door & she didnt even blow dry my hair all the way! DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR!!!",
        "Do not even stay here. The worst treatment I have ever received. Unbelievable! The spa is terrible as is everything else. Honestly, the Wynn came highly recommended and it was the worst experience in a hotel ever. 10% of the people were nice and the other 90% were absolutely horrible and disgraceful. It does not even deserve 1 star.",
        "If you are looking for a nice, stressfree getaway, I warn you not to stay at the Four Seasons Scottdale. The hospitality, communication skills (or lack their of) are by far the worst I've experienced in all of my travels. As I will get into details once I've checked into my next destination, i warn you at all costs not to stay at this hotel. It is by far the worst (what they call) luxury hotel experience.",
        "UGH!! A Wolfgang Puck Chinese restaurant. Need I say more? I hate PF Chang's and any restaurant(s) resembling it. \\n\\nTake a good look at the clientele and you'll get an idea what sort of food you're about to eat.\\n\\nExpensive and not good. Why would anyone even consider eating here?",
        "Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.",
        "Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible.",
        "This location is one of the worst! All the way from managment down, they nickel and dime me all the way!  I recommend avoiding this hertz location",
        "I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias.\\n\\nIn the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",
        "The 2 stars are for the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  Everything else here was just blah.  My friend and I split the crispy rice and the sea bass.  Crispy rice was good but rediculously expensive (I think $14 or 16 for 4 pieces??)  The sea bass tasted like rubber and there wasnt much of it.  I'm used to high prices being from nyc...but I expect the food to be good.  Very dissapointed.",
        "I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.",
        "Expensive. They Don't have the red bull sugar gumming bear.\\n\\nOnly cool thing is location.  One of places I stay when I go vegas.",
        "This place is located near the outlet center and is easy to access. In the store they provide you with packing tape if you need it. Unlike some other places that require that you purchase it. The customer service members are nice unlike USPS workers.",
        "I used to have lunch here all the time, the food for lunch is Ok! It has a huge buffet with a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese food. The sushi is good, the hibachi chicken is decent and the Chinese food is generic. For 10.95$ the variety is good for lunch however I would not recommend this place for dinner. It is very expensive and it has too much going on.",
        "The fish on the sushi gave my friend food poisoning. Worse part is the manager is literally watching you from the Cameras in the back. \\n\\nThe worst part is that if you order more of the same sushi they reduce the fish portion and increase the rice amount. I ONLY TASTED STICKY RISE!!!",
        "this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.",
        "Crap, bad food, overpriced, and the worst service. Didn't know such a mediocre restaurant could even exist at a 5 star property on the strip?! Ugh!!!",
        "Let's just say this place is terrible! I could go on and on about the multiple issues ive had with the poor customer service ive experienced but there's not enough time in the day. So instead I caution people to enter at their own risk. Polished is very happy to take your money but good luck if you are unhappy with their work, or worse, THEY make a mistake. Im citing management as some of the worst ive seen.",
        "Awesome place... a bit on the expensive side but all the food is very good and so are the sweets.",
        "Margaritas were made with store bought margarita mix. The chips were not fresh and they were out of a bag. There was no free chips/salsa refills. I ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, and it came out with only cheese and tasted very bland. Service was not only poor, but they were not pleasant. By far he worst \\\"Mexican\\\" restaurant I've ever been to, and I will not return.",
        "Subway needs to watch its back. Comparable prices, better quality, and outstanding selection put Which Wich ahead of the game. And might I recommend the Wicked?",
        "The bomb- awesome- just like the Beverly Hills place.\\nNot only is the food amazing- but they actually used alcohol\\nin there drinks  (unlike many places in Vegas)\\nWe went on a Thursday night- and the eye candy of \\\"available\\\"\\nwomen waiting for clients was mind boggling.  \\nAll the senses my senses were tickled at dinner.",
        "Great place for sandwiches and salads. It's a little expensive for sandwiches so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. But this place is definitely worth the splurge now and again!",
        "Great beer selection but way way way too expensive. $15 for two beers? Save your money and go elsewhere.",
        "The shrimp and grit here is great! The menu is a bit more expensive than similar style restaurants, but they do provide good food. It's a very laid back and wonderful atmosphere for personal or group dining. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area again.",
        "Gone so far downhill, they should just close this location. Had probably the worst Carne Asada Burrito any place in Vegas has ever served!\\nShould have been suspicious when it was ready in like 90 seconds. They worst re-overheated Leather Beef Jerky that I have ever tried to chew!\\n\\nAVOID THIS PLACE!",
        "I ordered a beef and cheese sandwich, which was forgettable. It was beefy, but flavorless. Considering that I have spent time in the East Coast, this in no way resembles hot sandwiches out there. I also found it to be on the expensive side. Their sides look interesting, but will sample them only if I'm in the area, which is right off the Meadows Mall and the 95.",
        "This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.",
        "Hopefully someone will put US Air out of its misery soon, as it has to be the worst airline (and I fly a lot - top FF level in United, Continental (both star alliance) and BA).  Traveling with family and they have a ton of seats available in coach but agent unwilling to change for a 4 year old and 7 year old...",
        "This place reminded me of Whiskey River without the shit kickers on the beach side and more of the laid back people. There were dance offs on the floor it seemed people were having fun. 99 cent Jaeger bombers and I heard 99 cent tacos or something. There was a wet t contest with only 3 contestants it was kinda sad but entertaining nonetheless. I'd probably go again.",
        "This is not a bad place for lunch. I ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken, cheese, salsa, onions, sour cream and parsley. It is very similar to Chipotle, however I still like Chipotle better. \\n\\nThey have a couple windows seats that has a god street view, making it an ideal spot to people watch.",
        "Stay away!!!! This AAA approved shop made me cancel my membership after the experience that I received from these guys.\\nThe worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Will not honor their warranty and will tow your vehicle if you try to dispute their work. Their service clerks are RUDE, unprofessional, and misinformed nit wits.",
        "The food is worth 4 stars but I took a star away because their hours suk.  They're closed Tues - Fri from 2:30-5pm. They're also closed on Sunday & Monday. Their food does taste authentic but it's on the more expensive side.  Their margaritas are pretty weak - they're poured from this pitcher that's refrigerated so they're not freshly made.",
        "Panama is a fancy Greek Restaurant. This is NOT a Casa Grecque type of Greek Restaurant. It is more expensive then other \\\"fast food Greek\\\" locations. However its worth the price. The garden salad is amazing. I had the lamb, and it was mouth watering delicious.\\n\\nThe staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is nicely decorated. I had a great time.",
        "This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business.",
        "Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\\n\\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\\n\\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.",
        "Worst Customer Service I have EVER recieved in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible. We got stuck in there over 3 hours. Our server was rude. Food was mediocre.",
        "Great place. Gotta have Nick as your chef. We had dinner real late and service was awesome. EveRything there is good from chicken to the lobster to the sake. You will have a great time. Just watch your wallet cause it can GET EXPENSIVE! LOL",
        "Compared to the other Starbucks around town this ones probably the worst, I know it's 100 degrees outside but when I order my Americano hot, I kinda expect it to be hot, last couple of times it's been cool like they iced it then noticed oops it's suppose to be hot, then strained and put into cup. Granted it's better than 7-11 coffee but When I go to Starbucks I expect better.",
        "way too expensive and their service is horrible it took me an hour and a half to get a cheese burger,never again",
        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",
        "The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!",
        "Worst customer service. They are so rude!  I go there because it is right down the street from my work. The cashiers are not friendly, the staff is not helpful and if you go there within 30 minutes of closing,  they are even more rude. If possible.",
        "For a brand new, upscale hotel like the Aria to open a POS club like this amazes me. Did they not see epic-ness going on at the Wynn/Encore? Maze features a bunch of space and a decent crowd but it is very unimpressive and lacks vision and creativity. Very disappointed in the caliber of this place but kudos for the nightclub security for taking care of our table.",
        "Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!",

        "Can i give this place zero stars?????  $85.00 for a \\\"Deluxe\\\" Pedicure and it was the worst, quickest, wambam thankyou mam pedicure.  Horrible!!!!!  They won't be getting another dime of my money.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.",
        "Stay as far away as possible. This place is a joke. Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. No one seems to know what's going on. No one feels it's there job to take responsibility, they always wanna pass the blame to everyone else. Avoid them at all cost!!!!!!",
        "Bar - expensive\\n\\nStaff - judging\\n\\nLocation - alright\\n\\nDecor - good\\n\\nwine -warm\\n\\nToilets - BAD BAD BAD",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "The worst most traumatizing customer service experience ever. I promised I would never put a foot there again even if coffee disappeared from earth and that would be the only place left.",
        "Too bad you have to select a star I wouldn't give them any!! Decided to try this place out worst decision ever.. They messed up everything we ordered. 3 phone calls and 2 deliveries later still didn't get what we ordered. Never again!!!"

        "A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside.",
        "Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring.",
        "Sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!",
        "This place is super. It's has great big windows and plenty smiles to go around. The staff is very helpful and the food was great. I had the sweet potato pancakes which rocked and tasted the biscuits gravy which were also way above par. The place is clean. Well staffed. Good food and near my house which makes it a 5 star place for me !",
        "Dear Montreal,\\n\\nThank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout).  Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen.  Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \\n\\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "It's nice to have this place close to Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian to load up on those essentials like snacks, water and sunscreen!\\n\\nAnother plus - it's clean and new.",

        "This is a small pharmacy with an incredibly knowledgeable staff that will go above and beyond. They check dating on OTC bottles and will save you money with their prices.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",

        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  The socially awkward cashier. Punch card is very specific to certain plates even if you're spending more. The random coin operated sticker/toy machine by the door.\\n\\nLIKE  The availability of low carb options. The Hawaiian music playing in the background. Choice of mini or regular size. Shrimp fried rice. Location close to work.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "I was working inside the Venetian and went here for dinner with work associates after a long day. They offer gluten free pasta. It was good and convenient. Nothing totally amazing. They have a good and extensive wine list. I also had a bloody mary here a different day and it was delicious (we had a hard time finding bloodys in Vegas).",
        "This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!",
        "Gag, they used an old bucket of water to wash down the inside, it reeked.  I had to drive home with the windows down.  Moldy old water and they wash the inside with that same rag for the tires.  Awful.  It's hard to find this place on the very South side of the shopping complex.  Skip it.",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",

I would have brought a lunch that day if I knew that I would be eating canned green beans, undercooked scalloped potatoes and cheap packaged rolls with \\\"whipped spread\\\". The little desert trays were good at least, and the staff was friendly enough, which is why I bumped it up to two stars.",
        "What a great dinner!  I had the pasta trio special.  They walk around with three pastas and just re-fill your plate.  I even wanted one of them without an ingredient,and they didn't bat an eye.  They even had the pasta prepared the same way to refill me!  I haven't been back, and I kick myself for it on my way out of town every time I visit there!",
        "What an amazing spot! They've got a huge beer selection with some on draft and most in bottles. Where else can you get live music with cheap beer? It is an old converted house and is hard to find. Supposedly they do that on purpose because they don't want to be flooded with people. That really makes no sense since it isn't on a busy street. However, this is probably one of the better spots I've been to in the Phoenix Metro Area.",

Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "Reviews are pretty much right on. Stiff drinks, good prices for happy hour. Appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips, served on Plastic plates. On par with what Dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint.",
        "Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.",
        "My friend and I went here in the late afternoon for a drink or two and a meal. We found the selection to be great but the service and food were lackluster. \\n\\nWe wanted to give this place a fair shot after hearing so many mixed reviews but it took several minutes before we had a staff member even acknowledge us. \\n\\nThis bottleshop could be a great hangout for group and friends a like but it's anything but.",
        "Our group got food poisoning from eating here. The service was great, but we got so sick afterwards we can never come back. \\n\\nStay AWAY! there are many other options for eating in the Venetian",
        "checkin/checkout is really slow and crowded with the huddled masses, public areas are very smokey, restaurants are over priced, wish we had stayed at the venetian.",
        "Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back.",
        "We went on a Friday for dinner and everything was excellent? The server recommended 3 plates each. We decided to split three which was a wise choice as they were huge! Great service and atmosphere we will definitely be back.",
        "This is not a bad place for lunch. I ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken, cheese, salsa, onions, sour cream and parsley. It is very similar to Chipotle, however I still like Chipotle better. \\n\\nThey have a couple windows seats that has a god street view, making it an ideal spot to people watch.",
        "While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!",
        "Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",
        "Yet again I had to go to this place and yet again I come up with the same question\\n\\\" WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SERVING WATER IN THOSE SMUDGY BOTTLES??\\\"\\nand YES! yet again i saw some floaters in my water....i would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!",
        "i am not sure why there would be any review higher than 1.  ppl giving this place a good review must not had a decent buffet before.  everything we had was super salty.  the prime rib was raw, and all the fruits there are from cans.  the only things that were ok were the shrimp cocktails and the salad.  my friend had stomach sickness the same night after dining here.",
        "This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\\n\\nI've always had good service here.",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!",
        "good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.",
        "Nice wooden, yet modern interior, with candles. Staff and guests come with a pleasant grungy edge. A whole page with veggie pasty, and even one vegan option. Vegan pasty? Yes! I stuck with a veggie option (rosemary 'chicken', good) to not rock the boat too much. Maybe vegan next time, it's intriguing.",
        "Since Sambalatte opened its doors in Summerlin, I became a huge fan! I LOVE their Nutella Latte and the variety of tea selections they have. This place makes you feel as if you were not even in Las Vegas! A great escape,awesome lattes...all at Sambalatte ...Goodbye Starbucks!",
        "I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.",
        "I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes.",
        "\\\"Too many diiiicks on the dance floor\\\" -my husbands take on 1oak\\n\\nPromoters told us free drinks for ladies, but only three ladies could enter the open bar area at a time and I swear it was just water in Skyy vodka bottles. Oh well!",
        "Food is very good, the owners are very friendly.  I would have given them a 5-star however it typically takes 10-20 minutes to get your food (and this is simple mexican food), secondly they don't have free chips & salsa.  Their Texax Burrito and the Al Pastor plate are both very good.",
        "Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and for the most part it was a good experience and good food. The service was good too. Waiter was very courteous and explained everything about themselves and the menu. We ordered the two cups of crab bisque which was good, oysters Rockefeller which I thought was ok, stone crab legs were good, crab cakes and lobster sole which was our main dishes were ok. Overall it was a good experience and service was good.",
        "Having stayed at there other property The Venetian I was anxious to try The Palazzo.\\nSince is newer the Venetian is seem cleaner and more modern.\\nGreat rooms\\nThe casino is a little smaller.\\nThe staff is fantastic.\\nBeautiful decor throughout The hotel, check in was a breeze.\\nI had such a good trip I stayed there again two weeks later and also had a great time.",
        "Fantastic! Bulgarian food is always delicious but these cooks go above and beyond to bring back childhood memories. I left feeling so satisfied! On top of all this the service was impeccable. \\nIf you are looking for fast food go somewhere else because all the food was made fresh right after you order. Perfect for socializing with friends around big plates of delicious memories!",
        "I went in for and met the Dr. very, very briefly. We decided not to do anything. I still got a bill. I don't recommend going here.",
        "I love their rice plates!! The chef also adds a little artistic touch to the food too!",
        "I wouldn't recommend going here. Apart from very poor service, the food wasn't really great. The only thing good on my plate were the fries. The lady who served us forgot a couple of our drink orders and when she finally did bring them to us, one of them had something floating in it.",
        "Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. \\n\\nNice low-key atmosphere.\\n\\nFood is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",
        "I have found my new go-to appliance service company. They came out the same day and fixed my Refrigerator in minutes all for the cost of the service call price of $55.",
        "A very nice hotel/casino to look at. I haven't stayed here before, although I ate at the Grand Lux cafe last year. Very good food, although pricey. I've also been to the wax museum located on the Venetian grounds. \\n\\nI thought that my honey and I would do the Gondola ride thing when we went to Vegas a few weeks ago, but boo at the 65 dollar price tag for us to ride alone. I think not!",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "I've been eating at The Golden Phoenix for as long as i can remember!   It is a family-owned restaurant, they are wonderful people, very friendly and their food is always great!! I usually only go for the dinner, Food isnt the only thing they do right!   Service is 5-stars. Clean as can be, and still looks like they just opened their doors!",
        "Good, average food. Not the greatest but it hits the spot. 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate up the road has some fancier dishes, a little more tasty, but you get what you expect here.",
        "I don't even want people to know about this place because I'll have to wait longer, but wowzers, amazing flavors.  The sides (or three) are the real stars here.  The fried brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were my favs.  The brisket was a little chewier than I'd like.  One of your sides can be these little dessert cups.  Delicious!",
        "Worst zoo I have been to. Not a good zoo if you have a big stroller. There were hills upon hills and it was way more exhausting than fun. There were doors in the kids exhibit that i could barely get my stroller through. \\n\\nThe playground was awful. Like some tunnels and nets. \\n\\nSecurity was super nice and helpful though. I had left my headlights on and they notified me :)",
        "Yes, the spaghetti is really that good.\\nNo exaggeration. (And I don't even like spaghetti that much.)\\n\\nRomantic. Make reservations in advance. Fairly quiet, so I liked it. Great view  of Bellagio fountains if you get a seat next to the window.\\n\\n(Same experience at the Scarpetta in Miami. The location in Miami is gorgeous.)",
        "The ambience and the setting is awsome but i expected a lot more from the food.  Came out slighlty on the cool side so by the time I was finishing my plate it was warm at best.  We had breakfast but i will be going back to try their lunch and dinner.",
        "Phenomenal BBQ! We had the brisket sandwich and the Smokin Plate. Everything exceeded our expectations. I'm only sorry that we don't live closer!",
        "What a HORRIBLE experience!  The dance floor was like a moshpit with angry, ugly people.  The lines at the bar were 5+ deep and not moving anywhere.  The layout makes it impossible to get from one area to another.\\n\\nThe ONLY upside is that on the outdoor patio there is a great view of the fountains at Bellegio and of the eiffel tower.",
        "I had the Pad See Ew.  It was pretty mediocre - too sweet, slight burnt taste and not very flavorful.  Food presentation was lousy, just dumped on the plate without garnish.  Service was indifferent, even though there were few customers.  There are much better and still authentic Thai restaurants in town.",
        "Food was semi ok and they didn't refresh the trays of food as often as they should've but I guess for the cheap price that's the quality you get",
        "Located at the front of the building, adjacent to casino. Windows look out on the water where the Fountains of Bellagio water show is performed.\\nTip: If you want window seating, make a reservation at least 24 hours in advance. \\nAmbiance was wonderful and decorator touches were in keeping with fine dining venue. Service was excellent. While the food was good, the quality did not match the prices. Having said that, this restaurant is the least expensive in Bellagio.",
        "Fun place and 5$ dollar pitchers during he week. Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls.",
        "Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.",
        "I love these fountains! I can sit there and watch them for hours.....They are beautiful and, even better, they are free! Can't beat it for sure.",
        "I just can't get pass eating off of Styrofoam or paper plates. It ruins any experience for me unless it's a picnic, BBQ, or at the beach. Otherwise, give me a plate and some silverware! I ordered the cheese enchiladas and the cheese was not melted. I did enjoy the shredded beef burrito I had to go the next day.",
        "Amena had really good service and have really good plates.They have great prices I recommend it.",
        "I love any place that is amenable to the small plate, which this place does. My date and I got to share all of our courses. All of the flavors here were excellent. The primary criticism of this place is that the dishes came out lukewarm. Everything we tasted was excellent but not necessarily hot. The biggest disappointment on that front was receiving lukewarm goug\\u00e8res. Bread products (like soup) should always be piping hot.",
        "The location is perfect, next doors to our dentist... and I think their chicken is awesome... the Spicy Honey Mustard and Asiago Parmesan... also MUST TRY.... their homemade Asiago Chips... nice!!!",
        "So dirty, super greasy menu. Dirty plates. Food was bad. Bad interior. Very bad overall experience. I'm just being honest.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "A traditional (dark wood and real ale) Edinburgh pub which offer a lot more than its dark interior suggests, for starters they serves up some surprisingly tasty food until midnight. Offerings include a selection of Buffalo burger, a hot pot special and normally a tasty homemade soup and while not the cheapest the food is well prepared and filling thus well worth the money.\\n\\nMy advice - check out the green mantle, have a few jars and something to eat, relax and enjoy.",
        "I love the Chicken kebab plate... it is awesome, the flavor, portion it's all there :)\\n\\nThey charge to use your card... I'm not a fan .. so I call for delivery when I have cash... for principal, they have very long delivery times like an hour... they say 20 min but it's an hour so call before your hungry....other than that pretty good."

        "Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!",
        "Awful sushi! Not friendly at all. The waitress had such a bad attitude. Never again. Not even for free!!!!!!",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "Went to Ventanos because a friend recommended it and we loved it! The wine was excellent, the bread had a good flavor, the food was delicious, and the view was amazing! I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too.",
        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game.",
        "Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper.",
        "Oh my goodness, so freaking good!  When we arrived the waitress told us all about the building and the restaurant.  We had a rather large group (10) and they were great with serving us.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would definitely go there again and again!",
        "Decent food. But.... I ordered an Irish coffee, and they gave me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey on the side. I asked the bartender if she knew how to make this simple drink. She said, \\\"we don't do that here\\\". Wow. I asked for the remaining ingredients, and I was charged for each individual ingredient. $17.00 Irish coffees at Brazwells. Condescending staff.",
        "The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location",
        "The happy hour martinis are where it's at!! Had a few dirty martinis and got a bunch of apps. The place looks cool and the bar is made of ice. \\n\\nService was excellent! Bartenders, waitress, hostess. All A+++",
        "Great place for breakfast/brunch.  The Works Omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome.  Natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress.  Send her to Disney!",

        "My husband and I love, love, love the pizza. It all comes down to the crust and sauce which are both hand made each day. We always get the same waiter to serve and knows what we want. Great for a weeknight meal.",
        "Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "This place by far had the most heavenly crepes I have ever eaten and they make it right in front of you! I love the chocolate fountain they displayed and this little gem was by far the best at our stay at the Bellagio. 2nd best is their breakfast buffet lol\\n\\nI also had coconut macaroons and madelines as gifts and the receivers said they were great as well!",
        "A buffet of average. Everything is okay, nothing is bad, but for bellagio you'd expect a little more. It's not expensive relative to other buffets but it's not cheap either. They seem to have conceded to being average, and they shouldn't have.",

Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...",
        "Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction.",
        "The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.",
        "Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",

Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.

Oh and when did they change their menu. \\nI guess we shouldn't expect good things to remain good forever, but we can dream. We used to enjoy The Good Egg but now......well.....meh. Wish we still liked it but, no.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",

Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",

        "I was really disappointed in this place after the consistent glowing reviews. I ordered the sweet crepes with bananas, my daughter got chicken fingers. Her food was very hot and mine was cold when it arrived. Waitress never came back to refill drinks until I got up to pay check. I just missed all the craze.... It's like an ihop to me",
        "OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\\n\\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\\n\\nRun away -",

The teachers are excellent and give a physical workout as well as a spiritual experience.  Northwest Yoga is a wonderful community that is unpretentious and where you quickly become family.  So glad I found it!",
        "Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back.",
        "The angry mushrooms were awesome, crab cakes were some of the best I've had in a while.  I didn't have any problems with the waitress, but the ladies in my party were not happy with the service.  Good food, good music...I'd go back for sure.",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "The lobster fajitas were amazing! $26. After reading the reviews about the service I was hesitant to try this place but our waiter Fab was awesome!  I'll be back to order the same & ask for Fab",
        "Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza. Pizza was just okay. I've had better pizza from chain delivery franchises.  My friends were disappointed and apologetic. Obviously, I won't be back, but neither will they.",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "Great quality food and the servers are really nice!",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful",
        "This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \\nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",
        "Since the Keg had an hour wait and I was with 2 grown men who were hungry, we came to Vieux-Port instead. Our waiter was too proud to be serving us, I really don't know how to say it, he never looked us while taking our order and was annoyed that we were even there! My salmon was well cooked, but extremely blend, my fiance's steak was apparently perfectly cooked.",
        "The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything.\\nFor example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver.\\nIf I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!",
        "The food was great. \\n\\nNice , little clean place.\\nThe menu lacks description , but I was able to ask the waiter about anything that sounded interesting. \\n\\nI will be back.",

        "The chips are fresh, so is the salsa, the food was just okay,  nothing that I would run back to! But the shrimp ceviche and the margaritas definitely would have me running back only during happy hour!\\nThe service was A1, everyone was very nice and friendly, especially my waiter Claudio!",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "Great place. BUT horrible service. Although it was a game day Sunday and it was full they only came by 2times to check if we were ok and needed something and every time we asked for something we got a different server!!!",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "I'd have no problem driving across town for one of their 'freezies'. Interested in knowing how I maintain my status as the \\\"most favored uncle\\\"?  Frequent visits with the kiddos to this place that's how.",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "I thought the food here was pretty good - cheap too. It started as an Ethiopian restaurant but the server told me that some Somalis bought it. The atmosphere was fine and they have a sitting room - see photo. The service was fine and the bathrooms were clean. My date enjoyed her Vegan meal and I enjoyed my beef dish. We left thoroughly satisfied - the portions were adequate. I would come here again. Celebrate Diversity! Solid!",
        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Pi\\u00f1a Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.",
        "The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area",
        "Where I lost most of my money but this review is for the horrible service I was provided. Sure, the Jabbawockeez show wasn't bad and Britney Spears sat a couple rows behind my sister but this place is so grungy and needs to keep up with the architecture. Come see me at the Bellagio!",
        "As a bar it's pretty decent. As for the food well... If you're going to prepare ALL your food in a microwave, can you at least hide it somewhere in the back. I would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos.",
        "The food is really good. However, the service could use some improvement. It felt like the server lacked people skills. Otherwise everything else was decent.",
        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "Very average-seafood was cold and not highest quality-for this price it should be great-and our server was goofy-and chauvanistic",
        "Our first visit. Sat on the patio and after 10 long minutes had to flag a server. If not for a time crunch my guest and I would have left. Servers all appeared overwhelmed and less than friendly. Not acceptable for upscale Scottsdale establishment on a Friday night. Good management appears to be lacking and it's a shame as this location has all the ingredients to be 4-5 stars consistently.",
        "This place was alright, just not what I was hoping for. The curry was a little too soupy for my liking. The customer service was great, we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately I don't think that would be enough for me to want to go back.",
        "Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",
        "All of their food is great. Servers always have an opinion on what you should try if you're indecisive, and they're always spot on! Bartenders are fun and always attentive, but not too in-your-face. Great place to catch dinner and/or drinks with friends or family!",
        "Went there for lunch yesterday, food was ok, service was lacking, server forgot our soup and fries, had to ask for them, never refilled my tea. Will not be going back.",
        "The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!",
        "Waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good. Service not so good. Had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up. Waitress didn't smile at all :(",
        "I would not return here again, it was very unclean, and the servers ignored us all night. The food was horrible, way try dry on the chana. I still love the indian place next them.",
        "I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.",
        "Love Love Love. There's not much to be said. If you make my coffee good I will love you forever. end of story.\\n\\nSuper fast service, clean quiet environment. They never make a mistake. I got free coffee from their drive through TWICE =-) because they said I waited too long. Thank you!!",
        "We were a party of six and ordered 9 items altogether And the food was good. But it took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. One hour before our main dishes appeared. We had to remind the waiter twice about the desserts.\\nWe were seated upstairs, which perhaps slows things down. But this place is not cheap and two hours for a Chinese dinner is absurd.",
        "We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.",
        "What happened?!!! Used to be the best now I'm editing my 5 star to a 1. Lost all care, quality, and pure taste. Staff fails. Bartenders are subpar. It's just not an enjoyable experience anymore. It's like the owners threw in the towel."

        "Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper.",
        "My husband said it very accurately: \\\"its a once in a lifetime experience.\\\"  We tried it because it was our first time in Pittsburg, but next time we visit we will pass.

It is just a filler.\\nThe atmosphere as fun and very casual.",

The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",

        "The food was, how to say this without offending, white people version of Mexican.  It was bland to the taste, overcooked and bland, and god forbid they make it themselves rather than pour it directly out of the can. It was edible, though slightly overpriced for what you get.",

I am coming back for certain",

Poor management..... we will never return",

Yesterday, I had gumbo that the seafood is already shell free so i could enjoy it without the hassle of a mess. It was delicious. Janet was my server: very nice as always. Nellie is my other favorite server. I also had the Pan Roast to go since it is my favorite dish. I always buy the FULL portions. The consistency here is great.",

If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club.

        "I recently had a quick bite to eat at this location.  My usual......Bean Burrito and 7 Layer Burrito.\\n\\nOrder was accurate.\\n\\nPlace was clean.\\n\\nFood was ok.\\n\\nIt's Taco Bell....not much to say.\\n\\nWill I return?  Sure.",
        "It may have taken me a few minutes to get my Il Purista, but upon the first bite it wouldn't have mattered if it took 3 hours and my first born child.  Defalco's has the honor to be my first favorite sandwich shop.  I have never been a huge sandwich fan, but with fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, tomatoes and enough panscetta to bring my tastebuds to climax, I am now.",
        "Love Honeybaked Hams... and their Turkey is excellent too!  \\nYou can even get sides for a complete and delicious meal!\\nOR... you can go for lunch and order a tasty sandwich and side.\\n\\nSuggestion... call ahead and order the size ham you want.... especially if you are ordering during holiday times.",
        "I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \\n\\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.",
        "YUM!  The whole meal I kept saying this is the kind of food I love!  Flavorful, Fresh and sooooooo YUMMMY!    We shared one appetizer with soft pretzels, sausage, cheese, etc- YUMM!  I had the pick 2-  Prosciutto and Brie and the Raspberry Chicken salad- again YUM!",
        "I love any place that is amenable to the small plate, which this place does. My date and I got to share all of our courses. All of the flavors here were excellent. The primary criticism of this place is that the dishes came out lukewarm. Everything we tasted was excellent but not necessarily hot. The biggest disappointment on that front was receiving lukewarm goug\\u00e8res. Bread products (like soup) should always be piping hot.",
        "Cappuccino was undrinkable. It was burnt and made me want to cry. I've found that some barristas at One Coffee Co. know what they're doing and others don't.",
        "Horrible. Dirty. Unfriendly valet and front desk people. Go anywhere else. Waste of money.",
        "Ate a chicken corn dog & fries from here yesterday. I've been sick ever since. Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever....definitely food poisoning of some kind. If you decide to go here make sure everything is cooked all the way through.",
        "Great selections of beer from the local micro brewery.  I only wish I had more time to eat. The menu offers a good selection of better than average airport food. Decent prices without gouging the travellers. Much appreciate the fast service, knowledgable staff, and beer descriptions.",
        "I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again",
        "Yogurt and Granola Yuck and Coffee sucks.  Along with their cappuccinos.  Otherwise , it is great.  Bagel and Lox are great and so is the Omelet.",
        "Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \\nMy fave is the fruit tart.",
        "Had issues over parking. I went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly. I will won't be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also.",
        "Great Food \\nFunky Atmosphere\\nFriendly Servers",
        "Gute Bagels zum Fr\\u00fchst\\u00fcck. Modernes Lokal und auch zwei Tische zum drau\\u00dfen sitzen. Sehr gut.",
        "This is one of my favorite Burlesque shows in Las Vegas. The performers, both local and out of town are excellent performers and always entertaining. Each month offers a new theme, and 3 times a year is the Student Teacher Showcase which highlights the students completion of the Burlesque 101 and the Solo Act Development courses. This is not a Strip Burlesque show, it's better and one to be seen",
        "An old style family restaurant.  A very good value for the money.  My entire group liked the food.  A little bit of everything for everyone.  We ate Greek food, they also have Italian.  Can not vouch for the Italian as we all ate Greek Food.",
        "Customer service!  Someone still has it this day in age!  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat!  To the employee who helped me:  Hats off to you good sir!",
        "Went here for dinner to celebrate a birthday and although the food was pretty good I have never had worse service at a restaurant in my life. The server/managers were very rude, condescending, and unprofessional. We were treated like we were a nuisance and as if our business did not matter to them. Even though the food was good I will not be returning back here due to the way we were treated. Very disappointed with the attitude the wait staff and management had.",
        "Every time I leave Vegas to go home, this is where I eat.\\n\\nFriendly restaurant for crepe lovers.  I try to find a crepe eatery every city I visit; this is my favorite for Vegas.",
        "The ambiance is very nice, it does have a good location but the food is not all that. My Salmon was on the dry side, the Arugula salad had no flavor, they just put cheese on it and the pork ribs were ok but not the greatest. It wouldnt be my first or second pick if where to eat again. Sorry guys! But the waitresses were very sweet n nice!",
        "Meh...some of the residents are dodgy and the apartments aren't that great, but you get what you pay for. I wish I had known the lay of the land a bit better before choosing this place. Great move in specials and the maintenance guys are pretty nice, but the office staff are condescending and generally unhelpful.  I'd keep searching if you're considering Indian Hills.",
        "Burgers and wings are good. But I enjoy this place because I love stopping in for a beer/wings after taking my dog on hikes. I like the dog friendly, but have encountered some unfriendly staff. I've seen some totally flat beers they bring out. Absolutely no head and no bubbles. I prefer bottles at this place that way I know what I'm getting. I'll be back, but only because of location and dog friendly.",
        "Prices are a bit steep (~$3 each for a small cup of hot chocolate and a small cup of cappuccino), but they're strong in taste.\\n\\nA good stop to make after visiting the basilica!",
        "I was so hopeful for a comeback....but it didn't happen\\n\\nAfter terrible service and great pizza last time we went, my wife and mother in law returned for lunch and had a terribly overcooked, dry and tasteless chicken parmigiana sandwich. They brought some home assuming I would eat anything but could not eat this.\\n\\nOff the radar for a while.",
        "Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast.",
        "Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.",
        "It was almost the end of the day and I was able to get out of work a little early so I called D'Lisa. She was able to book me almost immediately ( within 40 minutes ) although it was last minute notice and so late in the day. When I arrived she was ready for me and offered me something cold to drink. She professionally and painlessly waxed my brows to a perfect arch. I will be back, wonderful experience wonderful everything!    Thank you!!",
        "Need a NEW menu that describes what you are serving people!  Butter salad was all field greens with a couple pieces of butter lettuce.  Quinoa and bulgar wheat side dish was mostly arugula with a little quinoa.  Salmon was served dry and overcooked.  I had to cut it with a knife!  Noisy.  Came home hungry!",
        "if you're looking for customer service do not go to Bacchanal Buffet!  We hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 10:01 only to be turned away.  Absolutely no compassion!"

        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "Jim Barker, Debbie Wilson and Ashley Ford.  Avoid!  My loan went pass the date and the sellers are pissed and put in a 3 day cure notice.  Now they are asking for items that they should of asked for weeks ago.  I don't think they even open the Email that I sent them, unprofessional and I will probably lose this house and money because of there mistakes.  Process was the worst, thank God we got the house",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.",
        "I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though.",
        "This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.",
        "After being disappointed repeatedly by other pizza shops in and around the neighborhood, I decided to give Pizza Amier a try.  Two years later I am still ordering from Pizza Amier and I am never let down!!!  The pizza is great as are the wings, I usually don't stray too far from my usual.  When people ask me about where to get pizza in Squirrel Hill, this is the only place I recommend!!!",
        "Decent food. But.... I ordered an Irish coffee, and they gave me a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey on the side. I asked the bartender if she knew how to make this simple drink. She said, \\\"we don't do that here\\\". Wow. I asked for the remaining ingredients, and I was charged for each individual ingredient. $17.00 Irish coffees at Brazwells. Condescending staff.",
        "We stay here but the bathroom door lock was broken.  The room was nice the hotel was big.  Alot of stuff to see but our view wasn't great because we were looking at the back side of the Hotel all we to check out was the room and parking.  We should of  ask for a view.",
        "I moved here from Chicago in July of 2011. and  i have to say this was one the best movie theaters i have been to  in a very long time,  love the decor there, price are no higher than any other theater. i would recommend this place to anyone.",
        "Found this place after I moved to the Southwest a few years ago when it was the only thing in the area. Years later, even after new owners and a name change, it's still the only pizza I've needed. Good South Jersey style red pies and they have a very good white with ricotta as well.",
        "The Vegas meets Italy pizza is one of the best tasting pizzas in the neighborhood. Also the guys there really care about the food they sell and will gladly elaborate on any questions you might have. Go, eat, and be merry.",
        "Took my wife here last week with flu symptoms, it wasn't very busy but it still took about an hour and a half before we left. The wait time was okay considering there was only one doctor for the whole place. The nurse was not overly friendly as she asked all the questions that we already filled out on their forms. I suppose the establishment serves its purpose when you can't get in to see your primary care doctor.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment .",
        "My only place to go for Chinese food. Sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic, but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is! \\nThey have a fantastic tofu bowl (Hot and spicy bean curd) which is perfectly spiced! Others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed. \\nIf you're looking to be snooty about your Chinese food, go somewhere else. Otherwise this place is perfect.",
        "You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",

        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.",
        "If it is supposed to be locals night on monday don't ask me for cover. Its an alright lounge but I am not paying cover for the right to purchase over priced drinks. I left they can keep their liquor on the shelves\\n\\nI have been there before its a nice view but not worth the hassle.",

        "This place was so packed when i was here. Like everyone else says the dance floor really isnt big at all. EVERYWHERE, and i mean everywhere possible is reserved for bottle service. Lucky for me im a woman and flirted my way to a grey goose cran and a seat- i feel sorry for the guys!\\n\\nAdd 2 stars because the line was HUUUGE and we walked straight to the front and into the club.",
        "Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process. When their original diagnosis was wrong they went to option b and didn't charge me for the unneeded replacement. They usually very busy, but we'll worth any wait.",
        "Great food , the salmon was to die for.\\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter",
        "Terrible service over the phone. I could barely get my order out before the lady cut me off to ask me \\\"is that all\\\". The first time she did it I said \\\"let me finish\\\" the second time I said \\\"I need to speak with a manager\\\" she told me there weren't any managers available and hung up. Due to this experience I will not give my money to this business! So sad because its very close to my house.",

I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",
        "This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",

Better luck..",

Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care.",

        "I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.",

I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else",

That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",

I will be back Lemongrass!",

        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",

When I got there it was timeshare. And the gifts that they tey to give u that u dont come out of pocket u do pay for. They are liars and tricked us into  what turned out to be nothing they talked about!",

        "I had high hopes for this place when I decided to make reservations here for my fiance's birthday. We had walked past this place many times and always said we'd try it one day. The potatoes au gratin were delicious. Otherwise the rest of the food we ordered was all right, but nothing that I'll be dying to try again.",

        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "The food is really good. However, the service could use some improvement. It felt like the server lacked people skills. Otherwise everything else was decent.",
        "I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.",
        "Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking.",
        "WORST color &  cut job ive ever had! The color was spotchy, faded into a goldish color the very next week & the cut was un-even. I ended up having to go to someone else to fix her horrible attempt at  \\\"high lights\\\" !!!! The minute you sit down she is rushing you out of the door & she didnt even blow dry my hair all the way! DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR!!!",
        "Do not even stay here. The worst treatment I have ever received. Unbelievable! The spa is terrible as is everything else. Honestly, the Wynn came highly recommended and it was the worst experience in a hotel ever. 10% of the people were nice and the other 90% were absolutely horrible and disgraceful. It does not even deserve 1 star.",
        "Great customer service at this place.  Katie, our sales associate/customer rep was friendly and informed.  Our rangemaster, Jeremy, was extremely helpful and patient, and answered our numerous questions.  Excellent experience!",
        "Employees seemed completely out of it and confused by their jobs.  Asked what sandwich I wanted 3x after I told her.  Seemed to be really exhausted or on drugs. \\n\\n Coke machine was out of Coke but I wasn't about to wait an hour while they refilled it.\\n\\nOverall, a poor Subway.",
        "Service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun.  Asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat.  Also, the place was super hot.  Everyone at our table was sweating.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but I wouldn't go back to this place after this experience.",
        "Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.",
        "This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..",
        "Best choices for gluten free and dairy free at whole foods  but this location doesn't have as much in hot/cold bar options and isn't as nicely organized as others in town.  Half of the bulk buys were out of stock in both my trips. Will continue to go but to the other locations in town.",
        "A friend told me about this place after my regular hairstylist moved back to Canada. I was very impressed with Molly Rose! She did an awesome job with my cut and color. She is my new go-to-hair expert! I got tons of compliments after going to see her.",
        "Went there for lunch yesterday, food was ok, service was lacking, server forgot our soup and fries, had to ask for them, never refilled my tea. Will not be going back.",
        "What an amazing spot! They've got a huge beer selection with some on draft and most in bottles. Where else can you get live music with cheap beer? It is an old converted house and is hard to find. Supposedly they do that on purpose because they don't want to be flooded with people. That really makes no sense since it isn't on a busy street. However, this is probably one of the better spots I've been to in the Phoenix Metro Area.",
        "Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\\nGEEZ...",

        "This place is as bad to be expected! \\n\\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \\n\\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!",

        "I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was \\\"MOLE\\\" oh my!  I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized...",
        "Not pleased. Bad service, generic noodles and broth, and steep prices for pho. I waited to be seated at 2p on a Monday, then waited to order, and waited for a water refill despite empty tables throughout. I also asked for fried tofu but received steamed. Pass.",
        "Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.",
        "Great experience with Joseph Maridon, Jr..  He got my ticket changed to a parking violation and reduced fine!  He is very helpful and responsive to questions.  The process is easy through his website, especially since I don't live in Nevada.  Hopefully I'll never have to use his type of services again, but if I do, he'll be person I call."

        "The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service.",

It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back.",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",

The sand artist was really cool and different.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",

Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\\n\\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\\n\\nI would go back, but with low expectations.",

        "Not bad, but other nearby places offer better bang for the buck. Ugh- and the skinny white chair was extremely uncomfortable- not ideal for dining out. The seat of the chair had no padding and was too thin. A rethink of the chairs are a must and should be made an immediate priority.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00.

        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "A decent sandwich for a decent price. Not the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  Everything is \\u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to get here JUST for a sandwich, but if you are nearby it probably won't disappoint",

We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.",

I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",

The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "The food was excellent. Salsa had great flavor. It was a little hot for my son, so he mixed it with the mild tomatillo salsa. Cheese dip was great too! I had some kind of turkey carnitas taco on a whole wheat tortilla with bacon and avocado on it, DELICIOUS! Top shelf margarita was $10 tonight (Thurs) and well worth it! We will definitely go back!! So nice it is just 3 miles from home too.",
        "Pristine  cleaners at my house this week and my home is beautiful!  Prompt and friendly,  the cleaning was flawless and went beyond my expectations!",
        "I popped in to have a quick lunch and quite enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The salmon was cooked perfectly--a little extra pink in the middle. I am docking one star because I think my meal was a touch overpriced. $28 for 5 asparagus spears, a beer, about 7 oz salmon, and about a cup of grits. Seems like island prices to me! Was tasty though.",
        "Truly awful service and food!  Think of half the quality of Denny's food for three times the price!  I would never go back.  Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!  Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House.\\n\\nWayne Gorsek",
        "My crew boys swear by it, busy busy but fast service, not really my taste in food but it was well prepared and really generous portions.  Heaps of reice with lime, salas, guac, balbacoa and sour cream, in a burrito bowl, tasty.  Other offerings included burritos and salads with chicken beef and balbacoa.  Good fast food for $10.  Outside patio available",
        "I travel A LOT for work, and trust me, i've had some pretty raunchy tasting stuff, but this was just absolutely great.I ordered a pineapple flavored cone, and it was so absolutely friggin' flavorful!No it may not be too good for my diet...but it was totally worth, stop by this place, it's definitely worth a shot.Or in this case...a cone.",
        "Stopped in here on my way to Pink Taco. Way disappointed in their Gay/Lesbian book selections. 1 measly little shelf- NOTE: shelf, NOT bookcase...\\n\\nFuck that! How are the conservative AZ's gonna come outta the closet without a \\\"how-to\\\" manual?",
        "One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious.",
        "Super fast delivery, and really nice delivery guy.\\n\\nThe delivery portions were tiny for $11, and the pepper chicken was ridiculously spicy, and this is coming from someone who puts black pepper on everything. If you're going to add that much black pepper, balance it out with some lemon or lime, unless you like a mouthful of fire. The crispy spinach was good and sweet though.",
        "Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente"

        "I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part.",
        "I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",
        "a favorite place to bring out-of-towners, this (bar-first, distillery-second) locale has a laid back vibe, delicious bevs and great service.  the menu is limited, but full of delightful options to enjoy.  and, the strong local focus of the establishment is a definite plus.",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",
        "Came here on a Friday night to have a drink at the prohibition bar located in the casino. I was impressed by how the dealers and dancers in the middle of the floor never stopped shaking and bouncing. It really helped in keeping the energy up in the room. The tables were busy and so was the bar, but the service was still good. Additionally, their vallet is always super nice.",

Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay.",
        "My only place to go for Chinese food. Sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic, but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is! \\nThey have a fantastic tofu bowl (Hot and spicy bean curd) which is perfectly spiced! Others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed. \\nIf you're looking to be snooty about your Chinese food, go somewhere else. Otherwise this place is perfect.",
        "Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at, cursed at, watched ppl get punched, and had a very good cheeseburger at the same time. It was a lot of fun. The burger was really good for a grill & the homemade chips were off the charts! The grill was filled with men who enjoyed being yelled at by the female owner! Good times & good food! Don't take young kids",

        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",

Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",

        "Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained.",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",
        "Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \\n\\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20.",

        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",

        "I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",

        "This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",
        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "Great club. Diverse crowd including age. Mature place where you don't have to worry about a shooting or \\\"hood\\\" crowd. Very sexy and sophisticated place. Free vodka drinks. Call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines. If you can spare a few hundred between friends get a table. It's so worth it.",
        "I've been coming here for years and I believe the quality has been going down lately.  We never stay here, only on the strip and would make a trip just to eat their buffet.  The food is starting to taste like your typical buffet.  Nothing really special.  Same selection with subpar taste.  If you are a crab lover, then this is good for you since they serve both warm and cold carb legs.  Lines can be crazy so come early or late.",
        "The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.",
        "pretty amazing experience. Good seating, good acoustics, pretty much awesome all around. seats were comfortable and the security wasn't completely overbearing.",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "This place is just ok for me. The restaurant has a nice setting, good service, and nice entertainment. The food is good but not great for the price. The steaks were slightly over aged for my taste, au gratin potatoes were very tasty though. They have a nice wine list with many options for all budgets. Its worth a try if you are at gvr and looking for a nice meal but I prefer most of the steak houses on the strip over this place.",
        "Really really enjoyed watching this show. The music is just so dreamy and the theatre is so beautiful. I think we saw it some time last year, so this post is quite late. However, in any case, my love and I had an amazing time. Can't wait to go back to Vegas and see more shows!",
        "I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.",
        "Nice, big patio to enjoy a conversation and catch up with friends. The inside was clean and service was nice. All the pastries looked especially tasty at this location. Nice job.",

The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.\\n\\nThe line got long as we came out.",
        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",

        "I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both.",
        "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything.\\nFor example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver.\\nIf I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",

        "Are you kidding me with the salt?  Ordered the steak main course with side of fries.  Could not believe how salty it was....\\n\\nEnjoyed the oysters the most.  But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. \\n\\nToo much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back..",

        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",
        "Great little tacos on Fremont St. Carne Asada tacos and spanish rice were good. Cheep eats and open late!",

        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "I thought the food was pretty good. I have done alot of really good Tapas and this was just pretty good. These guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is. Too busy for me on the weekends I would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it won't be soon.",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Great food until 2 am. Really healthy (and other) options in Vegas basically when you want them is pretty impressive. Everything I tried was great (salads, juices, wraps), and this is my second trip back. Worth a regular trip even when I'm in town as a tourist for late-night munchies.",
        "Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!",

        "Everything I have read about this place has been accurate. This popular restaurant boosts a farm fresh feel with creativity and excellent service. My wife and I had the smoked salmon hash and every bite indeed tasted fresh and made to order. You had to wait a bit longer but the wait is worth it. The serving sizes are very generous and you won't leave hungry or disappointed. Come early it fills up quick!",
        "Horrible bland food. Horrible service, but a sweet girl. TVs were waaaay too loud -only 30 people in the huge place, the loud volume was not necessary. Table was dirty. We'll never go back.",

It is cheap, filling, and very tasty.",

        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "There are some things that are a cardinal sin of a 24/7 Diner Restaurant...I can accept Farmer Brothers Coffee (or whatever your low grade Joe happens to be).  I cannot accept whatever java dung I was served with my all you can eat pancakes.  I'm sorry America this is a deal breaker.  I was good with your diner food  but what was poured in my coffee cup tasted like a dry roasted turd.",
        "They get one star for cleanliness and decor. Aside from that, the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu.",
        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "I go there all the time. I went almost every viet restaurant around the neighborhood and this place the best. Cheap and high quality food. Try pho combo and u wont regret it. Open 24/7/365 and always clean and serve good food. They give good amount of bean sprouts too. Highly recommended.",
        "I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back.",
        "It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing.",
        "As usual these people go above and beyond today we showed up 20 minutes before they opened and took a chair outside to wait for opening the very delightful wait person came out side to greet us, I said I know your not open yet we'll just wait out here until your ready, he said no problem were ready do you want to dine here or inside ? We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",
        "I am a loyal customer and love the place! The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!",
        "Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.",
        "I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.",
        "One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!",
        "This is a good Gap outlet at times.  Normally, we come out of this store empty-handed because the prices were too high.  The last couple of times, though, we have found some good bargains in there clearance section.\\n\\nThe store is clean and organized.  The employees are okay.",
        "BRUNCH: Went there for brunch once and it was eeally OK. We couldn't even get a clean glass of water. Imagine! And the food was good but nothing \\\"woah\\\" about it. In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer.\\n\\nI will give it a try for dinner. Let's hope this time it will be less disappointing.",
        "Pretty good yogurt and toppings.  Always clean and staff is pleasant.",
        "the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",
        "I have been to many threading salons throughout the city and this one by far is my absolute favorite. I've had many bad experiences and they were able to not only fix my eyebrows but have done an outstanding clean up every time. Both ladies do a great job in paying attention to detail and not rushing thru it. I live on the west side of town but it's worth the drive to have beautiful eyebrows!!",
        "3.5 Stars\\n\\nThis is my weekly grocery stop.  This Fry's location is clean and in the process of a remodel.  The deli carries Boar's Head meats which are my favorite!  Their fried chicken is so good.  The non-food items are generally more expensive than the evil super corporate mega grocery store.  Fry's will also multiply your coupons up to $1.",
        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",
        "Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \\n\\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance.",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "This place is super. It's has great big windows and plenty smiles to go around. The staff is very helpful and the food was great. I had the sweet potato pancakes which rocked and tasted the biscuits gravy which were also way above par. The place is clean. Well staffed. Good food and near my house which makes it a 5 star place for me !",
        "Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...",
        "It's nice to have this place close to Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian to load up on those essentials like snacks, water and sunscreen!\\n\\nAnother plus - it's clean and new.",
        "Big, clean, carries lots of variety. Some is overpriced, the rest is about average.",
        "We us AZ Sunrays for Gymnastics and Dance...and I couldn't be happier!\\n\\nMy daughter is constantly asking when we are going again!\\n\\nStaff - friendly and want to teach their technique.\\nFacility - clean\\nClasses - engaging for the kids!",
        "The worst place to buy cigarettes do not shop here the owner is a nasty human being. They think they are doing you a favor by you shopping in its store. If you enjoy being treated like crap and yelled at than  shop here because you get plenty of abuse here.  And for some strange reason they always want you to pay in cash",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.",
        "Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. \\nBreakfast is ok, but not more. \\nService is friendly. \\nNo twin rooms available..",
        "Nasty Nasty nasty.  All I can say is the garlic bread is good.  The spagetti I had tasted better straight from a can!  Don't forget to bus your table when leaving and leave a tip?  Why?  \\n\\nIt's sad, but on yelp the two categories that get my attention to yelp are the worst and the best.  This by far falls in the worst category.",
        "A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",
        "Walked around for a while and found Jason's deli.  Place was clean and I tried their reuben sandwich today.  I give the Reuben 4 stars for taste.",
        "Poor service, lack of cleanliness, and unbelievably bad food.. A one star is too high of a rating! No second chance deserved here - no way we will be back.",
        "Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\\n\\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\\n\\nI would go back, but with low expectations.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "Nice little shop. They are pretty clean and organized, but my fella did have a little trouble when he purchased a game and realized they gave him the old version only after getting home already. We went back and exchanged it for the correct version with no hassle.",
        "Nice place, nice atmosphere, and I've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre. I'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist, 'heavy' bread, which I'm sure some people love. I've just discovered Wildflower Bread Company and their bread is 'perfect' for me - drier, lighter, but still with moisture and 'stretch' or 'bite'.",
        "Nice clean grounds...always feel at home here.",
        "I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",
        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",
        "Everything was good with the food. While still finishing up with food, a lady came up to us and said :\\\" we have a reservation pn this table.Is there anything that I can do to help you move along?\\\". It was surprising because the place was empty. Another recommendation would have been to move us.",
        "Just don't bother.  Sub par food, slow service, and over priced.  Go to Einstein's of you want a decent bagel that isn't dry and bland.   Even after the request to toast my bagel it was still cold.  You also have to spend your own cream cheese.",
        "Place was not good. Food taste bland and it is way over priced for what you get. Orange chicken was nasty and so was the fried rice. Won't be coming back here.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",
        "Great club. Diverse crowd including age. Mature place where you don't have to worry about a shooting or \\\"hood\\\" crowd. Very sexy and sophisticated place. Free vodka drinks. Call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines. If you can spare a few hundred between friends get a table. It's so worth it.",
        "Nasty.   Bad food.  Rude,  indifferent staff.  1 star is being generous.",
        "My son went and got us subs for dinner last night.   I had the JJBLT.   Not good.   The bacon had an odd taste, and, despite my request for \\\"Crispy\\\", it was soggy.   I ended up eating a lettuce, mayo and tomato sandwich.  Disappointing consumption of calories.",
        "Yum! This place is good! \\n\\nNice and clean, interesting variety with nutrition info included for each flavor! \\n\\nMy daughter is super picky with her toppings and this place is a winner. Price is right, too. Will be back.",
        "The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\\n\\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",
        "I put in an order for pick up. My food was ready on time and my order was correct even with my modifications. This is not a 5 star restaurant, but it was 5 stars for what it is!",
        "royal mile is beautiful, it's a lovely cobbled street that runs on a hill with pubs and shops and restaurants on either side. when it's empty it's great to walk down and when it's really busy during the festival with people advertising their plays it's even more awesome. i love it.",
        "The meat department is one of the best I've found.  The marinated meats are not overly salty.  My family loves the pork carne al pastor and marinated flap steak.  \\n\\nThe store is small but clean and the staff are always willing to help.  The select is limited due but what I've bought has all been good quality.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care.",
        "I had to get the carpets cleaned in the house I was moving out of and my neighbor referred me to these guys. All I can say is if you want to deal with true professionals, not the typical Las Vegas service company, call Noble. \\nThey were on time, polite, professional and most importantly did a great job. \\nWhen its time to get the carpets cleaned at my new place, I know exactly who I will be calling!",
        "The food is really, really good but the service is horrifically slow.  If you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare.",
        "Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.",
        "Nice, big patio to enjoy a conversation and catch up with friends. The inside was clean and service was nice. All the pastries looked especially tasty at this location. Nice job.",
        "We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful",
        "Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!",
        "Sam met me at the service area, checked in my vehicle for its appointment and got me a curtesy vehicle. I was excite to get my car back clean and ready to go.",
        "This is your one-stop Chinese takeout shop!  Hunan park never disappoints, and they always have your order ready super quick.  I highly recommend the general tsao's chicken.  If you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own. Overall, solid across the board!",
        "Dr. Cruz is a very good physician.  She actually touches you and listens to what you are telling her and tries to get you to the right diagnostic testing or specialist.  I have enjoyed having her as my physician and my family's physician.  The office is clean and the staff is usually pretty professional and attentive.  Not sure if she is returning to the practice so I had to find another primary care physician but would prefer to see Dr. Cruz again.",
        "The food was great. \\n\\nNice , little clean place.\\nThe menu lacks description , but I was able to ask the waiter about anything that sounded interesting. \\n\\nI will be back.",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "A healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza! The dumplings are homemade and are very soft. I had the carrot + beef dumplings and they were quite delicious. The congee is fairly cheap at 2$ a bowl so whenever I have spare change, I stop by and grab one. Give the place a try!",
        "Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!",
        "I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "I have used completely clean for several years for my cars and company trucks and they are fabulous always on time and will work on meeting me were my trucks or cars  are even at last minute to get them cleaned Thank you",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "Had a not-so-great experience at US Egg. My veggie frittata was really soggy, like a veggie frittata soup. The frozen vegetables must have thawed in the dish.",
        "Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\\n\\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together.",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you.",
        "I thought the food here was pretty good - cheap too. It started as an Ethiopian restaurant but the server told me that some Somalis bought it. The atmosphere was fine and they have a sitting room - see photo. The service was fine and the bathrooms were clean. My date enjoyed her Vegan meal and I enjoyed my beef dish. We left thoroughly satisfied - the portions were adequate. I would come here again. Celebrate Diversity! Solid!",
        "I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere.",
        "Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!",

        "2nd time in a row that they have overbooked and now I am waiting for a car. Why bother making reservations when they don't have enough cars! I was supposed to pick up my car at 11:15 am and it is 12:30, and they say it will be ready in another 30 mins. Whoever the operations manager is should seriously consider other career paths, because clearly this is not an area of strengh!",
        "Probably not the cleanest place in town, but not unbearably dirty either. The food, however, is great. The bacon cheeseburger I ordered was excellent. The \\\"regular\\\" order of fries was very generous and among the best fries I've ever had. \\n\\nAnd the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch.",
        "I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.",
        "i came in on thursday with a gift card to spend. paul, the genius who assisted me, was awesome. we chatted and he helped me pick out some great accessories. he also had a look at/cleaned/fixed the input on my ancient iPod, free of charge. \\n\\nfantastic customer service will keep me coming back for all my apple needs.",
        "As a bar it's pretty decent. As for the food well... If you're going to prepare ALL your food in a microwave, can you at least hide it somewhere in the back. I would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos.",
        "Had a bad experience, you couldn't get a place to sit unless you spent $700 plus on bottle service. Had half the club roped of and empty. FYI it was $45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes, it was that much of a downer",
        "Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.  \\nThe drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed."

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

        "Went to Ventanos because a friend recommended it and we loved it! The wine was excellent, the bread had a good flavor, the food was delicious, and the view was amazing! I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too.",
        "This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)",

Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need.",

        "Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here.",
        "Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.",
        "Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\\n\\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \\n\\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Conveniently located. Fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit. They also do takeaway pastry (mediocre looking pastry), sandwiches, and beverages.\\n\\nPeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though! JEEBUS that stuff was scalding. My latte was out to torture tongues.",
        "I love this restaurant! The portions are generous, and the food is flavorful and filling. The service was awesome and they were definitely attentive to our table even though there were others in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe wait time for the food was not long at all, but to keep us entertained, they have books and games at the tables to pass the time. Such a fun idea.\\n\\nI highly recommend the fish and chips or the blue cheese bacon burger!",
        "I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me.",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \\\"OK\\\" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude.",
        "Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\\n\\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back.",
        "This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Wow talk about outstanding food and service. This place knows how to top both. My Family and I ate here Wednesday We had such great service \\\"Carlos M\\\" it being our first time eatting  there he was very helpfull on answering our qwestions and offering sudjustions. He was always right there filling our drinks checking on how everything was.",
        "Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!\\nCornbread is sick !!!\\nAlso try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. \\nMy fav place in CU",
        "When in Vegas,\\n\\n1) buy a delicious \\\"adult slurpee\\\" in a delicious flavor right outside the Imperial Palace\\n2) bring said special, yard-long beverage into the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club\\n3) sing or mock karaoke\\n4) enjoy!\\n5) your pre-game is complete... time to go out!",
        "Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok.",
        "I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",
        "Yum! This place is good! \\n\\nNice and clean, interesting variety with nutrition info included for each flavor! \\n\\nMy daughter is super picky with her toppings and this place is a winner. Price is right, too. Will be back.",
        "The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\\n\\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",
        "Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge.",
        "They were really nice and welcoming here at the Gelato Bar.  The staff lets you try  anything flavor you want.  There is fruit flavored gelatos to coffee and vanilla.  The coffee and vanilla were my favorites.  I would definitely go back here again.  I love this place.",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "The flavors and toppings were okay.\\nI was a little disappointed how few non-fat options there were.\\nThey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes.",
        "The food is bland and tasteless. Maybe I'm spoiled by good filipino food. The tocino is flavorless, how can this happen? The karekare had no flavor as wells as the adobo. Really? How can you botch those up? \\n\\nAt least the food was warm and fresh. But I would eat anything cold with more flavor. The food here isn't made with care. This is a big let down.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.",
        "Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \\n\\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.",
        "I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here.",
        "Try the Aloha or Tart yogurt. Their toppings are yummy as long as you don't get the pineapple because I'm pretty sure it comes from a can. Gross. But the berries are always fresh. The patio is a bit loud but the location is cute.",
        "first off i am not a fan of this place at all. There are various places in charlotte with the same set up doing it way better. The onion rings where not what i expected greasy and lacking in flavor. My burger was sub par but i did enjoy my milkshake. Maybe it was just a bad day but it didn't win me over enough to ever come back.",
        "Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \\\"etiqueccy\\\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer.",
        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",
        "Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here.",
        "Flavors and portions were spot on but customer service is lacking. While the service leaves much to be desired it wouldn't prevent me from frequenting the restaurant.",
        "Everything here is amazing. Their pizza is bomb, its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for. Their turkey lasagna is also my go to. Their flavored margerita's are also really good...... and i dont even like margaritas. that is all.",
        "Not impressive.  Adequate service, but for the price the menu items lacked attention to detail. No guarana.  Feijoada is not very authentic.   Pao de queijo a bit heavy.  Meats were a little bland in flavor. Salad bar had good variety, though.  A little limited selection in the meats compared to other similar Brazilian steakhouses.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",
        "I gave this place 5 stars in the past but I have changed my mind since new owners have taken over.  They have raised their prices and you can only get one flavor for the kid size, which you used to be able to get two.  Thumbs down!",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain",
        "This place kind of just fell into my lap while walking around our office building. This place has REALLY good food if you are into heavy, flavorful meals. My favorite to get here is the Jambalaya. SO GOOD. This location is a very small location, but worth standing in line for if you wanted to try it. It's constantly packed, so make sure you are okay with waiting for a spot.",
        "BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.",
        "Small and ghetto. What more can I say. You will be bum rushed by panhandlers if the shirt your wearing looks clean and you are clean shaven. Area is sketchy so bring your glock!!",
        "I think I've officially had my first taste of real southern BBQ.  This stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right.  I really liked how the brisket was nice and tender.  And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.",
        "Always satisfying and never a let down!\\nEverything we ordered was cooked to perfection.\\nEach steak was juicy and the seared tuna was excellent!\\nThe atmosphere here is comfortable with traditional flare.\\nA really nice place to spend any meal!",
        "Checked in and 2 hours later checked out.  There was no working wifi service in my room, nobody answering the switchboard, no replies from management, nobody available to help me out. Its a shame when management is so poor that a guest leaves feeling this way.",
        "You are given an order sheet. You check off what you want and toppings on your burger etc.   The staff is friendly.  We came here because of groupon deal.  It was a little hard to find since it was not on the main strip.  They give you big portions for fries and my burger was good.",
        "Awesome! I'm here for business and planned on trying someplace new every day...I had Thai House for lunch and I'm tempted to go back for dinner.\\n\\nShrimp & chicken pad Thai, level 3 spiciness add pineapples! Service was quick. Food flavor robust.",
        "Nice open place. The music is VERY loud. We liked the beer, especially the Van Horne IPA. The food though, is very average. Not awful, but lacking flavour and freshness. So, good place for a good beer, but for the food, you have many interesting options nearby...",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.",
        "Okay hands down favorite food place in the entire world!  It is more than heaven in your mouth! So many different flavors! I go to school right by it and go there everyday during my lunch break and is the best ! I recommend everyone to try and and they fall in love !",
        "Review is only for the tacos they serve outside. They're $.99 each but they charge tax with it. I like their selection of meats like cow head and beef tongue and they've got like 5 salsas. But I found their meat to be really tough and lacking flavor. Definitely a taco stand you can skip.",
        "Fresh, hot, made to order burgers and fries, and shakes that are to die for... What else could you ask for in a burger joint?! I love being able to build my dream sammich every time and indulge in differently flavored fries and extravagant shakes. Love it!",
        "I eat vegetarian about 95% of the time, but when I feel like eating some flesh I have the turkey sandwich from Blackstrap. Super delicious and soooo flavorful. The braised greens and fried macaroni and cheese balls are really good, too! I know it's a BBQ place, and their whole concept is meat, BUT I would really, really, really love if they threw in a couple main vegetarian options.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",
        "I had the Angry dog and it was very very tasty. I will definitely be back to this place. They have unique flavors. It's not your normal hot dog stand, that's for sure!",
        "Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again",
        "Gone so far downhill, they should just close this location. Had probably the worst Carne Asada Burrito any place in Vegas has ever served!\\nShould have been suspicious when it was ready in like 90 seconds. They worst re-overheated Leather Beef Jerky that I have ever tried to chew!\\n\\nAVOID THIS PLACE!",
        "I ordered a beef and cheese sandwich, which was forgettable. It was beefy, but flavorless. Considering that I have spent time in the East Coast, this in no way resembles hot sandwiches out there. I also found it to be on the expensive side. Their sides look interesting, but will sample them only if I'm in the area, which is right off the Meadows Mall and the 95.",
        "The people here are super friendly and nice. Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin.  I think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.",
        "Good flavor, good service, long wait and under done pepperonis. Gotta go to Grimaldis in Brooklyn to compare the two. Nothing special.",
        "If I have to shop at any giant eagle in my area, it would be this one. The sq. Hill location has more offerings but the employees all hate their lives and are either flirting with each other, on their phones, conversing with another employee, or just effin rude. The employees at the greenfield location are so much more personable and helpful.",
        "Great service and great food.  We had salmon and peel and eat shrimp and both were wonderful.  The service was quick and friendly with great attention to our needs.  Our first trip here but not our last",
        "decent place. tvs, outside seating, and a roll of paper towels hanging on every table! i'm definitely a fan of pizza and beer, only you have to drink the beer there (draft- pretty good!), so take out doesn't afford that combination.  they have wine too.  their appetizers seem good, but i just had the pizza (with veggie toppings) which was just ok.  nothing too special here... maybe its location.",

        "I truly enjoyed my experience at Tandoor. The staff was super friendly, the flavors were both fresh and savory. You must order the Samosa's and  garlic naan to start. My curry chicken was also very satisfying. \\nI betcha didn't know they have free WiFi! ;) So get cozy and stay awhile! Don't forget, it's BYOB.",
        "While the menu was interesting, it is not something I would have typically gravitated towards. To my surprise the group I was with very much enjoyed it! I highly suggest going there with a few friends and ordering a combination of snack and small plate items (don't forget the duck fat fries!). Also had the quail stuffed with chorizo which was amazing. Simply said - great food with a lot of flavor; I will be back on my next trip to Madison!",
        "I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "Absurd wait time. We waited in a line of ~15 people for 45 minutes. I timed the group in front of us (5 orders). It took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin' ice cream. No business this inefficient should be around. But obviously the ice cream is good.",
        "This place obviously changed their hours and didn't update anything else except the door on their business. Last time I came by, they were closed randomly. Ok, I understand things happen and it's necessary. No problem. However, now they are closed on Sundays and didn't bother to update their answering service or information online. Annoying.",
        "I like this place it's close to home but thats not the only reason I come here they have a great selection of draft beer. I am a wine drinker but do enjoy a flavorful beer and they have them in spades. Not only that but they several local beers and boutique draft beers. The food is not to bad either, in fact it's pretty tasty and compliments their draft portfolio nicely.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",

Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",

The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking \\\"Colorado cigarettes\\\" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.",
        "I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",

        "A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside.",

        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.",
        "I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.",
        "They get one star for cleanliness and decor. Aside from that, the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu.",
        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "The meatballs are amazing. The entrees are great. Interesting, delicious cocktails. Nice atmosphere. The service was good and the staff friendly. It's a great place for a date night or just a satisfying, delicious dinner.",
        "I go there all the time. I went almost every viet restaurant around the neighborhood and this place the best. Cheap and high quality food. Try pho combo and u wont regret it. Open 24/7/365 and always clean and serve good food. They give good amount of bean sprouts too. Highly recommended.",
        "I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part.",
        "I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back.",
        "Horrible service. No one had any idea what was going on. Overpriced. Everything took FOREVER to come out. Will definitely not return.",
        "Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!  They were short handed due to unexpected departure of an employee and went out of their way to make sure the customers left happy.  Food was fresh and delicious, love that grilled pita.  Will be going back again soon!",
        "Meh. It was fine, but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken. But they ignored the mistake as if it's how the dish comes out. Maybe I'm ignorant to Afghan style beef. Or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue. Either way they handled it terribly. And the service was lacking. Bleh.",
        "Great place for an after work drink and appetizers. Went Wednesday night for 1/2 bottle night. Try the meatballs and fried mozzarella, it's the best in town.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "I will never be back here, very rude staff at checkin, valet, and service. This is an old crappy motel that has a new coat of paint and a new name.  Awful!",
        "I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...",
        "This is a nice Mom & Pop caf\\u00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers.  Owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one. Prices are  reasonable. Cheerful and happy staff! Always meets  you with a smile. Omelets are HUGE!",
        "Just 2wks in training with Angela and I'm already noticing weight change and definition! Haven't set foot in a gym over 7yrs and I'm in love with the training! Angela helps push me and keeps me motivated and focused! This is definitely a lifestyle I want to keep!!! Thank you Angela!!!",
        "Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am  going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap.\\nDo not consider buying this....\\n\\n\\n'b",
        "It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing.",
        "We came into Las Vegas from Phoenix and found this gem of a store. They were very well stocked with games for anyone's taste and the staff was extremely knowledgeable about their stock and the game industry.",
        "Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!",
        "As usual these people go above and beyond today we showed up 20 minutes before they opened and took a chair outside to wait for opening the very delightful wait person came out side to greet us, I said I know your not open yet we'll just wait out here until your ready, he said no problem were ready do you want to dine here or inside ? We chose inside and we were seated at our fave corner table. This place rocks Great job guys",
        "Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.",
        "This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.",
        "I am a loyal customer and love the place! The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places.",
        "Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!",
        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.",
        "I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.",
        "One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!",
        "This is a good Gap outlet at times.  Normally, we come out of this store empty-handed because the prices were too high.  The last couple of times, though, we have found some good bargains in there clearance section.\\n\\nThe store is clean and organized.  The employees are okay.",
        "Came here for dinner. I had their special Basil w chicken and vegetables. It was good but not amazing. We also got the shrimp spring rolls. These were very good. I got my husband the drunken noodles and he did not like it at all. I don't want to judge off of one experience so I'll go back and try different items on the menu. I'm hoping other items will b better because I love Thai food.",
        "Tried the lamb kubideh. It was very reasonable pricing, for $7.99 I got a healthy serving of kubideh with rice, and bread. They make the bread at the location! Everything tasted wonderful. And we ended our meal with a Baklava. Do try it!",
        "Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.",
        "They get zero stars we have had our suite now booked for 5+ months we go to check in and they tell us SORRY you have been down graded!!! WTF what Hotel does this???!!! NEVER book here you don't know what you till you check in!!",
        "Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong.",
        "I didn't stay at the hotel, only went to the buffet.\\n\\nAll I can say is, It's bad when the best part of the buffet is the beverage.",
        "Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice.. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",
        "This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to. The koobideh was fantastic.",
        "Nice Hotel but Bad Casino...\\n\\n-the gambling floor is really small.\\n-they did not have food service at the pool but said they will soon, this was in March.\\n-tried to upsell me a better view of the fountain for 35 more a night, I didnt bite. i got the back side of the airport...Pist.\\n-for 20 bux more i could of stayed at Caesars Palace that weekend",
        "I used to eat here regularly, but a poor customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. So congratulations Napoli, a long time, regular customer is gone.",
        "When I was kid, we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis. They have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly. \\n\\nThe hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable, its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience.",
        "Genuine stuff with so many unique options. Love they offer calzone.  Spicy olive oil a hit. Good for business or pleasure.",
        "I love this place! It's a great hang out on the strip. They have excellent service and great drinks :)",
        "I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.",
        "BRUNCH: Went there for brunch once and it was eeally OK. We couldn't even get a clean glass of water. Imagine! And the food was good but nothing \\\"woah\\\" about it. In my opinion, this place is a bit overrated and overpriced for the menu they have to offer.\\n\\nI will give it a try for dinner. Let's hope this time it will be less disappointing.",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",
        "Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "I have been coming to this salon for about 2 years and i have always been extremely happy with their work. My hairstylist, Valerie, is super. She is great to talk to while I'm getting my haircut and is really great at doing my hair. During the shampoo she does scalp massages with mint shampoo that relax even the most stressed person. If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut.",
        "oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um, well, it was silken tofu.  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal.  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing.",
        "The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \\n\\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.",
        "Usually I'm a Starbucks girl but the Iced Chocolate Coffee I had was delicious! I look forward to trying more things!",
        "Always has great lunch specials.. Back rubs with every meal which was really weird but what the hell never had that at lunch.",
        "Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.",
        "Stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here. I didn't like the place . Rooms where outdated . Casino was always busy and couldn't enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos",
        "Normally the boy does not enjoy museums, but he had a lot of fun in this one.\\n\\nLots of historic sex toys and insane sex toys. Video clips, films, demonstrations. Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\\n\\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive.",
        "Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!",
        "They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...",
        "Awful sushi! Not friendly at all. The waitress had such a bad attitude. Never again. Not even for free!!!!!!",
        "Good selection of machines, comfortable environment and down to earth, friendly people.",
        "Not great but good.",
        "This nail salon, which used to be a nice neighborhood shop, has fallen.  On a day I was pressed for time, I made an appointment.  After waiting \\\"just a minute\\\" for 20 minutes, then using the dirty restroom, and being told \\\"2 more minutes,\\\" I decided to take my business elsewhere.  I will not be returning.",
        "Worst service ever!! dispatchers are rude and cabs have a tendency to \\\"no show\\\"",
        "Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!",
        "The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",
        "I LOVE MARATHONS!! Everything is fantastic. It always tastes the same which equals HEAVENLY... that's all I can say.",
        "I love Metta Yoga.  The instructors are so warm and helpful, and the other students too are not afraid to laugh and also help me \\\"get\\\" a pose.  Awesome vibes to this place.  I bought a package deal so I could come again after my first free class.",
        "Had breakfast here meeting my sister that I hadn't seen in years... Was a little worried at first with it being so busy ... Let's just say the wait was well worth it... The service by Donna the best ever and the whole entire staff was quick and listened to our needs thank you so much for making our breakfast experience amazing",
        "Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.",
        "Hmm, had a not so good experience.\\nProbably not going back. \\n\\nWell, I guess even the coolest places have to have growing pains.\\nOh, and the music sucks now. The now have two boys that sound exactly alike.\\n\\nEven more offensive, one of the guitarists was smoking near my table as he was \\\"setting up\\\".",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "The dresses are wonderful and they range from xs to 3x. \\n\\nHowever, it is a painful experience every-time I shop there. The sales clerks are just too cool to help me.",
        "I'd give this place 5 stars based on the taste of food, because it's great. My favorite place out here so far. However this place loses a star because when you order for pick up, you get very little food. Disappointing for the price you pay. You almost want to eat in the restaurant every time because only then do do you get the amount of food you pay for.",
        "Great company to work with. Very professional and knowing the right technique about local search marketing and search engine optimization. \\n\\nThey really knows how to engage with audience and bring connection between customers and business. Highly recommend!",

        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",

It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",

        "This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.",

        "The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",

        "Typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals. Definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there. The coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well.",
        "Food does not taste good.  The food is boring and bland.  I regretted eating there the moment I tasted the food.  I will stick with the other Mexican food place down the street which is cheaper and the food tastes better!",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "Sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!",
        "Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.",
        "Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "Have to give this place five stars.  Menu is great, value is great but the cook Jose is the best.  Great customer service, really knows how to treat a customer.  He gave me a sample of the Greek fries yesterday and they are out-of-this-world good!",
        "This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.",
        "Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The \\\"Jimmy the Attorney\\\" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the \\\"food safe\\\" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \\n\\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!",
        "Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\\n\\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.",
        "My boyfriend and I dined in and thoroughly enjoyed it. Food was good and our hostess/waitress was great!!! Good food, great service, great price.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",
        "Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\\n\\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality.",
        "I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",
        "Waffles were so good, but other breakfast items could make this place a hit. Also, not a large seating area.",
        "I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.  \\n\\nLove the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.\\n\\nI could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do.",
        "Great food , the salmon was to die for.\\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter",
        "One of my favorite lounges in Vegas for the generally upscale crowd, ample seating, and elevated vantage point from the 1.5 and 3rd floors.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.",
        "This is a small pharmacy with an incredibly knowledgeable staff that will go above and beyond. They check dating on OTC bottles and will save you money with their prices.",
        "They now have vegetarian fajitas, $10, not a bad price but you don't get much tofu at all and the ones at Jack Astor's are better in every way.\\n\\nOver all they're not bad, but I don't think I'd order them again.",
        "Need a break from the super pricey Vegas Strip that eats a hole into your wallet? Pop's is a breath of fresh air with its decent pizza at a reasonable price. It is a nice place to decompress and blend in with the wall coverings.\\n\\nPizza was hot, slices were big and ingredients seemed fairly fresh.",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.",
        "went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. \\n\\nMy table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area.",
        "The view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing. I only give it 3 stars because I didn't think the food measured up to the price. however, I think what you're paying for is the experience. I'm glad I went once, but I probably wouldn't go back.",
        "Pretty expensive and not terribly original.  I didn't really see a clear theme, other than obviously Beatles music.  As usual talented performers.  But in my opinion not worth the ticket price.  If you really want to go then try half price ticket provider.  I would vote for the Absinthe show if you are up for raunchy.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "Had the King crab legs--hard to give it anything but 5 stars, but it was pricey.  It's a great restaurant, but in a town of great restaurants, it's 4 stars.",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",
        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "Great atmosphere in this place. Had a huge booth overlooking the bar. Had the prime rib, and was happy with it. Good place, a little pricey, but you already knew that.",
        "I didn't have any coupons so paid 7.49 plus tax for this place.  I was pretty happy until I went to Main Street Cafe and paid 7.99 for three times the variety of food.  However, if you gots the coupon, then Paradise might be your bet.  I could really only find chicken worth eating...oh and a few items from the dessert area.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "I went here for breakfast daily when I was on vacation because of the reasonable prices so that I was able to do some damage at the steakhouses at night!\\n\\nDon't forget to get your patronage card stamped because after a certain amount I think you get a free one.\\n\\nThe service was good and the food was Ok but its really hard to mess up breakfast.",
        "Its good food.  Its just not the greatest food for the price you pay.  I had a spicy chicken of some sort, and they dont mess around when it comes to the spicy stuff.  This stuff was HOT.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I just didnt feel like the food justified the price.  $11 for a lunch special?  No thanks.  I would give the food 4 out of 5 stars though.",
        "A decent sandwich for a decent price. Not the best Italian sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.  Everything is \\u00c0 la carte though so it can get expensive.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to get here JUST for a sandwich, but if you are nearby it probably won't disappoint",
        "Love the whole subway concept for pizza. I don't know whats better the pizza or the price!",
        "The oysters here were really good. The price here is very fair for seafood. Although the reason that I'm giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt. We ordered the seafood gumbo and I had to take a gulp of water everytime I took a bite of my gumbo.",
        "Absolutely horrendous service, pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza. The waitress was 100 and we waited an hour and a half for them to forget our order. Ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food!",
        "By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!",
        "Yum! This place is good! \\n\\nNice and clean, interesting variety with nutrition info included for each flavor! \\n\\nMy daughter is super picky with her toppings and this place is a winner. Price is right, too. Will be back.",
        "The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\\n\\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",
        "I just tried Crust for the first time today and I am in love!  True to the name, the crust is crispy and tastes like a breadstick (they use parm cheese and garlic butter).  Prices are reasonable I'll be back for more!",
        "I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness",
        "I struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars, really should be 1.5.  I agree with others regarding the rude/surly male employee.  I have the impression he is the owner or manager so I am not sure this will ever be addressed.  The salads are good, but value is poor.  Don't waste your time or money.",
        "This is really cool. It's a nice lil' hike and adventure to take when visiting the viewpoints and natural history of the Phoenix area. \\n\\nBest to visit at sunset!",
        "Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area.",
        "Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!"

        "I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...",
        "Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.",
        "Great food. Outside heaters not working!!! Cold!!!",
        "You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else.",

        "Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. \\n\\nI am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.",
        "Perfect day for target practice with the pistol. Sure beats an indoor range when the weather is cooperating. Today it was perfect barely even a breeze. Friendly staffers very cheap and you can buy ammo there if you don't have your own. Its a bit  of a drive unless you live in Aliante but definitely worth it!",

But you had no problem charging for it. I wanted to like this place!",

We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",

        "This place is just ok for me. The restaurant has a nice setting, good service, and nice entertainment. The food is good but not great for the price. The steaks were slightly over aged for my taste, au gratin potatoes were very tasty though. They have a nice wine list with many options for all budgets. Its worth a try if you are at gvr and looking for a nice meal but I prefer most of the steak houses on the strip over this place.",
        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",

        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",

Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",

Or when you are sweating balls in that nice, desert heat when August rolls around.",

        "I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!",
        "Definitely one of the finest properties in Las Vegas. The location is outstanding with great access to The Strip, McCarran, the highways and tons of other Vegas locales. The building and facilities are immaculate. The Valets, Concierge & security team are the ultimate professionals. We bought a unit as a vacation home in 2011 and its tranquil, safe and a fun place to getaway to.",
        "I was in a jam and needed a locksmith quick, I searched Yelp and came across Master Lock & Security-I called them and the spoke to the owner, Carmon , explained my situation and before you knew it - he was at my location in less than 30 minutes-very good service, he gave me a fair price and i would not hesitate to use his company or recommend him to others!",
        "The price was good for the strip and the location was centrally located. The free valet was a nice relief. The staff was friendly and the room was clean.\\n\\nDefinitely pay the extra money to upgrade and get a view of the strip and volcano from your room if you have the option!",
        "Came here in July. It was hot. Not just hot but hot as hell. That was inside. On the balcony. There was a cool view of downtown Fremont. But it is even hotter. I was in there looking for air conditioning vents. The bar was OK. Nothing real special besides the view of the Fremont. I would return in a cooler month if i am downtown again. The music was good. That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.",
        "Not being open during posted hours when you have multiple customers outside in the heat waiting for your uhaul service is totally unacceptable.",
        "The nacho selection did not impress me I like real cheese on my nachos bummer. \\n\\nI ordered the chips and salsa, chips were bathed in salt and only one salsa was tasty. I went for the burger as my entree which was actually pretty good.",
        "I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!",
        "this place is great'' I would highly recomend this buffet to everyone who go to vegas. first thing was the pizza it was good and big.second was the pasta tortaini with the alfrado sasue.third was the sushi it was small but it was good and last but not least the dessert was awsome the puding was nice and creamy and the fruit was fruity and the chessecake was magnificent  everything in the buffet was good.",
        "This is my crafting paradise. Whether you are decorating, sewing, painting or whatever, this is the best place. It's so clean and neat. I never have a hard time finding what I want. The staff is friendly and they always have great sales here. You can even go online and download coupons.  I prefer this place over Michael's. Their prices and selection are way better.",
        "Great beer selection, great atmosphere, great bartenders. What more can I say? Perfect for someone wanting to enjoy a beer with good friends. Monday night is the night for great specials but I prefer to go the other nights of the week when The Saucer is a bit quieter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is has nothing good to say about Charlotte night life, this will certainly change your mind. Give the fresh pretzels with queso a try!",
        "fun music and vacation atmosphere in the heat of tempe summer...\\n\\nbut we won't be back. \\n\\nmargaritas were so salty, beers were watery, and food was too spicy - the kind of spicy that drowns out the flavor (and this is coming from a Thai-Hot kinda girl).  \\n\\nFood/drinks are reasonable, but it was a total waste of money.",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\\n\\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\\n\\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "What kind of mystery meat do they put in these wrinkly giant hot dogs? Actually, I don't want to know, but it filled me up for $2.\\n\\nAnd you (blackjack) people who constantly double down when the dealer is showing 10 and you have 10...I'm going to choke you.",
        "Cold and stale fries. Got the \\\"modern dog\\\" which is essentially a Chicago style hot dog. It wasn't clear whether they had bothered to heat it up or cook the hot dog as it was room temperature. Terrible terrible food.",
        "Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs, air filters, and other automotive bits.  They also offer a huge selection of housewares and hardware.  Also, this place is CHEAP.  \\n\\nOne other thing: if you're a student going to a barn dance, Farm and Fleet is your one stop shop for flannel shirts, farm boots, and enormous belt buckles.",
        "Won't be eating here again. The tzatziki sauce was waterey and bland. Should be flavorful and creamy. The service was ok but the food was subpar.",
        "My husband and I love coming here for HH to download from the day. Postino's has great food, wine and atmosphere. We always sit at the bar and are very well taken care of by Patrick and Dan.  We stick to the bruschetta board but have tried the roast beef, turkey and chicken sandwiches and they are pretty tasty as well.  The salads are good also but I prefer a sandwich or board.",
        "Loved.This.Place. Awesome candlelit ambience, spacious seating options, and friendly service.  Well-sorted menu with vegetarian and seafood options (yay me). Deschutes Brewery Porter. Affordable price point.",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",
        "I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!",
        "I have gone to this shop for a while now and have been pretty satisfied with the crew and service. You can't go wrong with the 90 day return/exchange policy and they have a pretty good selection. Also have an indoor putting green and some bays to test out clubs. Good location, nice and close to many good courses. I prefer Vans over Golfsmith anyday.",
        "I always prefer to support the local businesses but Subway is better.",
        "This review is for the Sunday Market on Eastern.\\nVery limited selection at very high prices. Mostly the left overs from the first 2 days.\\nThought I would try it again but it was just the same.\\nYou can save 50% by shopping at the District at Green Valley's farmers market\\non Thursday evening.",
        "Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan.",
        "The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers.",
        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "Just moved here from Michigan a great find from my home state. Great people, great food, and great weather what else can you ask for???",
        "Every time I go here I regret it. The food is not very good obviously, but it is super cheap. Typically I'd prefer taco bell, but the taco bell on Waddell and Litchfield always sucks, so if I'm in the mood for bad,cheap fast food tacos I go here.",
        "This is a small restaurant that appears to be run by the owners.  My husband and I go there often and have always been treated well.  The japanese lasagna roll they make is the best I've found here and in Southern California.  My husband likes their tempura udon soup and claims the maguro tuna is fresh.  This has become our 'go to' sushi place.",
        "Most delicious toffee ever tasted. The variety of flavors to choose from  Is made to perfection which  certainly satisfies the sweet tooth. I first discovered the toffee at the Bruce Trent Farmers Market.  I also like the fact I  buy online to share with family and friends for those special occasions.  :)",
        "Dr. Camp is unprofessional, money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions.",
        "Incredible food and service!  I had their pumpkin curry,  very good... unlike many Thai restaurants this one has a heat scale from 1 to 5 and I ordered a 5.  Now I like my curry spicy but a 5 might have been too much.    Try the green tea ice cream,  its delicious.   I will return to this gem.",
        "All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating.",
        "Food is always great but the service was horrible.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. There was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored. Next time I want Chompie's I will be going to location in Tempe!",
        "This place is great!  I have a flock of chickens and they need food.  Tempe Feed and Tack is close to my house (of course! I live in tempe...) and the people are super helpful and friendly.  They always load up the 50lb bags of feed and I never have to wait.",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",
        "When is SBX going to have a line for those of us wanting COFFEE and not the calorie -ladden fraps that everyone likes to CALL coffee? Express Service NOW!",
        "Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.",
        "War schon \\u00f6ffters dort, und finde denn Restaurant Nicht so der Knaller, f\\u00fcr das gebotene zu teuer. Fleisch\\noft sehr trocken. Bedienung geht so.Ambiente drausen nicht schlecht. Vielleicht  kann man dort notfalls essen gehen.",
        "Great drink prices and nice staff in the bar, but sooooo smoky that I could only stay for one drink.",
        "Good theatre, got tickets and good seats... Air conditioning worked well, bathrooms were very clean... And so were the floors in the theatre.",
        "Had a very difficult time getting into the hotel between the Valet being full, registration very crowded with only a couple staff working the desk, slow service in the restaurant and lots of early morning noise from the housekeeping group in the hallways.",
        "Every time we visit Vegas we HAVE to make a stop here, Yeah we have Amoeba (we live in LA) but I prefer a smaller setting where I wont feel like I'm having an anxiety attack because there is so much to choose from! I like the little novelty Items they carry and you can find some great gems if you look hard, I like how cheap the dvds are.",
        "Authentic Chinese spicy food. when I say spicy, I mean it. The heat here is not for the faint of heart. Everything is very good. I would recommend bringing a Chinese friend to help navigate the menu.",
        "After Planet Dailies and Trader Vic's, I was soooooo happy to land at P F Chang's.  Good food, pretty good service, resonable prices.  Only a few minor negatives, but I much preferred P F Chang's."

        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am  going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap.\\nDo not consider buying this....\\n\\n\\n'b",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "I had ordered gift baskets for my family in Phoenix several times from this store. My last order ensured that I will never do it again. The wine and cheese basket I sent for my sister's birthday never arrived. When I finally got a hold of someone who could explain, he told me that someone spaced it. I also received a couple half-assed apologies. Awful customer service.",
        "Money management doesn't come naturally to most people, so I trust my finances with Silverhawk Financial!",
        "I am sorry to say but it's the worst indian food I have ever had. The food is not fresh and tasted as if it was from previous day's buffet. I am from india and can tell easily by eating indian food if it's fresh or not. Waste of money at this place.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Meh. Pretty boring in my opinion. I cant think of any particular segments were I thought it was funny/cool. \\n\\nThe last 10minutes was entertaining though. Or maybe I was just excited for the show to finally be over. I dont know. \\n\\nDont recommend.. at all.",
        "I've been thinking to stop by forever so I finally did.\\n\\nI'll keep this review short and simple. It's OK. If you're around, give it a shot (there's not much in that side of the 101) but don't drive more than 2 miles for that. Just saying.",
        "So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.\\n\\nWell they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked.",
        "Great BBQ. The chicken is the best BBQ chicken I've ever had!\\nCornbread is sick !!!\\nAlso try the pineapple tequila. So great to sip with a meal. \\nMy fav place in CU",
        "Stayed here in 2009\\nBesides a roach being in our room and the staff providing us with spray so that we could handle the problem ourselves; it was a nice stay. The staff overall was kind and helpful and the resort was very close to the strip.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",
        "Just don't bother.  Sub par food, slow service, and over priced.  Go to Einstein's of you want a decent bagel that isn't dry and bland.   Even after the request to toast my bagel it was still cold.  You also have to spend your own cream cheese.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\\n\\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\\n\\nRun away -",
        "The staff is amazing. Tyler took the time to analyze my gait, brought out several different shoes, and set me up with the perfect pair to keep my ankles in proper alignment. This has made such a difference! The shin splints that have plagued me my whole life, no longer prevent me from running.",
        "Great food and fun classy atmosphere. I love the menu because there is something for everyone. Everything I've tried has been good but my favorite is rice pudding with Turkish coffee. And the hookah lounge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner.",
        "Honk!  What a difference of opinion from the reviews read before patronizing this salon.   No one wants to go into a salon and come out looking ten years older sporting a style that is tired and not becoming.  Not a fan of the product or the attitude; won't be returning.",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "we've heard a lot about this place, and finally went there, and it kind of sucked. hardly any sauces, and it's totally ugly inside. also, i'm not sure if the girl working at the front is even old enough to avoid child labor laws.\\n\\ntheir pineapple was bad.\\n\\nlai lai is way better, and so is genghis grill. avoid this place.",
        "Every Indian in Las Vegas eats here. If you're not Indian and you want to eat where the Indians eat, this is it. It's the Bomb. and I don't mean Bay.\\n\\nEveryplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie Slumdog compared to this.",
        "This place has great panang chicken ..highly recommend this place",
        "Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\\n\\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives.",
        "Try the Aloha or Tart yogurt. Their toppings are yummy as long as you don't get the pineapple because I'm pretty sure it comes from a can. Gross. But the berries are always fresh. The patio is a bit loud but the location is cute.",
        "Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.\\n\\nI goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation. \\n\\nI recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",

        "VERY OVER RATED!   SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend.  Charges for in room frig and internet.  Many other extra fees.  OVERPRICED  Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings.  VALET Service does get 5 stars.  Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",
        "I would not return here again, it was very unclean, and the servers ignored us all night. The food was horrible, way try dry on the chana. I still love the indian place next them.",
        "Good, fast food.\\n\\nI stop here every so often when I'm walking on Craig for an inexpensive, but filling meal. Go for the sub combos, easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it!",
        "OMG this place is so amazing, the food is so delicious, and the price for the portion and the quality is totally worth it. The staff are very friendly. I m so happy we finally have a great tonkatsu place like this in Vegas",
        "Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "I came here for lunch on Sunday and for some reason they did not have any crab legs.  How can you not serve crab legs??\\n\\nEvery time I go to a buffet, I must eat the prime rib.  And their prime rib was OK.  A few things that stood out were the lobster ravioli, shrimp and peso pizza, and the french toast station.  They have a big dessert section.  But no cones for ice cream!",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Awesome indian food and service.",
        "My husband and I had finally decided to have a date since my son was born(which is now 20 months old). We thought we deserve it and we want to have a romantic breakfast. I had the french toast and he got the croque madame. Both were delicious. I'm not a coffee person but we ordered coffee for our drinks. Coffee was delicious!",
        "Found this place through yelp. Service and food was amazing. I got an omelet as a scramble and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also toasted for me on the grill which I loved! ONE WARNING! The portions are GIGANTIC! I barely finished half my omelet. My boyfriend got the mamas and it looked like something out of man vs. food! If you hung over and hungry this is the place to go!",
        "Awesome! I'm here for business and planned on trying someplace new every day...I had Thai House for lunch and I'm tempted to go back for dinner.\\n\\nShrimp & chicken pad Thai, level 3 spiciness add pineapples! Service was quick. Food flavor robust.",
        "Ordered a hot sandwich......and 28 minutes later and after asking 3x's I finally got it.  Way to long to have to wait for lunch.",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "I love the bread pudding and the soup.  But the prices are high, not open on Sunday, and I was not impressed with the breakfast.",
        "Cold food at 11:45 buffet. Will never go back.\\n\\nWatery as hell Tikka Masala and butter chicken.if you're used to the chandler location this one is nothing like it. Different recipes altogether.\\n\\nSkip this is you like Real Indian food.\\n\\nMight change my review if they actually invited me back for some HOT food. Im upset I did not leave.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",
        "Great service! No wait, actually owned by Pamela's! The food was great-- maybe even better than next door! All sorts of Yiddish references and fun Jewish foods that are hard to find elsewhere. Love the challah French toast. Highly recommended!!",
        "Bring your own wine and hang out in a trendy location in the plateau! The veal scallopini is good. as well as the lobster bisque! The lines are long but if you go on a nice summer evening it's not such a bother as it's a busy fun street with lots to look at!  Good for the younger crowd who don't mind hanging around waiting.",
        "Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!",
        "The ahi tuna tacos that everyone talks about. ..they are completely raw and cold.  I wish they had a seared option. However,  I was thrilled with the veggie enchiladas.  Vivian,  our fantastic bartender,  allowed me to get them 2 ways!",
        "Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \\\"Sammy\\\" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \\\"I'll be with you in a moment\\\" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying.",
        "Great night was had with 20+ guests. Have had Indian food in parts of AZ, as well as New York and Australia, this was one of the better places that's for sure. Staff were friendly and attentive and the meals were served quickly. Well worth a return visit.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "Simpsons Arcade game!\\nProp Cycle!\\nMusic games!\\nWHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM THEM!!!\\nShut up and give them your money!",
        "Very disappointing. Went there for a late breakfast (11 am), paid 100$ for 3 people. Rushed, unfriendly service. Tasteless toasts straight from the supermarket. Butter had a weird, cheesy taste. Omelet was just ok. The Verandah gets one star for its nice outside terrace and one star for the mini Belgian waffles, the only dish we had that was above average.",
        "Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. \\n\\nI'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.",
        "Iron-man for sure. Thanks Tony for an amazing job and dealing with a difficult customer. My husband finally found his Barber! Truly an amazing cut and experience. Great location and shop.  You rock in the Mohawk dept.",
        "We came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it. I've ordered masala's at other places and they haven't made them as spicy as I like them to be, but here I ordered spicy chicken masala and I received a flavorful hot, SPICY chicken masala. Staff was very friendly and attentive.\\nP.S.\\nI Love Indian Food! ;-)",
        "Always passed this place, and finally today stopped in for a burrito. I got the AL Pastor pork burrito. It was a little heavy on the refried beans, but overall was a very nice burrito. I'll come back again and try other things.",
        "First off, I was annoyed for waiting over half an hour for waffles, it wasn't over crowded so that was just lame. This place is over hyped, nothing special. Just a bunch of different toppings on waffles. Big whoop! The food isn't bad it's just not anything special.",
        "This place is extremely good.  It is the second best Indian resturant in Vegas.  The first being Namaste.   It is not a hole in the wall just in an off strip location.  This is where the locals eat!",
        "Great place, finally a healthy juice in Vegas!!!! Definitely will visit again on my next trip to Vegas :)",
        "Loved it! Best French toast ever!",
        "The food was very good, old school the garlic toast and homemade thousand island dressing were very nostalgic.  The 2x baked potato was huge and the steak was excellent, but the bathrooms!  Please do something about them, it hurt the experience of an otherwise nice Friday night!",
        "Great food!\\n\\nWe had the pineapple rice, papaya salad, red curry chicken and stuffed chicken wings... all great.\\n\\n2nd best Thai that I have had in L.V.... Lotus of Siam is still the best!",
        "Excellent lunch buffet.  Amazing food.  Great service.  Clean.  Reasonably priced. Kids had never tried Indian food until today and LOVED it.  Will definitely be back!",
        "Finally found a great Vegas hotel that suits our family need - It's very spacious, comfortable, nice Jacuzzi, great indoor/outdoor pool, non-smoking, and Quiet at night. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of some casinos, but it provided true comfort and luxury. If I have to complain about something, their food selection is very limited. We go out to stripe for food.",
        "Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Space isn't as visually appealing as the other \\\"snow ice\\\" competitor. Lack of printed menus. Order is handwritten on the container.\\n\\nLIKE  The strawberry condensed milk. Usage of natural ingredients. Lighter/fluffier than its competitor. Egg pudding as a topping.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "Real good, mesquite grilled steaks, burgers, chicken ect. in a rustic, yet clean setting.  Fair prices, decent selection, the service was excellent. \\n\\nIts only about 7 minutes off of the US 60 (take the Idaho exit, not Tomahawk) .  If you want a different atmosphere, give it a try, you wont be disappointed. \\n\\nOnly down side is that It is a snowbird mecca",
        "Just had the best spinach pie in my life, so fresh and garlicky! Jb and the inlaws all had chicken tandoori and each were raving about it. I tasted the basmati rice which was light & fluffy and sooo full of flavor.  Salims catered a friends wedding last year andthere were absolutely no complaints. Salims is amazing!  Can't wait to go back!!",
        "went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.",
        "I had lunch there yesterday.\\nThey have a very nice ambience and perfect service. The staff is great.\\nI wouldn't recommend the pineapple fried rice or the nasi goran because it had a funky taste. My pineapple fried rice came with a duck and Chinese sausage... Didn't taste fresh to me.\\nVery overpriced... Disappointing.",
        "Good for nails BUT DONT GET LASHES DONE HERE! I just looked at a girl at doe eyed lashes in person and omg what a difference! Mine look clumped and glued together and like a strip was put on! They are painful and itchy and my eyes are constantly gooping because of them! No good at all! Hers look natural and amazing!!! Go to doe eyed lashes! They do a fantastic job!",
        "I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.",
        "Very good pho. I've had better, but I was very pleased with theirs. I ordered spicy but I had to add sriracha. Perfectly hit the spot after traipsing in the snow.",
        "I have only had their saag / palak paneer one time but it has never tasted better!!! I try this dish at every Indian joint and this is by far the BEST Indian meal I have ever had. \\nI wish I lived closer so I could eat it on a regular basis.",
        "Finally a coffee shop by work!  The muffins are simply delicious.  I had pumpkins, lemon poppy seed and blueberry to date.  \\n\\nEarlier today I tried the ice tea.  It was flavored and infused with a berry shot - simply delicious.  \\n\\nA good place to sit back read a paper and kick back.",
        "The food is good.  The service was excellent.  Usually however, in Indian restaurants, they give the rice WITH the food.  At this particular restaurant you have order the rice separately and its pretty expensive.  I thought this restaurant was a little more pricier than most.  I don't think I would rush back here for dinner when I am in AZ again but may try the buffet for more of the options.",
        "I haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet, but from whatever I've had here, I would say its a decent option for Indian food. Being a vegetarian, its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food.",
        "Pretty good place. Tasted fresh. I wish the shrimp ceviche was a bit more limey, and spicier. They are also kinda stingy on the toastadas lol, I had to end up using crackers to eat my shrimp . Fish tacos were really good as well. Overall, I will come back again.",
        "Excellent.  It has indian food (good for vegetarians). They make a salad in front of u whixh is good cuz they can properly toss it",
        "Loved the atmosphere, excellent music, very cool patrons and staff.  The seaweed salad was excellent!",
        "Favorite Indian food in AZ. The staff is friendly, my father is a regular and they know him by name. Buffet is so good, and it tastes so flavorful. The naan is also very good and my favorite.",
        "Finally got here for dinner, heard about this restaurant from my friends many times! The food quality is good, environment is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese restaurants, I definitely will come back again!! Had a great dinner here!! Love it..!!!",
        "I wouldn't recommend going here. Apart from very poor service, the food wasn't really great. The only thing good on my plate were the fries. The lady who served us forgot a couple of our drink orders and when she finally did bring them to us, one of them had something floating in it.",
        "The best meal we had in Montreal. A cool vibe, attentive, professional service, but the food... Was divine. The Chasse et Peche namesake (their surf & turf) was a veal with lobster tail. The char with ravioli was incredible. Don't skip the scallop as appetizer and ANYTHING on their dessert menu!",
        "I ordered 3 eggs and bacon * includes three pieces of bacon that didn't look very appetizing and cold toast I expected better from Bellagio I have has better bacon at Mom and Pop places..\\n.",
        "Soooo happy we came here!!! I'm not usually a fan of eating Indian food at a restaurant but we came here for father's day and we not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too. If you like Indian food, you must try this place.",
        "Great ambiance and good service.\\nWe tried the Ceviche, halibut tacos and the chocolate bread pudding. Everything was excellent!",
        "It's a new small place, clean, order at the counter fresh fish fry. They had several types of dips and the french frys were good. No beer :( sad hope that's too come soon. There was plenty served in one serving didn't need more. Husband wished his was crisper and wanted Texas toast.  Fish was white and very good. Coleslaw ok.  Hope they stay and grow - we'll be back.",
        "If you like this sort of thing go for it but anyone with kids who know the difference between kosher hotdogs and crap should avoid the children's menu hot dog! SO disappointed at the lack of quality! Two bites and it went right into the trash. But the onion soup was edible.",
        "They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery.",
        "Service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all. Very much overrated. We had to ask for silverware and water twice. It wasn't very crowded either. Nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank. Only above average item was the French toast.",
        "Never again. We had two free vouchers so we went for lunch and I'm so glad that I didn't have to pay for this meal. They had seafood, Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and different meats as well as a variety of desserts.  We tried a little of almost everything and our tastebuds were bored at best.  \\n\\nI would not come back to this buffet unless it was free again."

        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.",
        "I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...",
        "This is a nice Mom & Pop caf\\u00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers.  Owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one. Prices are  reasonable. Cheerful and happy staff! Always meets  you with a smile. Omelets are HUGE!",
        "Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!",
        "Always has great lunch specials.. Back rubs with every meal which was really weird but what the hell never had that at lunch.",
        "Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!",
        "My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!",
        "I tried a slice of lemon cake; it tasted very artificial...kind of pinesol-ish. Definitely not homemade. I also tried a few cookies that were OK, nothing to get too excited about.",
        "Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest.",
        "Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",
        "This place isn't worth your time. There are FAR better bowling venues in town.\\n\\nSo what's wrong with Arsenal Bowling? Rude staff. Slow bar with limited selection. It's cramped and dirty. Lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7. Misleading specials (other have posted about this).\\n\\nI try to be an easy-going guy, but after trying this place a few times I'm done giving it another chance.",
        "I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!",
        "Typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals. Definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there. The coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well.",
        "Update:  The Chompies in Scottsdale sent us a gift card to apologize for our experience.  That was not necessary although we did accept and we used it last night.  We did go to the location near Chandler mall and had a wonderful meal and experience.  The hostess and wait staff were pleasant and the food was very delicious.",
        "Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. \\n\\nI am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "When we first got here they had a big sign saying something like, please take a cookie upon check-in, but there was no cookies.  Everything in this hotel DATED....stains on everything including shower curtain, bedspreads, towels and carpets.   No towels at the pool.  Not worth it .....no matter what the price is.   The signage is horrible.  Try finding the roof deck pool.",
        "Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\\nand their savory scones.\\n\\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays.",
        "Old hotel but always filled with guest and tourists. The Jaba was a great addition to this hotel!",
        "HORRIBLE SERVICE. I can understand if it's really busy but to have NO ONE come to our table for over 20 minutes for our DRINK order is just ridiculous. \\n\\nNo greet anywhere, no thank you's, and not a smile in sight by most of their staff. If you hate your job that much, why continue working there. \\n\\n2 Stars because I do love their late night specials. Steak and Eggs always a good choice.",
        "hella stuffy.\\nhella no space to dance.\\nloooonnnggeessst wait ever in my life (even my party was on the guestlist).",
        "We tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good.  For about $6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service.  Take a chance and go for the hotter dishes.  :-)",
        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "Mike their \\\"broker\\\" has no personality and is rude on the phone. He is impolite to his costumer and will drop the phone on you, avoid dealing with people like him and move on to the next business that cares about costumer service.",

        "Great club. Diverse crowd including age. Mature place where you don't have to worry about a shooting or \\\"hood\\\" crowd. Very sexy and sophisticated place. Free vodka drinks. Call early and put your name on the guest list to avoid lines. If you can spare a few hundred between friends get a table. It's so worth it.",
        "The oysters here were really good. The price here is very fair for seafood. Although the reason that I'm giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt. We ordered the seafood gumbo and I had to take a gulp of water everytime I took a bite of my gumbo.",
        "I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",
        "Good little neighborhood joint.  The food is good, the pours are reasonable, and the bar top is one awesome hunk of wood.  The decor is that of a golf nut, as the owner a Scots expat.  They've got a loyalty card of sorts and offer specials regularly.",
        "This is really cool. It's a nice lil' hike and adventure to take when visiting the viewpoints and natural history of the Phoenix area. \\n\\nBest to visit at sunset!",
        "fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",
        "Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website.",
        "The food is ok, not mind blowing. It's basically just snack food not real meals. I'd call it a classier Mc Donald's. I purchased a \\\"refillable souvenir cup\\\" but I had to pay $1.00 each time I refilled it. Can you say false advertisement.",
        "Future Tenant is a great non-traditional art gallery. they focus on multi-disciplinary art, so there's always something different going on. they have traditional 2-D art shows, theatre performances, open mic nights, and public window installations. it's a pretty great place for emerging artists to get noticed. and during events there's an open bar, which is always a plus.",
        "Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza. Pizza was just okay. I've had better pizza from chain delivery franchises.  My friends were disappointed and apologetic. Obviously, I won't be back, but neither will they.",
        "This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!",
        "The coffee was very good but the service wasn't the best. The gal and only employee wasn't very friendly or personable. The tables are a little rickety and close together. They do have free wifi, so that was awesome. It was a nice day so they had garage door-style windows open. Very cool. I'd return but would hope it was a bit more inviting in terms of service.",
        "The food is always awesome. The time it takes to come out is a little to long some times. Regardless it's a great place to eat and healthy.\\n\\nEdit: wow the article about their cookie was interesting. To good to be true. :/",
        "This cafe was so good. The raw pizzas and burgers were excellent.  They also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes. The Cookies and Cream' shake was my favorite.  I strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the Vegas area.",
        "I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great.",
        "Decent selection of ice cream and other sweet frozen treats. We went for the cold stone style mixed ice cream. I chose the double chocolate Oreo (Oreos, chocolate chips and sweet cream) and fellow yelper Dorothy C. went with coconut, gummybears, and sprinkles. We decided to go all out and order the chocolate dipped waffle bowls with sprinkles.",
        "My name is Jasen and I am a local Property Manager. I have worked with Mr. Lockout for almost 5 years and they have been complete life savers.

        "Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.\\n\\nAs a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, \\n\\nFood was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like.",
        "The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.",
        "I actually end up spending more time here than I do at my actual apartment. I travel to Charlotte almost weekly for work, and the staff at this hotel is amazing. They are very personable, and extremely accommodating. This is nice to have, since I am rarely home.",
        "I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.",
        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "Going into it, I did have high expectations based on the ratings and reviews I had seen.  My husband and I got cookie dough and cookies & cream.  We both left completely unimpressed with at taste of sour milk in our mouth.  Maybe we just got a bad batch?  I don't think we will be going back again anytime soon.",
        "Our first visit. Sat on the patio and after 10 long minutes had to flag a server. If not for a time crunch my guest and I would have left. Servers all appeared overwhelmed and less than friendly. Not acceptable for upscale Scottsdale establishment on a Friday night. Good management appears to be lacking and it's a shame as this location has all the ingredients to be 4-5 stars consistently.",

        "I'm very excited to try e2 again in the very near future.\\n\\nWe attended a Yelp event at e2 this week and were able to sample some what what they have to offer.  Everything served was fantastic and as I saw food strolling by to lucky hungry tables, I grew even more excited to try more.  This may very well be worth one of the rare 5 star grades and I will update this post as soon as we try it again!",
        "I need to update my previous review. Not sure what happened, but they've gone downhill. It's like a different place. They went from being awesome to unreliable.",
        "I really like Millers but this place is horrible at transitioning from the early to afternoon games on Sundays. The \\\"it'll be on these tv's after these games are over\\\" excuse is unacceptable. All the tv's are showing the same games!!!!  You're telling me with your high tech audio room you can't change some channels? It's either lazy or incompetent.",
        "If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.",
        "The line is always long on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-12. So expect to wait just a little while if you want to go on those days.\\nI would say that the food is okay, although I have had better. The service is so quick, which is really nice when I am hungry in the morning.\\nI should order something that they are known for in order to give them a better rating.",
        "The price tag for the Jimmy Dean Delights turkey sausage bagels said $5.99.  After I got home, I looked at the receipt and noticed I was charged $7.19.  Thanks for the false pricing, Target.  I think that's illegal, too.\\n\\nI'm going to think Twice before I go back to Target.  Might go ahead and close my Red Card too.  Not worth the 5% discount to get overcharged.",
        "Burger was good. Sweet potatoes fries were burned and cold. Cookies were also cold despite website saying they would be warm. Service was courteous and okay for the most part. Food could be improved.",
        "The food is your standard, crappy Chili's food. However, as far as airport Chili's (and even regular Chili's) go, the staff here was the nicest and most efficient I've ever encountered. (Note: No alcohol is served anywhere in the Char airport before noon on Sundays.)",
        "Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans.",
        "I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere",

        "Expensive. They Don't have the red bull sugar gumming bear.\\n\\nOnly cool thing is location.  One of places I stay when I go vegas.",
        "I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "So time for an update, :D The staff definitely stepped it up which is a bonus. They greet you as soon as you're in the door. I ordered the Wellness drink again and YES it was blended but, I just can't knock it, it is DELICIOUS and still healthy also. Didn't order food but, I'd go back for the smoothies they are worth every penny",
        "this place is so delicious and cheap.  Very friendly and fast.\\n\\nAsk for no MSG and free delivery.\\n\\nThey give you a lot of food.  great for a local neighborhood thai place.",
        "This club is more laid back and not so busy compared to some of the other locations which is nice since you never have to wait for machines. The machines could be better maintained; there are several with rips and tears. The front desk clerks aren't very personable. They don't even greet you when you come in and usually leave the scanner on the counter so you'll scan yourself - lazy.",
        "Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again",
        "Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!",
        "This was sad sad place. Even being the weekend the place didn't have many patrons. Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.",
        "Good cut. Yes, it was extremely fast, but they were trying to do 1000 cuts in 7 days (would be the company record. I used to go to the same sports clips in Austin, TX and had the same barber, she was fast, too, but, also cleaned and trimmed my beard, mustache and eyebrows. Not the case today in Robinson. But, then again. I didn't ask. If you want a descent haircut. This place could work.",
        "If I have to shop at any giant eagle in my area, it would be this one. The sq. Hill location has more offerings but the employees all hate their lives and are either flirting with each other, on their phones, conversing with another employee, or just effin rude. The employees at the greenfield location are so much more personable and helpful.",
        "My hubby and I took the kids there and sat outside during happy hour. The service was great, they had decent HH specials on both drinks and food. The kids had fun with the peanuts. We were the only ones outside and our server did a great job of remembering we were out there. I think it would have been pretty pricey to have a full dinner there, but the HH specials made it affordable with 3 kids.",
        "I absolutely love this barre studio! The instructors are so personable and really make an effort to make you feel comfortable. The classes are hard but I always have a great sense of accomplishment after each class. I've been going for several months and have been able to see positive changes in my body. The studio is beautiful and always clean. They also have a studio in Chandler if you live in that part of town. Definitely worth checking out.",
        "Dick's was in the hotel we stayed in. We stopped by to check out the live music which was actually pretty good. The drinks were good but the bartenders were blah. No personality and not real attentive. The bar was rather empty so I would have expected more interaction. I really wasn't impressed but maybe on a more happening night I would have really loved it. I wouldn't go back even if I was staying in the same hotel.",
        "Love the wings at this place they are cooked in the pizza oven . Super crispy .love their breakfast specials For lunch get the get the taco basket !! Service is always good . Food portions are great . Friendly wait staff and bartenders",
        "This place obviously changed their hours and didn't update anything else except the door on their business. Last time I came by, they were closed randomly. Ok, I understand things happen and it's necessary. No problem. However, now they are closed on Sundays and didn't bother to update their answering service or information online. Annoying.",
        "Typical sports bar with great wings! Kitchen Sink Wings were $.50 each the night we went. The fried zucchini was great as well (more breading then zucchini, but it doesn't matter after a few beers). We also tried the nachos and tater tots, which were fine. Service was great! They also have daily beer specials.",
        "Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!",
        "Close and good lunch specials!",
        "Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.",
        "Visited on a busier night than last time and again walked away impressed. Service and food were outstanding. We were celebrating our anniversary and got the memorable meal we were looking for. Sommelier was a bit pretentious but our server was great. Wild mushroom risotto, squid ink rice, and albondigas were standouts.",
        "One of my favorite restaurants, Chez Vous in Scottsdale Arizona, serves Passport Coffee.  It was so good the other day that I had to know where they got it.  I will be ordering my own stash for home use, and will update this review after I git my hands on it!",
        "If you come to Vegas this is a must for drinks but I would pass on the food! Tried almost everything on the food menu and it's not impressive at all... The goblets on the other hand are amazing and a must try! My favorite was the gummy goblet so yummy & fun!",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "I still enjoy Old Chicago after all this time.  Great place with lunch specials, good soups and always something FUN on Tap!   It feels like a true pub and places that seem few and far between these days. PS. They still have the PIZZA thing Down Pat!",
        "Service was awesome. Biblical breakfast was super yummy. Can't wait to go back and try lunch!  Check their Facebook page for specials. Iced coffee had coffee ice cubes how smart!",
        "Their employees are the rudest human beings alive... The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever. Whatever happened to customer service and pleasing guest. They clearly have no mission they are following at this Sugar Factory in particular, the one in Town Square is def. better!",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Space isn't as visually appealing as the other \\\"snow ice\\\" competitor. Lack of printed menus. Order is handwritten on the container.\\n\\nLIKE  The strawberry condensed milk. Usage of natural ingredients. Lighter/fluffier than its competitor. Egg pudding as a topping.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "Just wanted to update. Manager contacted us. Was willing to give full refund or have the top installed for free. Seems there was a communication issue. Issue was resolved, even kept the truck box cover. Did have an issue, but company did resolve in a timely manner and apologized for the miscommunication",
        "I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,",
        "Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day."

        "I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",
        "Great place for an after work drink and appetizers. Went Wednesday night for 1/2 bottle night. Try the meatballs and fried mozzarella, it's the best in town.",
        "Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places.",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "Disappointed because I wanted to send a gift to my Mother and Grandmother for Mother's Day.  Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need.",
        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.",
        "Came here for breakfast one morning in Mandalay. There really weren't a lot of options, but when the food came out there was a ton of it. The eggs seemed a little runny and the bread a little too crisp, but the bacon and the potatoes were yummy.\\n\\nService was good, but the breakfast was pricey. It was $40+ for 2 breakfasts with drinks, but I guess that's Vegas for you.",
        "this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.",
        "This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.",
        "If you are on a salt restricted diet, don't eat here! Everything is over salted and some is actually so salty it is inedible!!!",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "So apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough",
        "Conveniently located. Fine if you just want a quick drink and a sit. They also do takeaway pastry (mediocre looking pastry), sandwiches, and beverages.\\n\\nPeople were totally right about the coffee being too hot though! JEEBUS that stuff was scalding. My latte was out to torture tongues.",
        "We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!",
        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Mediocre galettes and that was a really disappointing thing during my recent trip to Montreal.\\n\\nI told that to my Montrealer friend who said, \\\"told you so\\\". \\n\\nThat being said, their desserts and coffee choices were fantastic. Anything with chocolate, Juliette et Chocolat does okay. Just don't rely on their dinner menu!",
        "Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back.",
        "Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. \\n\\nNegative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.",
        "Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\\n\\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "Good service...Not so much for the food...\\n\\nTwo steaks ordered Medium rare...One arrived med/med-well...The other was blue rare at best...Pretty much raw\\n\\nNoisy and busy but our server was great. I'm sure of we were not pressed for time she would have done the best to mack our food right too!",
        "Nice place, nice atmosphere, and I've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre. I'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist, 'heavy' bread, which I'm sure some people love. I've just discovered Wildflower Bread Company and their bread is 'perfect' for me - drier, lighter, but still with moisture and 'stretch' or 'bite'.",
        "Yummy food; good service.",
        "Twice I've caught Espresso Royale staff overcharging me for my drinks. Mind this if you are ordering a tea latte, because somehow they charge you for a coffee latte instead, which is way more expensive.\\n\\nIn addition, I caught food poisoning from their mango smoothie.",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",
        "Loved the drinks but the service was horrible. We ordered an appetizer that never came (and was later put on the bill). I would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the server's attitude.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "First time eating here last night. Started off with the hummus for an appetizer and got the gyro for my main meal. Everything was excellent..",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "Positives:\\n* The waitress was very nice.\\n* They were open on Christmas Eve.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n* The waitress was not remotely competent.\\n* The beer was skunked.\\n* The fries--which took 15 minutes to arrive--were pale and ice cold.",
        "I have been practicing at Northwest Yoga for just over a year and I absolutely love it!  The environment at the studio is so safe, loving, and welcoming.  The teachers are excellent and give a physical workout as well as a spiritual experience.  Northwest Yoga is a wonderful community that is unpretentious and where you quickly become family.  So glad I found it!",
        "Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back.",
        "The meat department is one of the best I've found.  The marinated meats are not overly salty.  My family loves the pork carne al pastor and marinated flap steak.  \\n\\nThe store is small but clean and the staff are always willing to help.  The select is limited due but what I've bought has all been good quality.",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "I am super glad my guy found this place for me.  It's comfy and yummy.  And, the staff is really thoughtful/friendly.  \\nSee my 'tip' for this fun coffee shop.  ;-)",
        "So delish! Every doughnut I have had has been absolutely amazing! My favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake",
        "Are you kidding me with the salt?  Ordered the steak main course with side of fries.  Could not believe how salty it was....\\n\\nEnjoyed the oysters the most.  But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. \\n\\nToo much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back..",
        "Pretty good but nothing special. Definitely better than IHOP or Denny's, though. Have a few interesting omelettes and scrambles but nothign to really write home about. Would go again if I'm in the area and looking for breakfast but not making a special trip.",
        "Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better.",
        "Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.",
        "Try the Aloha or Tart yogurt. Their toppings are yummy as long as you don't get the pineapple because I'm pretty sure it comes from a can. Gross. But the berries are always fresh. The patio is a bit loud but the location is cute.",
        "Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back.",
        "Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!",
        "A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it.",
        "Mediocre quality food. Tasted fine, but was lukewarm. The fries were cold and I recieved half a cup of fries. Not a good experience at all for over $20. Will not eat here again.",
        "I stop by about ounce a month with my wife it's out the way for me but well worth it the bay of pigs rocks a must go.",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "Beware! Place has become pretentious. Cover for women now and expensive drinks.",
        "Excellent food and service.  Love this place!   We had the enchiladas with steak    The guacamole was yummy too.  This is now my favorite Mexican resturant!!!",
        "Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\\n\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nGood portions.\\n\\nAffordable.",
        "YUMMY!!!! Can't go wrong with Panera. The thing that urks me most is the single door entrance/exit...this place needs double doors with all the people going through it!",
        "Great food and good service. The variety of empanadas is great. Dessert selection of empanadas is yummy. Good drink selection... Bottled drinks, beer too I think? Atmosphere is great; excellent spot for quick lunch.",
        "The response for the JT was nice but those burns were from the wires at the gates of hell and not a rug burn as he claims.\\n\\nI would never go here again and would caution anyone to go there and waste their money. JT response is another example of how rude these people are and how much they disrespect patrons who attend their attractions.\\n\\nAvoid at all cost!",
        "This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled.",
        "Oysters good. Chicken was smelly. Adult tater tots good. Took our servicer for.ever. to split our checks. Mediocre across the board.",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "I love their pizzas\\nAnd now they have pastas, and they're awesome too!\\n\\nI still prefer Postino's bruschetta... but I can't seem to put my finger on why.  I think it might be the bread....",
        "Kind of a long drive from the heart of town but the casino is nice and clean.  You won't smell like smoke when you leave.  Decent machines and dining options.  The spa is nice.  I am a local so I have never stayed in their rooms.  The lattes from Baby Cakes are super.   Great sports book too.",
        "I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!",
        "When I think of \\\"Big Burritos\\\" I think of Los Fav's or Chipolte Burros. These burros, while yummy, are not filling. I expected more burro for $9! Throw in some chips and a drink for that price.",
        "Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty.",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Very good foie gras and pork belly over rice.  Price is decent compares to San Francisco.  Great service located in a unique location.  Reservation yes.  Great cocktail and sake menu.  For sure not for kids.  I will come back .",
        "If I could give this place a million stars, I would. This is by far my favorite restaurant of all time. You must try the Gorgonzola Mac n cheese, creamed corn and of course, the Butter Cake. I would eat here every day if I could!! It always our go to spot for holidays, birthdays and anniversaries! YUMMY! A must try!!",
        "BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.",
        "Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking.",
        "Like most of this franchise the service sucks (slooooooowwwww) and the food is no better than mediocre.  Add to this a lack of talent and you basically have Bennigans.",
        "This is a great, quality Taco Bell recently built with fast service and consistant food. I love Taco Bell because it's cheap and yummy!",
        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.",
        "ive been here a few times. every time ive tried something different and always seems to be a bit salty. the last time i was there, they seemed to have mistaken me ordering capers instead of basil and got home to a nasty surprise. and they put a tone of those nasty little things in my pasta and really ruined it for me.",
        "The ghetto Albertson's. My friend always wants to go grocery shopping at this place. I just don't like this particular location, the food quality isn't the greatest, the selection is mediocre.. Try another Albertson's location.",

        "Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it.",
        "This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",
        "Are there twice while staying at the Mirage. There was a little bit of a wait, the food was delicious. I had the biscuits with gravy and the potato hash. Delicious! Had pancakes and bacon. Yummy too!  This place will be on my list for the next trip to Vegas. Plus it's 24 hours. Can't beat that!",
        "Yummy tacos. Open late. People I ate there with last night are still raving about how good their food was. Have a variety of different meat to choose from",
        "Good portions and cocktails overall. The best thing I tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer. Stay away from the curry chicken, it was small and didn't have much chicken in it.",
        "Take out Pizza with out the grease! The pizza's from La Favourita are amazing - fact! MY favorita is the Capricciosa with extra anchovies followed by the Tiramisu. We had them last night after an afternoon of gardening which works up an appetite and a half I can tell you. Two large pizzas, between three and we were happy garden gnomes sat in the sun with a bottle of red. Lovely",
        "Get an espresso drink, the brewed coffee (caf\\u00e9 filtre) is mediocre and a little stale tasting.",

I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.",

        "Absolutely delicious food! My boyfriend and I went there in search of big plates with lots of flavor and this place exceeded our expectations. We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",
        "I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!"

Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.",

Or maybe they were to lazy to fix the issue. Either way they handled it terribly. And the service was lacking. Bleh.",

        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet.

I'm okay with compromising when he's that excited about it though. \\n\\nHe really wanted a Great Steak, which is technically a cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato. We just ordered one to split. I wasn't as excited about it as he was, but that's life.",
        "The oysters here were really good. The price here is very fair for seafood. Although the reason that I'm giving this place only 3 stars is because our main entree was drenched in salt. We ordered the seafood gumbo and I had to take a gulp of water everytime I took a bite of my gumbo.",
        "This place is great. We purchased the smoked prosciutto, hard salami, and peperoni when we stopped in.

        "The meat department is one of the best I've found.  The marinated meats are not overly salty.  My family loves the pork carne al pastor and marinated flap steak.  \\n\\nThe store is small but clean and the staff are always willing to help.  The select is limited due but what I've bought has all been good quality.",

        "Wow! Even after the good reviews here, I was still surprised at how great food was. I had the edamame soup, pommes frites, and steamed pork bun with a glass of '06 Nebbiolo, and it was complete bliss. I'll be coming back when I'm in town!!",

Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.",
        "Awful sushi! Not friendly at all. The waitress had such a bad attitude. Never again. Not even for free!!!!!!",
        "Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service",
        "This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.",
        "this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.  I recently posted a review of the wrong Takamatsu. This is the one I went to.",
        "This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \\n\\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\\n\\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \\n\\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree.",
        "Lisa gave me a great cut.  I am very fussy about my short hair.  At 60 years old I want a stylish haircut but not to look like I am trying to be 20.  Lisa found the perfect balance, a cute,fun cut, perfect for summer.  I've already scheduled another cut and highlights for later this summer.",
        "Eat lunch here today, ordered a beer any tacos, the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip, the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill... Thanks for the cut lip.",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",
        "Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more.",
        "Meh. Pretty boring in my opinion. I cant think of any particular segments were I thought it was funny/cool. \\n\\nThe last 10minutes was entertaining though. Or maybe I was just excited for the show to finally be over. I dont know. \\n\\nDont recommend.. at all.",
        "Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!",
        "I gave this sushi place a try, since it's around Summerlin(where I live). It was a to-go order. The sushi were not well made. They rolls don't look presentable. One of the rolls I got is a salmon roll. To my surprise, the salmon is cooked not fresh.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. \\n\\nI am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.",
        "Sushi was just okay.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "Nice place to stop and have lunch within the Ghost town.\\n\\nThe decor is old fashioned, cowboy music, very interesting. It is nicely air-conditioned inside.\\n\\nThere is a selection of steak, burgers, cold sandwiches available.\\n\\nI had the mammoth burger which was pretty good, nice and juicy with mushrooms. It was very filling.\\n\\nWould recommend, since there are very few restaurants in this area.",
        "Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. \\n\\nNegative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous. People pushing you as if they were giving out free drinks or something.\\nWe actually enjoyed the other part of the pool area better. Plus, you can still hear the music from there, so why not?",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "A show you can count on for some great laughs.  Carrot Top has tons of funny props and sound effects.  I would recommend it.",
        "This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!",
        "First time at this restaurant because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. The service was superb, no doubt. But the fried chicken was tasteless, sushi was ordinary at best. After more than $50 later, both my hubby and I ended up spending the night in the bathroom.",
        "I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.",
        "Had the King crab legs--hard to give it anything but 5 stars, but it was pricey.  It's a great restaurant, but in a town of great restaurants, it's 4 stars.",
        "Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "Love this place! Great sushi and Korean. Although I mostly go for the sushi",
        "My son went and got us subs for dinner last night.   I had the JJBLT.   Not good.   The bacon had an odd taste, and, despite my request for \\\"Crispy\\\", it was soggy.   I ended up eating a lettuce, mayo and tomato sandwich.  Disappointing consumption of calories.",
        "By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!",
        "I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "royal mile is beautiful, it's a lovely cobbled street that runs on a hill with pubs and shops and restaurants on either side. when it's empty it's great to walk down and when it's really busy during the festival with people advertising their plays it's even more awesome. i love it.",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",
        "Sushi Wa -  the ambiance here is nice, modern chic. \\n    We had a huge party of 24, made a reservation the set up was quite confusing. But we got it handled. \\n     Obviously 24 people could get pretty confusing for AYCE but the server was patient. He did forget things at times but we we tried to be patient and understanding. \\n\\n  Quality of sushi was good. I liked how they actually have sashimi in the AYCE",
        "After 10 PM they stop serving mashed potatoes. Service is usually slow. The cooks don't really know how to cook properly. Not impressed at all. If you want a sit down late night, go to Arizona Charlie's.",
        "$18 bucks w/ tax for all you can eat sushi/bbq/whatever.\\n\\nMy favorites - sake sushi, orange chicken, lo mein, and the fried sesame rice balls.\\n\\nFor all-you-can eat, it has a good price and food that actually tastes decent.  That's tough to beat.",
        "My question this is a great Costco, but why do they charge more for gas than any other Costco iin the area.  Overcharging their very good customers.\\nI had a pepperone slice  of pizza on Saturday, but there was no cheese on the pizza. just sauce and pepperoni.",
        "Is the food good? Yes\\n\\nHowever you'll have a nicer dining experience at a fast food place. We arrived at 6:30 and we're out the door by 7:02 and not by choice.",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease. After one rather difficult appointment, Dr. Rapp called the next day to check on my daughter and make sure she was feeling well.",
        "Try the Aloha or Tart yogurt. Their toppings are yummy as long as you don't get the pineapple because I'm pretty sure it comes from a can. Gross. But the berries are always fresh. The patio is a bit loud but the location is cute.",
        "Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.\\n\\nI goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation. \\n\\nI recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible.",
        "Great little tacos on Fremont St. Carne Asada tacos and spanish rice were good. Cheep eats and open late!",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  \\n\\nLast time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood.",
        "I used to go to the Three Brothers on the Atlantic City boardwalk all the time when I was growing up on the east coast. I can't believe there's one right up the street from me now. The pictures in the place bring back so many memories. I've only gotten pizza there, so I can only provide my opinion on that, but with the dough shipped from the east coast daily, how could you go wrong?",
        "The catfish sucks is hella fishy! The sides where to die for !and the waters are so nice I would go agian for the sides !the drinks are served in like mason jars it is the cutest thing ! Yams and the Mac is something to get !(:",
        "Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress \\nGreat mac n cheese appetizer\\nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible\\nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting \\nVery overrated restaurant\\nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",
        "It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "Large Beef Burrito with homemade Tortilla was great.  Tacos were filled with fresh Beef, Cheese, Onions, Lettuce & Tomatoes served w/ a side of Beans AND Rice. We all had soft drinks and the bill was under $20!  Friendly service and the bathrooms are clean.  PS Margarita's are a $1.00 OFF on Friday's.",
        "The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.",
        "(This review is for Las Vegas ie: The Strip)\\n\\nWent to Las Vegas on the weekend for a friends 30th B'day celebration.\\n\\nIt quickly dawned on me that LV is everything I hate about the USA in one location. Mindless gambling drones, drunk red-neck frat boys at 2 in the afternoon, plastic barbies, the excess of it all.\\n\\nThe one star is for the flight home.",
        "Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.",
        "Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.",
        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "Great food and good pricing. The sushi is great and I've never gotten fishy or old sushi here! Great for kids, just wish they had the children's chopsticks available. Good atmosphere and outside dining with lake view available.",
        "The response for the JT was nice but those burns were from the wires at the gates of hell and not a rug burn as he claims.\\n\\nI would never go here again and would caution anyone to go there and waste their money. JT response is another example of how rude these people are and how much they disrespect patrons who attend their attractions.\\n\\nAvoid at all cost!",
        "cute place. great food!",
        "I really enjoyed my stay here and will be back!\\nHighly recommend if your looking for a top tier hotel off the strip. \\nEverything from the room, staff, grounds were just about flawless.\\nOnly gripe was with the quality of the restaurants and buffet which just really all needs to be revamped.",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "UGH!! A Wolfgang Puck Chinese restaurant. Need I say more? I hate PF Chang's and any restaurant(s) resembling it. \\n\\nTake a good look at the clientele and you'll get an idea what sort of food you're about to eat.\\n\\nExpensive and not good. Why would anyone even consider eating here?",
        "I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!",
        "The best sushi in vegas hands down my girlfriend and i love this place",
        "I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.",
        "If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.",
        "The line is always long on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-12. So expect to wait just a little while if you want to go on those days.\\nI would say that the food is okay, although I have had better. The service is so quick, which is really nice when I am hungry in the morning.\\nI should order something that they are known for in order to give them a better rating.",
        "Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego.",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess.",
        "an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!",
        "Best sushi I have had in Charlotte!",
        "love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular.",
        "They announced today they are closing. As you can see due to my previous review I am not surprised. Sad but not suprised.",
        "One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!",
        "Horrible horrible service!!!! What happened to this place?\\nFood is good and fresh. I refuse to go here during normal hours but if I'm craving sushi at 2am then I'd stop by. Otherwise I will drive way across town to Yama Sushi for excellent service and food! So sad to see this place fall apart..",
        "stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam. Pretty good pizza, nice local little spot. we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita. Both were pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich. solid 3 stars"
