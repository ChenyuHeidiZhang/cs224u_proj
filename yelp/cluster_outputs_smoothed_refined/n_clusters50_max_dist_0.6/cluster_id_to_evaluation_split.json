        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "I was very disappointed base on all the good reviews. The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min. Service was very slow and had to ask multiple times for bread and water. Hate to say this but Outback is MUCH better. Will probably never return or recommend to friends",
        "Man, Village Inn... is the best.  Came here twice in the last two years (not from the area) and definitely made a point to come in on Wednesday for free pie, y'all!!  Seriously who can beat that.  \\n\\nHad the strawberry banana french toast once and then a dinner entree another and they were all sooo gooood omg.",
        "Napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes, the lobster and and soups are great, but the crab was bitter.",
        "Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.",
        "Killer shakes (salted dulce de leche is my fav), delicious burgers and tacos.  Takes a while to get your food but so worth it.",
        "I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!",
        "Decent food. The pizza is really cheap and when I got it I realized why it was so cheap not that great. The reason I gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie. Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley.",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",
        "Ok tacos and margaritas.  Nothing to write home about",
        "love it here! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site. Its a pretty big place, there are always seats inside and out, which is really nice. The service was great and very friendly. They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it, so totally worth the extra calories :)",
        "La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",
        "We are in Vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just can't find anywhere else. Yayo Taco was excellent!!! I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go...",
        "I love this place, who eats a hot dog in fry bread.   You will if you go to Indian Village.   Great tacos, fry bread and burritos.   Stop at the Circle K next door and get a sixy of your favorites to enjoy with the best mexican food in Cave Creek.",
        "Despite really knowing their stuff when it comes to Mediterranean food (killer falafel and baba ganoush), I now also think of them for great thin crust pizza.  The atmosphere is super cool too - try sitting outside at night.",
        "Ohai.  Tacos are good but expensive and so are the fresca.  Try to make it to happy hour(no food just drinks) Use coupons when able. Kthxbai",
        "Cafe Myriade is a cute little coffee shop serving 49th Parallel Coffee.\\n\\nComing here with high expectation and was a little disappointed!\\n\\nBoth Americano and Cappuccino we ordered were both overly fruity to even sour.\\n\\nThe search of a great cup of espresso drink continues....maybe I just stuck to drinking beers!",
        "I was charged $130 for a $60 tire, $20 for $10 tire tape, and $20 to put the tire on the rim. Outrageous",
        "Don't stay here. The room was in poor condition upon check-in. The restroom smelled like someone took a massive dump. The sheet was stained red which I am hoping is from cranberry juice. Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.",
        "Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.",
        "I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!",
        "Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!",
        "Best margaritas in town!\\n\\nFood is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!",
        "Food is just good, not great. Vanilla custard French toast is good. Omelets are a little bland. Corn beef hash was sweet and spicy...it is made in house.",
        "Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!!  Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had!  I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "Love this place. I usually order for pick up and i usually make my own pizza. Grilled chicken with jalapeno. The crust and sauce are amazing. If you decide to dine in they have specials like 2 slices of cheese and a drink for around $5.95, I think? But the food is always good and service is always on point. I'm definitely a regular here.",
        "Good place to grab breakie in Scottsdale. I had the traditional Benedict and it was quite tasty. Service was fast and friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all. We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast.",
        "Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "ordered online...got there at time I requested and they said they just got order. The pizza was burnt and the rest a wet soggy mess..when I talked to kitchen manager I was informed that it is the fault of ordering a thin crust and vegatarian. Yes they gave me a credit...Only an apology when I mentioned I had not received one,,,only excuses.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \\\"yeah I know it's bad.\\\" \\nWon't be going back.",
        "Came in at lunchtime, first thing very noisy! Margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos . Enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic",
        "I love the New York style pizza here!!! If you haven't tried it, you've got to!! One of my favorite pizza spots I've grown up eating!! I'm not a huge Ranch/on my pizza pie, but my buddies swear by their secrete recepe here! The Buffalo Chicken Strips taste so great and just being here brings back memories...",
        "The rolled tacos were like chewing hard rubber and the carne asada burrito had a stale tortilla around bland meat.\\n\\nHaving enjoyed Robertos in other cities, I was very disappointed in the quality here and will not be back.",
        "This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.",
        "This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "The carne asada tacos are definately worth while!!! Large size corn tortilla, good amount of meat a d great flavor! They seen to have a good selection of other authentic Mexican food! Will go again",
        "We like to go here for Tapas happy hour!  Fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharing.\\n\\nIt's a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza (there's a kid's menu).  \\n\\nService is usually pretty good.",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \\\"chicken\\\" tacos.",
        "Decent food. Ordered the Sicilian pizza not knowing what it really was. The crust was super crunchy I was hoping for doughy. Place is really nice inside and the service was good.  Huge portions. I don't think ill return just wasn't for me. But is worth a try",
        "Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...\\n\\nPassed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus",
        "Everything is good. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Mole =)",
        "Was super impressed with the fish tacos. Same taste and fell as cali. Also the 3 rolled tacos were amazing as well. Service was good, friendly staff and love option of having beer. Didn't like the bar being separated from dinner room. All in all great food, and great healthy choices.",
        "Delish! I really liked this Chelsea's we ate on the patio and it was beautiful. The food was really good I had the fillet tacos and they were perfect! The key lime pie was the best I've ever had and the service was great!",
        "Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!",
        "I had been frequenting another North Shore location for years but I thought I would give Rivertowne a try and it was good. I had the baked Italian sub and it was tasty, cold beer, intimate space, nice views, plenty of TV's, all good. The service could be faster and more personable and cleanliness could be better but all-in-all a pleasant experience and I will be back.",
        "Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.",
        "Solid.  In and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet.  \\n\\nNice staff and good service.",
        "Had a chance to try the crustless quiche today - works for gluten free. It had a good flavor, not over cooked and fresh ingredients. They are working on a gluten free crust for the pot pies and quiches. The meatless one today hit the stop. I'll try them again.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",
        "Great pork belly tacos.Small plates nice to try many items.Has good energy buzzing.Definitley will be returning next time in Charlotte.",
        "My esteemed colleague on Facebook just mentioned that one is now open in WEST COVINA! Yes, still far, but way closer than Vegas! AWESOME!\\n\\nWest Covina\\n2200 South Azusa Avenue\\nWest Covina, CA 91792\\nUS\\nPhone: 626-839-4222\\nFax: 626-839-5956",
        "TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix.",
        "Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.",
        "Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.",
        "Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.",
        "Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos.",
        "Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!\\n\\nThis is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good.",
        "This place is very small but packs a huge flavorful punch to your taste buds! Made me an instant fan! I had the #1 carne machado, beef empanada & the coconut with cheese pastelito. I also tried the guava & cheese pastelito, that thing was amazing! I loved every morsel of all the good food I was able to try.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "The food is good but I'm disappointed at the stinginess .. They give plastic ware but I ask for 4 paper plates and was told I have to pay a dollar a piece? Really? Horrible business practice over something like plates!",
        "This place is fantastic! Lots of healthy options from a very knowledgable and friendly staff. I highly recommend the Mock Tacos entree and the curried chickpea salad. The Jamaican Hibiscus iced tea is also to die for.",
        "Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back.",
        "Forget the tablecloth-and-white-glove joints. I walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu, but was even more impressed with the healthy options available. I had an omelet and wheat toast, and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm - and I'm not a small guy.",
        "This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled",
        "I am shocked.  Only one review for ETHD.  A Phoenix institution. \\n\\nThousands of us do jury duty.  Ed's is a must stop on jury day.  Especially for the Chicago Dog.  He has all the napkins you need, plus places to sit.",
        "I really wanted to like this place but the portion sizes was tiny. I had there bento box with Chicken Teriyaki but there was more vegetables then chicken. It should have been called  Vegetables Teriyaki. Too much money for too little food. After dinner I went out to get another meal to satisfy my less than full stomach!",
        "Good crust. Overall an upgraded little ceaser or howies. Mostly take out setup. Hugh delivery area.",
        "Well Pie Zanos is no longer at the location on 75th Ave and Bell.   After a short stint here it looks like they packed up everything and moved to 51st Ave and Bell.  The new address on their website is 5060 West Bell Rd.  I hope the change in venue works out for them.",
        "Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \\n\\nThe bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu.",
        "the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy",
        "Atmosphere was well done,  good service but for a $20 medium pie there was no real wow factor,  good but $20 good.",
        "Pie in the Sky's pizza is way better than Fuel's, hands down. I would absolutely recommend this place, especially if you need to order for an inexpensive business lunch. I have never been dissappointed! My favorite pizzas are the Supreme and the BBQ Chicken, but they are all good. Also, get the Greek salad. They don't skimp on toppings and the dressing is great. Love this place.",
        "yummaaaaaaay....open till midnight! Chill outside on the patio at night, or during the day if its not 110 degrees. Fresh veggies, tasty blue cheese dip. Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient.",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Not cheap @ $4.50 for a cheese slice and $24 for a whole pie. But definitely tasty. Even when you're not that hungry, so that says something! LOL  Will definitely try other menu items next time I return!",
        "yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too.",
        "Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  \\nA few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!.",
        "Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation.",
        "Great pizza. Get a regular pie well done, as close to NYC style as you can get. They have great daily specials as well.",
        "CC Sizzle on a sopapilla was awesome.  Like a super flavorful puffy taco.  The wife had the chicken tacos and mentioned the fresh tasting corn tortillas.  We also got a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa.  Everything was fantastic. \\n\\nAlso, the guy and lady working there were super nice and polite the whole time, major points for that.  I'll be returning.",
        "I was the only customer, service good, the spaghetti sauce must of been out of a can plane as could be. Meatballs hard no taste. The Italian combo sub was like eating the sole of a shoe. The appetizer tomato.and garlic toast was very good. The atmosphere was nice. For $31 left very very DISAPPOINTED will NEVER GO BACK. I hope the owner reads this.",
        "We tried a half dozen of these greasy, pretentious donuts. We didn't finish any of them. They had a mix of stale textures and weird tastes. Just bad. I can't believe I'm saying that about a donut. We really hated them.",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the full tasting menu with one wine pairing.\\n\\nThe dishes were very original and the presentation of each dish was extraordinary!\\n\\nEverything was beyond our expectation!\\n\\nBravo!",
        "These guys have the best churros in town.\\n\\nThey are amazing and the staff is very friendly\\n\\nGood price too 12 filled churros for 16.50$ you cant go wrong with that.\\n\\nThey also have more latin food like many different empanadas like beef, spicy beef, corn, tuna and many many more.",
        "Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style."

        "After seeing my 2nd show here, I can say it will be my last.  Super over-priced drinks, and if you aren't near the stage, it's almost impossible to get a good view.

The only good thing about this mall opening is that it makes seeing a weekend night movie at the Esplanade a bit more pleasant, clearly this is the happening place to be for yuppie spawn and I couldn't be happier.",
        "I didn't think I liked Carrot Top, but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show.  I am so glad I did!  It was hilarious.  A must see in Vegas!",
        "Great performances and acts! The main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate. I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",
        "Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!",
        "I'm writing this at the bar at BRI. I just finished the stacked enchilada. So very good!! It was pretty spicy but not in an overwhelming way. Super tasty!! \\n\\nThe other night I had the Spanglish sandwich. That was another huge winner!! \\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty good too!\\n\\nYou should check this spot out!",
        "I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",
        "blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM",
        "this place is good for family,  The price is right and they serve good beer.  The food is pretty good four stars are for the service.  I don't like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Went here at 1am on Black Friday. The place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casino.\\n\\nOxtail Soup was the only thing worth trying. Ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside. Also tried the steak and it was pretty bland. One trick pony in my opinion.",
        "Best Buffet I've been to in Vegas so far, but that's not really saying much seeing that I've only been to a couple.  They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF / Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent.",
        "This place visually is nice, as far as the attitude of staff and service don't expect too much unless you are the money mogul type. This place is ran by old school people that still lives in the 1930's. They try to pass off as if they are hardcore bad asses or something, especially on the craps tables.\\n\\nI am sorry to say but this place is stuck up, but hey, i guess it is to be expected that's life.",
        "I used to eat here, the service wasnt so great, seemed like the staff was snooty. I only liked 2 items on the menu. If you want good food with good scenery and nice friendly staff go up the road to twin peaks.",
        "What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!",
        "Went here last night for the first time last night... Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)",
        "Have to admit that I have not been to many clubs in Las Vegas. However, we decided to check it out. We ended up waiting in line for two hours which soured my mood. Once we got in, the place was smaller than I expected and there was one dj on the stage. There were lots of asians and indians at this club. The dance floor was so crowded that I could hardly move. The outdoor area was also too small.  I think Tao is much better.",
        "Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem, lack of posting for the appropriate tee off locations.\\nPlease mark by colors at each tee off. Provide better signage for those of us who are new to this course. Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate.",
        "Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.",
        "Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro. I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.  I love that she knows how I like my hair cut and make sure that I don't chop it all off. Mara offers fantastic hair cuts for a great price! She offers hair coloring services and she does amazing work. She's the best secret in Phoenix!",
        "Rising Sun and Golden Standard is definitely a must have! They use Kobe and Dry aged beef! Awesome beer selection and the ambiance absolutely fit the 'cosmopolitan' feel. If you want to skip the line to Marquee on Friday or Saturday, hang out here. Same Dj, less crowds, better drinks.. I mean where else can you have a burger and fist pump??",
        "The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip.",
        "This place isn't worth your time. There are FAR better bowling venues in town.\\n\\nSo what's wrong with Arsenal Bowling? Rude staff. Slow bar with limited selection. It's cramped and dirty. Lanes are reserved pretty much 24/7. Misleading specials (other have posted about this).\\n\\nI try to be an easy-going guy, but after trying this place a few times I'm done giving it another chance.",
        "So we end up at XS after being unable to get in to Hakkansan and trust me we were not disappointed! This place is incredible the inside was gorgeous and the outside was a great spot to enjoy the music and get some fresh air.\\n\\nWe end up seeing Rusko  and dancing the night which was a blast.  I would defiantly recommend checking it out here!",
        "Its perfect for checking out fleshy new tat's on beautiful punk rock chicks. But its not a real good place to be dressed up at. Definetly go in something greaser-ish, biker-ish or in just plain chill clothes... This place reminds me of some clubs up in Seattle.\\nGood atmosphere, decent dj although he could get a larger selection of discs.",
        "After seeing all the other Cirque shows in Vegas first, I was a little let down by Mystere.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a good show.  It just can't compare side by side to \\\"O\\\" or \\\"Ka\\\" with their higher tech stages.  The performers were great but halfway through the show I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  See this first...then see the other shows.",
        "This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",
        "Wow... I wish they had a place like this in NYC.  I'd set up a tent outside and never leave.  This is an incredible market.  The variety and quality of the food available is amazing... and the prices seem quite reasonable considering.  I was there for hours and felt like I didn't have enough time to explore.  I sampled a lot of produce and ate at a few of the restaurants around the market.  Well done Montreal!!",
        "Now this is my kind of church!!  I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing when I made my first visit earlier this week!  It was a real church, serving food and beer.....and I loved it!  We had the wood-fired pizza and some Celestial Gold.  Beer was good, and pizza (Spinach, Feta and Artichoke) was excellent.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely return!",
        "i spent the better part of a slightly drizzly afternoon here last week.  so so pretty.  even with the cold and the rain. seeing lovely things like jewels and crowns and all the various nooks and crannies to be found was quite lovely.  the admission's a bit steep, but it's really a must-do in edinburgh. the views of the city are to die for and the history is fascinating.",
        "Closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am... We saw people inside and the waiters saw us, but ignored us. \\n\\nChange your closing time to 2am so people won't be trying to come at 2:15am to a closed establishment.",
        "the waterfall behind the dj is the only amazing thing about this place. It's filled with 40 yr olds, and they play top 40 songs mixed with random hip-hop music. Makes me feel like im at an 18+ club with creepers all over again...even the go-go dancers don't seem to enjoy it",
        "I was here for my 21st birthday. It was a lot of fun, but it was rather small. It felt like they were double their max capacity. The dj was awesome, but again the dance floor was too small and crowded :(",
        "While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!",
        "Drinks special can be a good deal if you like to drink fast.  The Club is in an OK location and is a pretty small venue.  The Comics they get are OK but you get what you pay for.  Not a bad night out if you have already seen all the cool shows in Vegas.  The seating is banquet style chairs and if in the back you will have a hard time seeing.   Doing VIP is a must...",
        "WOW! Everything we ordered was so fresh and awesome. We wil return here again. We ate here before seeing Le Reve'. AS the show was wonderful, so was  Red 8.\\n\\nService was so exceptional. It is one of the best Asian we have eaten, in Las Vegas.",
        "Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike).",
        "This was one of my few choices for food at 2am...c'mon, Vegas!\\n\\nWhile limited, the late night menu was good, albeit pricey.  The Asian wings were fabulous!",
        "My mother and I came here for Christmas Eve and we were SO PLEASED with the ensemble-style waitstaff. I had the surf and turf and she had the dual lobster tails. Perfectly prepared seafood, very light and buttery--but filling! Amazing ambiance, great food presentation. We came for the view, fell in love with the food. Had no room for dessert! We thought the photographer was a little aggressive, but she took some great photos.",
        "I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \\\"Subway Effect\\\" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",
        "I never could have pulled of my photo shoot in my mothers dress without Jaime! She is just simply amazing! I loved her so much, I am having her do my makeup for wedding and my entire bridal party! Hire her! She rocks!",
        "Way better than what I expected!  It's three floors of conspiracy, blood and bootlegging.  Parts of it are graphic so if you're squeamish, you may want to pass on the crime scene photos.  It could not be in a more apropos location than Vegas.  \\n\\nI got $2 off for checking in with Yelp.  It's a nice distraction from the casinos.",
        "Food is good but service is awful!!! We went twice and each time it's the same thing, takes forever to get waited on, servers don't check back to see if you need anything and one time they took so long to wait on us that dim sum ended. Don't waste your time go to Changs on Decatur instead! I would not recommend unless you want subpar food at over the top prices.",
        "So nice having this place in the neighborhood. Great sausages, including summer sausage. Have also enjoyed steaks, bacon, chicken, etc. DJ is really helpful and will try to get you whatever you need.",
        "Looking for an upscale sexy pizza place with a DJ spinning some music for your date tonight? This is the place. The pizza is yummy and the atmosphere is great. DJ yes dancing No. Disclaimer: I don't recommend this place for large groups especially if you are super hungry.",
        "Pros: Nicely laid out store with a wide variety of vintage merchandise.\\nCons:  Booths are not individually signed with percentage off discounts for store sales which makes things rather confusing.  Employees are hard to identify as they don't wear aprons, badges, etc.  Your purchase will be wrapped in used newspaper instead of clean wrapping paper.  All things that can be improved upon for a better shopping experience.",
        "A dying breed, unfortunately. You wonder how long before B&N is gone. Hopefully not for a while. Nothing like the smell of bound paper and coffee. It's comforting. \\nEnjoy it while you can, tons of books, magazines, music and the experience of actually holding a book, physically flip through its pages, rather than electronically. Can't beat it",
        "Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said",
        "Soaking up the Downtown scene and seeing all the new changes they've made... I gotta say I'm thoroughly impressed with all the establishments in here and the little community they've built. The Vegas vibe is nonexistent in this community which is a refreshing change up from the vegas scene. I highly recommend everyone living here and visiting to check it out! Good job Tony Hsieh :)",
        "I went to have dinner there and the service was not great at all, it took them 20 minutes to finally acknowledge I was there and asked if I wanted a menu. I ordered sliders and a drink, it had nothing special to it, the food is less than average. I would rather go to BJs down the street on Decatur than bother going there again. Waste of time, waste of money.",
        "One of the top 3 Clubs in Vegas!!\\n\\nThe place is pretty nice but they have the Best DJ's From all over plus Monday nights are free for locals!!",
        "I walked into Stitched and into heaven.  The clothes are amazing and Jack was friendly and very helpful.  I'm going back tomorrow to check more clothes out.  Jack is the bomb!  Very soon I will have a new wardrobe of fabulousness!  Highly recommended for the individually fashion minded.",
        "All-in-all, we enjoyed the food at Damas tonight, and it brings us pride as Syrians after seeing the rave reviews it got in the media and on blogs.  Hopefully Montrealers will now know how Syrian cuisine really differs from its more common Lebanese counterpart.  The restaurant still needs to work a bit on its service, but we will definitely be back.",
        "Definitely loved KA!!  Visually stunning and beautiful.  This was my second Cirque du Soleil.  Definitely worth the $$$.  You'll never see anything else like it. \\n\\nBut as much as I loved KA, I still loved O so much more because of the water.  Sorry.\\n\\nBoth are awesome!!!!!",
        "Stumbled in here seeing they actually had a happy hour on Sunday and it exceeded every single expectation! Katie our bartender was very sociable, knowledgeable, and especially sweet. Had the ahi poke (I wanted another one) fish tacos, burger sliders, goat cheese spread and my absolute favorite was the crab bisque. Quick chat with Kevin, the manager and the grapefruit basil cocktail made it the perfect Sunday dinner date with the other half.",
        "One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!",
        "The service was unorganized and the hostess was rude. We karaoke'd with friends and the DJ playing the music was also rude. We won't be going back.",
        "Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.",
        "Six of us dined prior to seeing Celtic Women last night.  Very disappointing, very!  Made our reservation 2 weeks prior to going to Bravo Franco.  Hostess wanted to seat 6 of us at a bar window!  Portions were ridiculously small on the Virginia Spots, three meals should have equaled one.  Mentioned this to the waitress and she did nothing to rectify.  Bread pudding dessert was not good.  Taste was bland and service mediocre.  Will not be going back, ever!",
        "I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley.",
        "Great food & fun atmosphere!\\nIt is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park.\\nmmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!",
        "One of my favorite \\\"cheap eats\\\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo",
        "Upscale. Expensive. But the food and service are beyond compare. The restaurant is merely a block from the Belk theater, so it's great for dinner beforehand or drinks afterwards. Look at their website to really get a look into this restaurant & how they serve their proteins, individually off of \\\"spits\\\". Filet mignonette, ribeye, pork, scallops, shrimp, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken etc.",
        "hard to rate a massage place, seeing as they definitely make you feel better than when you came in. it should be \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\" rating. whatever the case, the mo membership is worth it.",
        "Big waste of money!  I saw his show on August 23, 2013 and I was very much looking forward to seeing him! The best part of everything was the hype!  His show was slow, boring, and did not have any real things that make you saw wow!  I can't believe I spent roughly $170 for the show and walked out after the show having to apologize for the bad experience and waste of time to my fianc\\u00e9e.  See anyone else!",
        "***WARNING*** Dr. Nishihara can and will help your children, that's only if you don't mind being disrespected in front of them and brought to tears on some visits.  He is rude and obviously has no children of his own. I will no longer be seeing this Doctor because I feel we have been in a verbally abusive relationship and are finally free of the bullying despite his education.",
        "Started with a physically and verbally pissed guy for having to work OT, so they changed techs after I objected to his attitude, then the owner said he would take care of me. In the end he charged me full price and kept asking for a tip. Spa treatments are to be relaxing. Hindsight I should of just left.",
        "This my favorite show!!!!!! I first saw this show last year because I had a coupon and had such a good time I had to go back this year and see it again! Tina is by far my favorite! I will be seeing this show every time I go back to vegas, it is a must. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an energetic, fun, entertaining show!!!",
        "Cool layout big bar! But the girls? Alot of them look like there on drugs. I say they ranged from zeros to a couple of 5s. Sad to say watching the customers was more amusing than watching the girls. Not only were they not cute, but their dancing was WACK. the dj played pretty good music tho. Drinks were weak. I left without a lap dance. Need I say more?",
        "The worst customer service experience. Unfortunately for them, my expectations for customer service are a bit higher seeing that this is a higher end Vegas spot...but damn. Just really upsetting.",
        "Who the heck even wants to climb this disgusting-looking mountain? It puts the beautiful Arizona nature and scenery to shame.",
        "This place is breath taking you have to go here if you go to Vegas.\\nThere is everything, shopping scenery, but don't forget your camera!!",
        "Went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed. Both of the bagels that were ordered were burnt to a crisp (see posted photo). We got the bagels to go, so we didn't notice until we got home.. Really disappointed",
        "Honestly don't know why everyone loves this place? The Yelpers below me must be drunk when they went here... Food sucks, prices are too high for quality of service and the people cooking the food look like convicts recently released from Tent City.",
        "The air conditioning in room 1602 didn't work, and the hotel refused to take responsibility. They simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before- we didn't get in until 2am- i would not stay here again. Ridiculous customer service.",
        "Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction.",
        "Food Streats across from the El Cortez was amazing...so many people, live DJ's, cool booths and great food trucks. \\n\\nI had the Fuku Karai spicy burger and it was really good! Soft, spicy and yummy!! I also enjoyed the thick  fries....",
        "Convenient spot to grab quick seafood before seeing Blue Man Group. Nice aquatic-themed d\\u00e9cor but not memorable compared to the mega restaurants at the Wynn and MGM. Of the seafood trio, the shrimp cocktail was good (your basic red sauce with extra horseradish fire), the lobster was bland, and the other fish, whatever the heck it was, was delicious.\\n\\n3-4 stars.",
        "This place sucks ASS!!! The food SUCKS and they only got me in the place through misleading advertising a happy hour that they lead you to believe is one thing, you order what you THINK is on HR and then...WAMOOOO!!! HUGE BILL the owner threatens to then call the police on you unless you pay up.......... PASS and save your money for Goldies or Zipps right up and down the street.",
        "Beautiful lit scenery using wire and colorful silk amazed us as we walked through the scenery.  Very impressive.   See my pictures!\\n\\nIf you are in Montreal, this is a must see ... check dates and times as it is a yearly temporary event.",
        "Very clean. Fair price for the quality food and ingredients. Simple menu. Good cheesesteaks and fries. Be aware of the cheese fries as they use real thick cheese :). It may be a little overwhelming. Overall, very good restaurant. We will return.",
        "Horrible horrible service!!!! What happened to this place?\\nFood is good and fresh. I refuse to go here during normal hours but if I'm craving sushi at 2am then I'd stop by. Otherwise I will drive way across town to Yama Sushi for excellent service and food! So sad to see this place fall apart..",
        "I went to Gus's once and haven't been back. There was loud electronic music playing the whole time, so it was really hard to talk. I had the sloppy joe, which was good, but overpriced seeing that no side came with it. Just a really weird experience."

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Had fried tofu, fried pork, peanut butter dumplings and eggplant. The fried foods were dry and tough. Pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in Montreal. Only try this if you're desperate for Chinese. (The pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood.)",
        "Authentic Chinese spicy food. when I say spicy, I mean it. The heat here is not for the faint of heart. Everything is very good. I would recommend bringing a Chinese friend to help navigate the menu.",
        "Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",
        "It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!",
        "I love going to Dutch brothers everybody there is so nice and genuinely seems to care about how you're doing the coffee is great my kids love the Junior MAFIA drink selection we go there about twice a week but this location is my favorite",
        "Awesome AYCE sushi. They have egg custard which is my favorite. The only down side is its a little brown. But, still delicious. The sushi offered includes nigari and combo rolls. The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",
        "These guys have the right attitude when it comes to product and service.  They are consistently top notch.  Their people are well trained and always very friendly.  Dutch Bros is easy to give a 5 star rating for their great coffee and even better service.",

        "Ok, it is Vegas and Summerlin, after all... so really should not expect authentic Korean food...that said, waitress brought wrong gochujang sauce for bibim bap...a Korean staple! When I initially asked for it, she had no clue! Enough said? Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "I love this place for dinner.  A very nice variety.  Service has always been good for me and the portions are huge.    I would tend to stay away from seafood here though.  I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",

        "La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",

Quick tip, 'would you like side salad' means extra salad on top of what is served with the food - it'd be cool if they made this a bit more clear!",
        "Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \\n\\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\\n\\nGet in here!!",
        "Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort.",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "I gave them 20% tips of my order, but they even forgot my order. I will never go back to have any meal in this restaurant. BTW, my friend told me that although this is a Chinese restaurant, this restaurant \\\"only\\\" open for American people. Because if you are Chinese people, they will not treat you as well as American people. How pathetic this restaurant is !!!",
        "i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast.",
        "Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri.",
        "Super speedy online ordering and they come to your house so quick! Can't beat that. Hey it's Chinese food, not rocket science. It gets the job done for those awesome cravings. I am not a frequent diner at Chinese food restaurants, but all I know is that this tastes great and is delivered fast for my lazy days. Can't beat that.",
        "A mom n pop kinda place.  Small, pho was good, shrimp roll was okay...but then againI grew up in Toronto, Canada where we have a huge Vietnamese population and pho places are everywhere, cheap and tasty!\\nSatisfied my pho craving while in Scottsdale.",
        "The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25",
        "Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there.",
        "I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \\\"b+\\\" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice.",
        "Food is alright. Had the mac and cheese and country green beans. The biscuits were good. Sis was insistent on trying it and since we were crunched on time we took it to-go. Took a while for the take out and prices are pretty high for the quality.",
        "Friends were staying here over EDC weekend... They had a fabulous suite that included two beds and couches and a niiiice bathroom! The beds were comfortable as HELL and the couch wasn't bad either! And when we ran out of towels, housekeeping brought us some more STAT. I'd love to unofficially stay here again sometime!",
        "Eric, owner of Tuning Gruppe is a VW/Audi enthusiast and truly cares about his customers and making sure they are happy.  Eric flashed my car with the GIAC DSG flash and the car has been running great!",
        "Stopped by Marquee for the Armin Van Buuren concert during EDC weekend and it was extremely nice. The stage area and dance floor is rather small but the light show and effects really make up for it if you can find your way out there. Overall I definitely much preferred Marquee over Tryst and Surrender.",
        "when I was in San Jose, I always know where to go for a great Vietnamese food.\\nfinally I found another place here when I'm travelling in Phoenix.\\nthis place is a local for people looking for a great vietnamese food.\\ncan't go wrong if you want an authentic vietnamese food.",
        "Fantastic vet.  Very caring staff and doctors.  Nice location.  Clean.  Highly recommend.",
        "ordered online...got there at time I requested and they said they just got order. The pizza was burnt and the rest a wet soggy mess..when I talked to kitchen manager I was informed that it is the fault of ordering a thin crust and vegatarian. Yes they gave me a credit...Only an apology when I mentioned I had not received one,,,only excuses.",
        "I am from Chicago,IL and I travel all over the states for my business, this is the worst Korean BBQ ever. The food was old and chewy and the service was very poor.They literally charged for lettuce they said it was extra, the side dishes were about five and when we asked for refill they were reluctant and not cooperative.Don't go to this place unless it is free.Big disappointment they also use gas instead of charcoal.",
        "WARNING !!!  this location is worse than any used car lot I ever visited.  Had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me.  Good therapists and good massage but HoRRiBLE business ethics,  DO NOT give them your credit card or checking info",
        "Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.",
        "The price was \\\"ok\\\" and a bit high but I have to say that their food portions were large. I got pho with everything in it and as a vietnamese person who eats pho regularly, this was not all that great. There was hardly meat, just mostly ramen and soup. The flavor wasn't entirely there, at least not what I am use to. Save your money and head over to Saigon for some good pho for the right price on Alma school.",
        "Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive).",
        "I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!",
        "The people who work at Dutch Bros are seriously the cutest, sweetest baristas, ever. Definitely a funky, party kind of vibe. Wonderful coffee, great service.",
        "The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan",
        "Very friendly staff. Food is cheap like any fast-food chinese restaraunt. The portions are huge for the lunch and dinner specials. The veggies are fresh just the right crunch. The food is better than the more expensive chinese restaraunts. Dissapointed with the egg rolls and the soups though. They can use some improvement but overall a quick and easy decision.",
        "Dont EVER go to the vietnameses guy name JOHN!!!! I went in for long layers and left with most of my hair cut off and it looks like a freaking Mullet!!! Wth.. Thats not long layers!!! He doesnt listen and I will never recommend this guy to even cut my dogs hair!!!",
        "We love Vietnamese restaurants, unfortunately this one just does not stack up against the average, maybe too much to expect in Vegas? Everything seems a little sub-par. Price is too much ($11 for extra large pho vs $8 average), you call that grilled beef? Seems like pork to me. That is pork chop? Seems like small pieces to me.",
        "Food is good but make sure to ask for easy sauce. All their dishes come with globs of sauce that is at the bottom of the bowl. There is no other rice bowl places is this area besides YC's. Gave 3 star because like YC's better and food comes with too much sauce. Will return but won't venture far into their menu besides ordering the teriyaki chicken bowl.",
        "Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!",
        "The food and service here was great...Belle was nice in making sure everything was more than satisfactory.  I really enjoyed this new Korean restaurant, and can't wait to get back.  I've already let several friends know to make their way over there.",
        "I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but this place is delicious. I've been here a few times and got a couple different sandwiches and one of their bowls and everything I've had was really good. I'll take their Big WAC over a Big Mac any day.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix.",
        "Today I was looking for a new phone.  Getting a new phone and plan is already a headache as there are so many hidden fees in plans. Claudia roman was my retail representative and she was extremely condescending and rude. Sprint already has terrible service, they don't have the luxury\\n to be ass holes, especially when you say your considering a new carrier.",
        "I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good.",
        "Jac's is the saving grace of Monroe Street. Delicious, reasonably-priced, traditional Americana food in a well-lit, clean, cozy space that can be described as bar-meets-restaurant. The drinks are fabulous, and the Bloody Mary could be a meal in itself with all of the add-ons. Attentive staff, great atmosphere. Will be back.",
        "Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.",
        "Yum. After doing some shopping at the Mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. Very clean, which is a big plus for a Vietnamese establishment. The food was great, very tasty. Would love to back.",
        "Beware of this place.  If you give them a credit card they will charge $25 on it no matter what even if you paid cash.  It happened to us a few nights ago.  We called the bar and they said it's their standard practice to charge this and then sometime later in the week to refund it.  Total BS we paid in cash there should be no charge on my card period.  We will never go back.",
        "If you want some quick, affordable, and tasty chinese take-out in Tempe than this place is reliable.  I've only been coming here for a short time now and never had any problems.  Just don't have any high expectations for something less than 6-7 dollars for a meal and you'll arrive home happy and full.",
        "I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. \\n\\nThey are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me.",
        "The worst Korean BBQ I have ever been, not too much choice u can really eat, also they serve some Chinese& Japanese food, wt the hell!!!!!! It's not a real Korean BBQ. Also let's talk abt the price I walked in by myself, order a ice tea to drink, total for me is $28!!!!",
        "Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!",
        "Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!",
        "Always delicious. As a Chinese person, and just moving to Pittsburgh, this place is a gem.  Well worth the 25min drive on a weekday",
        "Very expensive but very good Chinese food. The service is fast and friendly. The food is cooked immediately and is out in minutes. On a slow day, you can see the chefs watching you eat just to make sure they didnt screw it up. If you're willing to spend the extra dough, then go here. The lines can get long though, but they move people in and out rather quick.",
        "Pretty solid Korean food imo. Ordered the Gamjatang (meat was tender, broth was flavourful) and bibimbap (this also came with a soup which was nice!).\\n\\nWould recommend this place for a good Korean meal in Waterloo :)",
        "Yummy, quick lunch! This is our go-to local Chinese restaurant. It has been consistently good over the past 4-5 years we have been living here. We especially like their luncheon specials and to go dinners. We love their mu shu chicken/pork and their wonton soup.",
        "N9NE was the place to be 5 years ago, let alone 10. It felt like a shell of its former self tonight. Half full on a Friday night, the magic is gone. Prices have gone up over the years, don't mind paying for solid cuisine but $59 for fatty lamb chops, no thanks. Staff worked hard and meant well, but the sizzle is out of this steak.",
        "My third timing coming. I really want to work with them because there's not much Chinese in Phoenix and the staff is super nice; however, the sauce is horrible! More so, it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring, blabs way too sweet sauce. I will not be back.",
        "yummaaaaaaay....open till midnight! Chill outside on the patio at night, or during the day if its not 110 degrees. Fresh veggies, tasty blue cheese dip. Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient.",
        "This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person, and you can get much better from traditional Mexican diners at half the price. Service was not good, and the food was not good. I had Fajitas, and Applebee's produces a better product. Will not go back again, and in an area dominated by a lot of quality Mexican cuisine, this is a place to skip",
        "If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  \\n\\nAnother great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior.",
        "Dutch Bros is a place that I forget I love until someone surprises me with a drink from there. When I lived next door at Cholla, I took advantage of their free drinks when they first opened up. Hadn't been back in awhile, but a friend picked up an Almond Joy the other day and I fell in love all over again.",
        "Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.\\nMy Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.\\nFriendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.\\nExtra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!",
        "I love Luci's!!! Get their Hot Juan Black Bean Burger. It's the best I've ever had. Also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots. So good YUM!",
        "I came here a couple of times while on vacation catching a few suns games and have always left happy.service is good,food is good and atmosphere is great.actually got to meet thunder Dan and do shots with him wich was pretty unreal.its a sports bar so don't come here expecting anything more than bar type food",
        "Decent food, when in the mood for Chinese I go here. Sometimes I even have it delivered. Food is good and service is great.",
        "So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.\\n\\nWe would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \\\"intestine shaped like squirrel\\\", anyone?\\n\\nExcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment.",
        "OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!",
        "I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  \\n\\nThe fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  \\n\\nThey have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!\\n\\nEnjoy",
        "A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!",
        "I get the Chinese donuts. I don't know why they are so mind blowing but they are just amazing!!!!! I recommend trying them if you have a sweet tooth :)",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "Dr. Griffith is great. I've been to other vets who don't even care about animals. She is great with them. My large dog was feeling defensive and she knew how to make her feel comfortable and was patient during the whole visit. This will be the new place we take our dogs, and the fact that it's the cheapest in town is the cherry on top. Quick in and quick out too. No long waits. I'm happy!",
        "I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "Only 2 things bring me to McDonald's, the coffee and.cheap desert. I do give credit for McDonald's on how they operate like a machine. They get you in and out, but unfortunately not this one. 10 minutes for a cup of coffee? Only 4 tables in the place and every single table got up to complain about their food quality, missing food etc. Where's management? Obviously they didnt graduates from hamburger u.",
        "I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too.",
        "Food was standard Chinese fare. The wonton soup is very good and worth the upgrade.\\n\\nWhen I went, they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed. Had a long wait between wait staff visits. Place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush.",

        "The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!",
        "Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice",
        "Don't bother.  The Chinese spinach was very good, the duck and peppered steak were not so good.  I had the peppered steak removed from my bill because it was so tough.  The plum sauce for the duck was weird and instead of a nice little duck breast, they just threw in whatever body parts that suited them.  Heed  the warnings if those who have posted negative reviews. Again, don't bother.",
        "Tandy leather has all sorts of supplies and unique leather pieces for you to make your own bags, belts, anything leather. They also have iron stencils for burning into leather! Such a find!",
        "I love this place!  It's locally owned and I think it's a family.  They are from Korea, and the menu reflects some Korean specialities as well as terrific, freshly prepared, and beautifully presented sushi.  They have a good happy hour and reasonable non-HH prices.  Please patronize!",
        "The food is pretty good but we have gone in 3-4 times (because it is the only Chinese food in the area) and the service has been awful every time. \\nWe tried to call in an order and it still took them an extra 20 min then they said it would take to get our food. \\n\\nThis last time they only had one server working. I felt really bad for the guy."

        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",
        "I used to eat here all the time when it first opened up but got spoiled with all the great dining in my area, central Phoenix and quit making the trip to Scottsdale.

I notice that the dining area has become more formal than it used to be but the atmosphere and food are still fantastic.  Their peach bellini's are yummy and all the food super delicious!",

She is always friendly and motivating. I've learned so many great work outs that I can easily replicate at home. The prices are reasonable as well.",
        "It's a sandwich shop modeled on Subway, better than Subway, but it's still just a sandwich shop with deli-meat laden subs, wraps, fold em's and salads; no sides except chips; and cheap combo prices.  Filling and a good value, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe donut shop thingie encroaching on the dining area is just a bit odd.  Expensive little donuts.  How cool.",

There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",

The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",

I have to places that don't have these small but thoughtful items! \\n\\nIf I had to post anything potentially negative, it would be that they do not have  a stand up bed.",

Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.",
        "Always delicious. As a Chinese person, and just moving to Pittsburgh, this place is a gem.  Well worth the 25min drive on a weekday",
        "Maybe because it's a Sunday or a brand new menu but service was extremely slow!  Server was a nice lady. However there were literally 3 other customers in the bar.   Food is average. Your typical bar food.  Very selected ( burger, grilled ham and cheese) however beer is cheap and cold!!!! Just order 2 at time cause it may take a while to get that second drink!",
        "This place is awesome, plus the dance floor is spacious and music is great! Local night is on Sunday, but get in line early because the line will be 1 hour or more... My suggestion is to find promoter and get on guest list, which will make your life easier!",
        "We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.

        "Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one. I've never seen food service staff move so quickly as when you walk in here at 20 mins. till closing time. They want you to inhale your food and get out. The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)",
        "Great location and interior. Food is noting to write home about , and service is poor.\\nThey tout the the Chinatown experience but it's about 2x the china town price . Don't go here if you want the Vegas food and service experience because it will disappoint and leave your pocket book empty for not.",
        "Decent. Nothing to write home about good place for an appetizer and beer. However the main menu has an identity crisis (bar and grill is not fried rice or egg rolls maybe dumplings not so much). Sometimes small bar drama does not need to be shared with all.",
        "I would go back.\\n\\nReminds me of a mom n pop stop.  People were friendly, service was pretty good.  The food wasn't anything to write home about but I did enjoy my meal.  I liked the casual setting and it's in a convenient complex with plenty of parking.",
        "Bennys is like a old girlfriend, we've been through the best and the worst together. To start the best is food how the menu is so far and beyond anything around. But I have had hit or miss occasions and I've heard horror stories and glory stories so until consistency pervales  good luck",
        "Yelp and Good Fellas  really came through for my family and I while we were off the beaten path looking for some good grub.  Good Fellas is very very good food.  They have a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is just about the food.  Try the two meat combo.  MMMMMM!  The lentil soup is excellant (try it with some lemon juice).  The only thing I did not like about the place is it is not in the east valley!",
        "the portions are generous and the staff is friendly and helpful. but the food is just ok. nothing to write home about. i was really interested in going here for quite sometime, maybe that had something to do with why I thought the food was so bland. I had it built up in my head to be better than it was.",
        "brunch only until 1PM on sunday and noon on Saturday?  is it just my spoiled Chicago self, or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch?",
        "There's not much to be said about the pizza here except that it is comparatively cheap, quick, and is no frills. Whether you're tired of overpaying for things on the strip or want to get late night grub without a reservation, this is your place. Free water and condiments, and you get to tease everyone at the Cosmopolitan with your cheap yet filling pizza. Can't go wrong.",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time.",
        "Been here 3 times. I must admit it is not so great and over priced. The service lacks but they are open late. On a sunday night when I rip off a nail before a big dinner meeting, they are open for a quick fix. I give them props for the crazy late hours but there would be no reason to visit them otherwise.  Last resorts and emergencies only.",
        "Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison.",

I used to come here more frequently, but I find that sometimes they're out of premium unleaded, but I don't know until I pull up to the pump and see a little note on the pump.  That irritates me.  However, when I need gas and I'm in the area, I have no choice.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 50%",

        "Echo coffee spent way more money on their decor than they did their coffee beans. I stopped in one afternoon for a snack and afternoon java jolt. The espresso coffee was on par with illy, the brownie was clearly from a duncan hines box. I can pretty much get both of those at home. Bottom line: Why go here when Orange Table is around the corner and makes homemade goodies?",
        "Brunch for two on a Sunday...\\n\\nAll on the positive...great atmosphere, service was prompt and polite, pressed coffee was good, the breakfast was above average...Chelsea's hotcakes & bacon, the Chilaquiles were outstanding!   \\n\\nWe will be back when in the Phx area.  :)",
        "It is alright. My buffalo chicken pizza was tangy but not spicy, but still pretty good. The beer selection is pretty great. The service was pretty terrible but the manager came out and apologized for the shabby service and comped my pizza so kudo's for that. I felt the atmosphere was cold and uncomfortable and the design was definitely done by some company who shouldn't be designing restaurants. Ill go back and give it another shot before i write this one off.",

BUT at  $20 for a personal pizza it\\\"s a rip off. The staff however are very nice and the service is good but again not worth the price at all. Also the decor is borderline ghetto Oh yeah and no credit cards. So bring cash for this pit.",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait.",

        "This is a pretty big buffet but it's pretty gross. It's reminds me of the old school Vegas buffets, before they got fancy. It's a big long line of trays which makes jumping to and from items pretty difficult. Expect nasty little kids running all over and fatties trying to jump in front of you for the last piece of fried chicken. The ONLY reason to get this buffet is if it's free.",
        "Warning!!! Watch your bank account after transactions. We through the drive thru at approx 350am. Ordered a breakfast burrito and the night shift guy over weight build wearing black rimmed glasses gave himself a $10 tip. Service was slow and he stated he was on the phone with the police. Best conversation I heard with the police. Beware!",
        "The food was lacking flavor and taste, we were there for the ACF Convention. The service was lacking and non existing bussers.",
        "I really like this place and my wife doesn't.  Mediterranean Pizza.  Good prices. Light on the toppings though.  Which may be good for some.  Fresh ingredients, lots of selection and  brick oven baked.   They get a little lower mark from me because it is a bit small and atmosphere could be a lot nicer if they were larger.  They are sort of part casual dining part fast food diner.  3 of 5 stars for a casual dining experience.",

There are certain items like the chocolate peanut butter which  can really cause addiction, while there are others like the key lime, and red velvet which taste like any other key lime or red velvet cupcake.

That is unless you are already addicted to a certain flavor.",

I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you.",

Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",

My honey got the omlette it was good the hash browns are a little more well done than would have liked but still tasty. The staff was friendly and attentive Iwill definaty be back for more :)",

Now however I feel the place is a great addition to the Old Town mix. Great bartenders good diverse crowd from 21 to 80 . This is what a real pub should be like. If you don't like the pasty choices try the pasta salad with chicken. So happy to see no TVs .",

        "Two words: KIDS SUITE!\\n\\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!",
        "Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment.",
        "Sure - it looks like its better days are behind it.  But the work is great!\\n\\nThey care a lot and spend quite a bit of time getting it right.  I am quite particular.  \\n\\nEverything gets wiped down.  It's the third time I've been here. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back.",

        "The rocking chairs are genius!\\n\\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\\n\\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \\n\\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \\n\\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20.",
        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",

I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\\n\\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.",
        "Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price.",

        "Excellent service; GREAT food. \\nThe staff is really nice and accommodating. We eat at Bunky's frequently and I just hosted a baby shower there.  They did a great job of accommodating my budget and making my friend feel very special.  I highly recommend them for catering as well.",

There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",

        "Tastes like home made! Better in some cases.. \\nThe tortillas tasted absolutely amazing, the carne asada was great. You gotta try the breakfast burritos. Customer service was great, our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas.",

        "Great spot to find a wide variety of records, and most other things music related! They also have guitars and amps, and everything is priced fairly. The owner is friendly and always helpful to answer any questions you may have. I mostly enjoy that they have records old and new. You're bound to find entertainment when you walk through the door!",

        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",

        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "For $35/person but no olysters or sahimi?  No way!  It's just not worth it.  I dont understand why it's rated four stars.  If you put aside the dessert, it's a $15 buffet top.   For same price, I'd rather go to Todai at Planet Hollywood.",
        "A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. \\n\\nThere are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.",
        "I am from Chicago,IL and I travel all over the states for my business, this is the worst Korean BBQ ever. The food was old and chewy and the service was very poor.They literally charged for lettuce they said it was extra, the side dishes were about five and when we asked for refill they were reluctant and not cooperative.Don't go to this place unless it is free.Big disappointment they also use gas instead of charcoal.",
        "Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!",
        "Have been for late dinner, and happy hour appetizers.  Both good, but only good.  Which is good!!  Italian is top quality for Las Vegas, but with a club inside the restaurant it becomes tough to take serious as a top quality restaurant.  The appetizers are great, cocktails are decent. If you want Vegas flare, it is one of the top places that cater to people who need both liquid and solid.  Definitely worthy!",
        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible.  \\n\\nThe girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",

        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "It was about a 2 1/2 hour class for the adult/child/infant CPR/AED certification. John did an excellent job teaching the class. It was very informative. It was only $40. I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much.",

        "They took over the old Donut Queen location.  The lamb burgers are the best.  Very good vegetarian selection.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "This buffet did not live up to my expectations.  If it's a pricey Vegas buffet, I expected way more than what Wynn offered. \\n\\nCame here on a Sunday night and there was no line.  \\n\\nThe food selection was alright, or perhaps I was in a rush to make my way through everything.\\n\\ni did not discover anything that I wanted to go back for a second serving.",

I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "This place is horrible! \\n\\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?",
        "Oh No!!!! \\nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy.

        "I never thought much of this place but tried it again recently and it was alright.  Nice that they have Old Meck on tap, the beer is bitchin.  I had their chili cheese fries and they were a fail.  It was like that liquid cheese like the jar stuff by frito lay.  The chili was like real chili and made the fries slimey and wet.  I had wings as the main course and they were good, no complaints with them.",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",

The service was exceptional. \\n\\nWould definitely dine again.",

We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",

The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min.

        "Small quaint little airport. Pretty nice not the fanciest. You can gamble if you like there. Luggage is weird. You have to take a train to another area to get your luggage. Shuttle to the strip is easy and cheap, 7 dollars one way. Better then driving and cheaper and more relaxing.",
        "Did not like this place at all. It was small and very empty. Now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening, but we left and went right to the mirage's other club, and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun (5 minutes after this place).  So, not sure what the story was on that.",
        "Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.",
        "Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!",
        "Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.",
        "Man I LOVE this place! I really hope they do well! You will not find better Mexican food and a more laid back relaxed atmosphere!!! They only thing they need to do is put sand on the floor! Great beer and booze selections! I will be back again and again.",
        "When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \\\"certified technicians\\\" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else.",
        "Went again, this time for dinner.  I still say it's not worth it for the price, even more so now after I've been to the Studio B buffet. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-b-buffet-henderson)\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving it another star is because that creme brulee is out of this world. And maybe I didn't hate their meat as much this time.",
        "Before I finally tried this place, a couple people told me this was the best noodles in Vegas. I has the T. Shoyu noodles & Takana fried rice. Both were filling & okay, but I thought pho was more satisfying. Don't think I'll be back. I tried seeing if they had siracha hot sauce, but the server ignored me. These are only my opinions, perhaps many others think Monta is one of the best as well.",
        "Do not purchase video games here! Used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new.",
        "It's packed like PURE is and you're really just constantly moving around. Pretty hard getting drinks. \\n\\nMy cousin was doing the robot (haha) and then taking a picture with these dudes...and then the next second, he's ready to fight them for whatever reason. Good times. I told him I wasn't ready for a 6 v. 2 battle, but maybe after two more $15 shots of Patron I would be.",
        "I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!",
        "I dropped into this gym while traveling for work. The staff was amazingly inviting and friendly.  The facilities were spacious and new.  The workout was rewardingly tough.  I can't say enough good things about this gym.  If you are contemplating joining a cross-fit gym, I highly recommend.",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .",
        "Just watched the chef drop his tongs on the ground, pick them up and use them again. Refund? Yes please.  Not returning to this place. When I asked him about it he wouldn't respond to me.",
        "Calm down, people. \\n\\nIt's pricey and pretty average. Go somewhere else if you can, but go if you have to, because it'll hit the spot if you want it enough.  #Firstworldproblems",
        "The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.",
        "Two words: KIDS SUITE!\\n\\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "I had a huge burger and it was ok. I would have liked a little less quantity and more quality. Not a place I would return to. I ate about 1/3 my meal and was disappointed. The tractor is cool.",
        "ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..",
        "More interested in money than your teeth,. Always pushing unneeded cosmetic procedures ( I'm 50, i dont need braces!).  Horrible customer service.  Billing practices are irregular, confusing  and they are unable to explain why we paid so much more than the estimate. They never returned any of my calls for explanation.  we are getting a new dentist!",
        "They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.",
        "I had the lunch special Mini-Pizza while traveling through Tempe.  It was too salty.  Not pleasant.  The ambiance was very noisy.  The service was slow.  I would not go back.",
        "Portions are less and the prices are substantially more. :( \\n\\nLove the food and the atmosphere but with the rising costs, my visits become less frequent.",
        "I'm on the fence on whether I like Aria or Cosmo better, but I know for sure that I like playing poker in Aria, so it is all the more convenient to stay there.",
        "I was introduced to Mitchell's by a friend of mine and have been a big fan ever since! \\n\\nThe staff is always very welcoming and everyone at the bar always look like they're having a great time.\\n\\nTheir garlic parmesan wings are usually a go to for myself and friends, along with a Titos vodka of course. I look forward to many more happy hours to come!",
        "This place is sweet. Complimentary valet, non smoking, need I say more?\\n\\nThe breakfast is and guest services is amazing, me an my new fiance have no complaints.\\nThe rates are great even during BIG weekends.\\n\\nWill return!",
        "One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. NEVER a bad meal here. I was in Vegas in April and we dined here as usual and then again last week. We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times. It's just that good!!",
        "Good spot on Mill to try a wide variety of beers.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable of the beers, which is important in a place like this.\\n\\nIt is a bit loud but they do have an upstairs area that I would recommend if you're with friends and want to have a conversation.",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",
        "Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "Small but decent downtown farmers market- a major pluses are that this one is indoors AND parking is free and easy to find on-site.\\n\\nThree different product booths were present, along with two food trucks (Rika Arepa Express and 50 Shades of Green), a coffee shop, live music, and a handful of artisans selling jewelry and kitchen supplies.\\n\\nInterested to see whether this market garners more participants in the fall.",
        "Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "I usually stay at the Monte Carlo. I like the location and it's easy to find your way around.  I'm not giving up on the Monte Carlo just yet but they have some issues with maintenance and housekeeping.  The carpets are dirty and the bathroom has issues that would make Bob Vila crap his pants. That said, none of these issues were bad enough to repack my clothes and ask for another room. It's Vegas who stays in their room for a long",
        "The food was good a bit overpriced but whatever. The problem was the service the lady working at the register was unfriendly and unresponsive. I had ordered the green salad instead of the Mac salad but instead she gave me the Mac salad. I told her it was wrong and rudely she said it would be 50\\u00a2 more. Waited 20 minutes then just left. The lady that works there is brain dead.",
        "Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "This place has gotten much more appealing since they first opened!  The staff seems much more broken in, and I think they may have adjusted their drink prices some.  Either way, the atmosphere here is great on the weekends.  The patio is big and has a bar but the shape of it makes it just a little awkward when its busy.",
        "still sucks! Enough said.",
        "I brought my car to Clean Freak today. When I got out, the car looked like it was never washed.  Although I paid for the 5.00 wash, I expected my car to be a least clean when it came out. The wash did not even remove a leaf that was on my car! I went to the car wash at 59th and Bell. Will never go again!",
        "Good place to grab breakie in Scottsdale. I had the traditional Benedict and it was quite tasty. Service was fast and friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all. We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast.",
        "Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly.",
        "It works, don't expect more or less than food court food from your local shopping mall.",
        "Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.",
        "Well I can't really say anything seeing as I wasn't able to get in. I know they do not take reservations and it is walk in only. I tried calling to see what the wait time would be and nobody answered the phone. I was transferred to hotel concierge who wasn't able to get ahold of anyone either. So far not a good impression. I'll try again another time",
        "Friends were staying here over EDC weekend... They had a fabulous suite that included two beds and couches and a niiiice bathroom! The beds were comfortable as HELL and the couch wasn't bad either! And when we ran out of towels, housekeeping brought us some more STAT. I'd love to unofficially stay here again sometime!",
        "Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  \\n\\nAnd definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.\\n\\nI'll be back again!!",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
        "Located within treasure island. It's an odd combo a pho shop and coffee shop. I only ordered a Cobb salad $15 and service seemed good, unlike other reviews.  The salad was decent and serving size was large. We spilt the salad between two people  and it was enough food.  I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them.",
        "Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Good food and a surprisingly intimate venue at the quiet end of the strip. Well worth giving a try, kind of a little gem. I had the duck which was okay, the breast could have been more tender but the presentation was good and the taste was balanced.",
        "I went here with a Meet-up group and had a great experience. The food, service and atmosphere was terrific! We all enjoyed ourselves and will return.",
        "I called Chris to repair dog damage to my carpets based solely off the reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed.  He was every bit as professional and capable as the previous reviews stated.  He made sure to call when he was on his way and showed up when he said he would and was much more reasonably priced than other services I had called.  He took his time and did a phenomenal job with 2 repairs in my home. I would call him again in a second."

        "High pressure sales tactics and an average product. It was funny to listen to the guy tell me how much better their solution was that my current one and then try to justify why it was going to cost almost twice as much for approximately 1/2 the channels. I think I will stick with DISH.... however, I would use them over COX.",
        "Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there.",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",

        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.",
        "My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!",
        "The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.",
        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible.  \\n\\nThe girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",
        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "WARNING !!!  this location is worse than any used car lot I ever visited.  Had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me.  Good therapists and good massage but HoRRiBLE business ethics,  DO NOT give them your credit card or checking info",
        "If you are serious about looking like a pimp, this is absolutely your destination.  There are a mix of consignment items and new pimp-gear.  I drooled over the three ties painted with Vargas girls ($100 each).  Oddly, almost everything I looked at was priced at $85.  The woman working there did not get off the phone or offer to help me the entire time I was there.",
        "I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",
        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Pi\\u00f1a Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.",
        "It was about a 2 1/2 hour class for the adult/child/infant CPR/AED certification. John did an excellent job teaching the class. It was very informative. It was only $40. I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much.",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",

        "Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive).",
        "Amazing one of a kind furniture!  I have purchased several items for my new home and love everything I chose.  Everything is hand painted and has a special touch.  Owners are very nice and have a delivery service available to assist you if you don't own a truck.  Check it out!!",
        "Reallllly good sandwiches,  i love this place, just had a bad encounter with the owner one time though. Ive seen the guy on several occassions and he is nice,but this one time he basically borderline disrespected me....ugh I hate that because it has left with me with  a foul taste in my mouth for the place. HOWEVER --- I can't resist. I love this freaking place...",
        "Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?",
        "The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table.  I do have to say that i didnt like the food.  I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste/look like.\\n\\nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them.",
        "not worth going to. go to the south rim its better because u can take pictures there as well as free shuttle buses and a theatre. you have to pay to get in on the west rim as well as not bringing no phones no camera. what is the use of paying $74 a person to go on the skywalk and then not using your camera to take photos that is a rip off. everyone comes miles and miles away to come here to take photos.",
        "Their employees have such bad customer service. I stop going there. I drive to target now",
        "Tried to eat lunch here today.  Was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up.  Waited for a half hour with no service.  Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training.",
        "There is nothing Grand Canyon-esque about the Grand Canyon Experience except the fake rock facade and the real birds that have taken up residence inside (I saw three).  This is a large tourist trap, I mean souvenir shop.  They have every kind of trinket including crystals, \\\"Indian\\\" jewelry, and myriad Las Vegas T-shirts.  There are two floors packed with stuff you don't need.",
        "Sooo Sad that this location has been closed. Now we have to drive to the one located in central phoenix.",
        "Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.",
        "Once I loved this restaurant ,\\nThis is third time we order vegetarian and they had chicken in it..",
        "Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.",
        "I have to say I found Grinders on yelp and I tried it because of the great reviews and all I have to say is they were right:-). The food was awesome the staff was so friendly I felt like I was a regular the way they all conversed with me I will be back I got a pizza and the cheeseburger sub incredible my friends loved it too.  Thx you grinders see u soon.  Steve from Southwest Airlines",
        "I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!",
        "Great for serious BBQ cookers. No better place to get supplies. If they don't have it that can usually get it.  Bring you truck because you will want to buy it all.  $18.00 for a 2 cubic foot bag of 1/2 cut logs I bought almond, peach and hickory today.  There is no other place to stock up on BBQ product in Vegas.",
        "Love this place. I drive all the way from Cave Creek just so my puppy can eat all natural. Thanks for not having sugar in your treats. Good puppy heres some sugar. Not anymore Thanks again. Dakotas fav's Stella & Chewy's duck treats.",
        "Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!",
        "Expensive. Ok I don't know a real brat if it fell and hit me on the head, but $15 for three brats, some sauerkraut and mash? Great atmosphere, beer looked awesome but I'm not spending $30 with tip for a beer and German hot dogs.",
        "First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35",
        "a \\\"third-wave\\\" spot that earns this designation not only by looks and ambiance, but the excellent coffee served as well. lever machines and baristas who pull consistently good shots every time i'm there. also a great place to buy whole beans. a great place to read/study as well, with wholesome snacks/food when you get hungry!",
        "Nope-not authentic, pre-prepared, the chips are way too greasy and flavorless, and every entree tastes the same as every other entree. I went there with a party of five.l tasted everyone's entree. Tasted like we were all eating the same thing.\\nI have not had authentic Mexican anywhere in Madison. I'm told by my friend from Mexico, that yellow cheese is not used in Mexican food, nor are black olives.",
        "A student-friendly take on the whole style bar thing that would have looked and felt quite modern and interesting about 8 years ago, but now just feels lazy.\\n\\nJust like the slovenly, disinterested staff, whom oddly enough I actually warmed to due to their sheer indifference. Having worked behind bars myself, and felt exactly like them doing it, a trip to Koko invariably ends up feeling like a trip down memory lane.",
        "Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.",
        "Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again",
        "Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",
        "Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.",
        "I like to stop in here now and again since its so close to home. Good service and a really fun selection of gelato. Shares the building with coffee shop Hava Java next door. Nice private outdoor, shaded, seating as well. Good overall, but three stars for an previous issue with some spoiled gelato.",
        "Visited EQ3 for some decor ideas. It was OK, very contemporary (which doesn't happen to be my style), but overall nothing spectacular about this place. They had some items priced reasonably, but lots that I felt were overpriced for what they were. I would keep this place in mind, but look elsewhere first.",
        "Great place to stop by and check out. My husband and I come here for produce and pine straw. Staff is always friendly. They usually have a large variety of produce. During Apple season I think they had about 15 different types to choose from.  \\n\\nHillybilly is Located at Margaret Wallace and Independence Blvd. This location can be difficult to get out of on Saturday and during rush hour because the right lane turns into a turning lane for Village Lake Drive.",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",

        "Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated",
        "Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria.",
        "I was very disappointed base on all the good reviews. The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min. Service was very slow and had to ask multiple times for bread and water. Hate to say this but Outback is MUCH better. Will probably never return or recommend to friends",
        "Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \\\"delicious\\\" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!",
        "2 stars for frozen hot chocolate... yummm\\nWaiting time to be seated 30 mins\\nWater to be delivered at your table 15 mins\\nAnother 15 mins wait to take your orders\\n41 minutes wait for the food :( \\nFood was so-so, not bad, not that good either.\\n\\nI only want the frozen hot choco, so I'll just order at the window next time.",
        "I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location",
        "Very efficient and a good value.  I booked online just prior to flight departure.  Good directions to get to the shuttle, very short wait and in the hotel in less than 30 min from  landing (no bags).  On departure they were actually a few minutes early for pickup but sent a text telling me they were waiting.  Would definitely use Super Shuttle again.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "The Linq is a \\\"mini strip\\\" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",
        "this place has teenagers running the place! Customer service is horrible! You are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",
        "Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!",
        "Simply AMAZING in details and taste! A must for the love of food.",
        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.",
        "Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.",
        "Unlike the previous review, I've ate here. 4-5 times, and each time I've had EXCELLENT food and service. Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place.",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "I like Big Buddha for its fresh taste, price, portions, and speed. I love it when I call in an order and when I get there (only 5 mins away) its almost always done I rarely have to wait for anything. I'm not real big on there fried rice seems like its just like the white rice with some Soy sause mixed into it... But over all a go place to go.",
        "Salsa verde, cilantro, pork crackling. You can't ask for anything better. Surprisingly dioecious authentic Mexican food. Excellent drink and food selection. Having grown up on Mexican food, this is certainly up to standard. Good ambiance, too.",
        "28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word \\\"Express\\\" from your signage.",
        "I have two free meals here and can't seem to bring myself to going. \\n\\nAnyone want to try it risk free? Pm me and I will arrange the details.",
        "Horrible service! Do not come here ever. One time I came to the store 15 mins before their closing time and they didn't let me in. Another day I came 40 mins before they closed and they were rushing me to the cashier the whole time. Super rude! Also, one day I asked for the price of an item and she said \\\"I don't know\\\" and walked away.",
        "There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible.",
        "Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "I am sorry but this show was just plain BOOORING, the big fat stupid baby is just lame, the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny. \\nDont think im not a Cirque fan because I am, I loved KA and Zumanity, but Mystere is just overated, skip it.\\nVery blah.",

        "Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.",
        "Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago.",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",
        "I could go on and on about how great everything is at the McCormick Ranch Golf Club.  My daughter just got married there and it was amazing.  The day prior they had a LARGE group of guys from near and far and they had an amazing time golfing!  We had my daughters wedding and reception and it was so beautiful!  Kristina is the bomb!!!  The is a true gem!  It was all just perfect!    \\n\\nJacque Ast\\nMother of the Bride",
        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.",
        "Was super impressed with the fish tacos. Same taste and fell as cali. Also the 3 rolled tacos were amazing as well. Service was good, friendly staff and love option of having beer. Didn't like the bar being separated from dinner room. All in all great food, and great healthy choices.",
        "Horrible customer service. I have to wait 40 min. To return a charger that doesn't work.",
        "I come here about once a year and then I remember why I don't come here more often. My car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me. And now I wait. Will prob take 40 mins to get out of here .",
        "Rookie place. If you don't care about decor go to US Egg around the corner. Better service, food and coffee. Bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress.",
        "Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.",
        "Our first time here! Very relaxing and service was excellent! James and the manager took care of us! We enjoyed the food.",
        "Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Thanks dude with the glasses. You were tacking in charges without explaining anything. Oh and usps does give you a tracking number bro. 70 cents. Thanks a lot for not offering all of your services. I would've left zero stars if I could have. The dude at the cash register was so rude and uninformative.",

        "Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.",
        "So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! \\n\\nI loved the show! The performers are amazing!! & it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!",
        "After waiting on the phone as \\\"caller number one\\\" for almost 10 mins, I decided to drive in while still on hold...After getting parked and in line the casket FINALLY picked up my call. I ordered my food only to get home and it was WRONG. Avoid this location at all cost, I can't believe they screwed up my meal after all that.",
        "This place is entertaining as hell.  It was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once, and the beer selection was massive.  Unfortunately I got so sick from the food that I had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss Cirque du Soliel.",
        "I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.",
        "Very yummy! It's really fun to try all the different flavors here, and it's a cool place to take friends or out of town guests. Everything is so unique, and it's so cool that all the items are made in the store. The staff is also friendly and knowledgeable.\\n\\nJust thinking about this place is making me hungry!",
        "We were going to a Cirque du Soleil show and came across BLT Burger. The service was a bit slow, but the burger and milkshake were great! I had a Tex Mex burger with a vanilla/Oreo milkshake. Highly recommend both! I would definitely go back!",
        "Braydon and the rest of the team at Pinnacle Capital Mortgage in the Scottsdale Branch does a great job at understanding your needs and helping you to qualify for the program that best fits your needs. I would highly recommend Braydon if you need a loan for a new home purchase, a refinance, and also renovation.",
        "RESTAURANT INFLEXIBLE. Reserved table for wine pairing dinner months in advance with the understanding that one of the party didn't eat meat. \\nTwo days before the dinner we were sent a menu which contained no options other than meat. The chef refused to alter her menu to add a non-meat option. \\nChef too self-important to accommodate clientele.",
        "Waited 10 min at airport for shuttle to arrive.  Waited 15 min to load the bus in a leisurely and surly fashion.  Waited 10 min after bus was full, not sure why.  What would have been an 8 min taxi  ride took over an hour with all the stops.  And we only saved $5 for the two of us compared to a taxi.  Just say no to Slowtime.",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "The ambiance was the only thing I didn't love about this place but even that was fine. The food was interesting/unique and the service was exceptional. James our server took our experience to the next level. This place was worth all of the recommendations we got from friends",
        "Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",
        "I really discount tire for their prices and warranties, but one thing I can't stand is how they scraped my lip on my new wheels when they installed the new tire. Of course they denied it...what to do, ugh.",
        "Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one. I've never seen food service staff move so quickly as when you walk in here at 20 mins. till closing time. They want you to inhale your food and get out. The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)",
        "Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.",
        "Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs.",
        "If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  \\n\\nAnother great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior.",
        "I ordered a chophouse burger for dinner this evening along with the bottomless root beer float. We hadn't been to Red Robin in quite sometime mainly owing to having outrageously busy work schedules. The burger was excellent but I drank too many floats before it arrived. It was nice to receive a red royalty discount of 10% off the bill.\\n(4/7/13)",
        "Save your money.  I grew up with Michael Jackson's music and this show was awful! It was so boring and kiddish we walked out after 20 min's!  And, the seats where not high enough to look over the person in front of you.",
        "THE best show I've ever seen.  Great for all ages, and worth EVERY expensive penny.  Its eye-popping eye-catching eye-candy.  And if you've never been to a Cirque show, its not all about clowns.  The show is a visual masterpiece.  Go go go!",
        "Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better.",
        "OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!",
        "Gross buffet don't be fooled by that price you get what you paid for and I didn't pay for it.  I walked over to Quiznos and let my friends try this place out.  It's Vegas there are plenty of better buffets around, do yourself a favor and go there.",
        "If you go here, you will enjoy a four course fondue meal. The desert chocolate is awesome. I prefer the 'Smores' option but the others look great also. They have many options for the main course. This place is pricey and you do have to cook your own food, but a nice option for special occasions.",
        "Expensive.  Problem with this place is that a guy with SUPER greasy hands took my keys and my got in my car.... yup, you guessed it, grease all over my door handle, shifter, steering wheel, car keys... just disgusting.  Will NEVER go back...!",
        "Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.",

        "Bad service. Got both of my coffee orders wrong and my food order. Lady was rude on the intercom and they took 20 min. This is just another reason why Starbucks does so well.. Always great customer service and your order is always right. Maybe this place should learn a few things from them!!!!",
        "If you don't have a reservation don't show up. They tell ya 45 mins and it turns into 2 hours. Not worth the wait when hunger.",
        "By far my favorite show in Vegas so far. I really enjoyed my experience at the show. Well worth the money spent. I strongly encourage you go see this show! I've seen KA and Love, which are the two most popular cirque shows in Vegas and I can honestly say I enjoyed KA much more than Love. The acrobatics are phenomenal. A definite must see while you're in Vegas. You will not be disappointed.",
        "Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process. When their original diagnosis was wrong they went to option b and didn't charge me for the unneeded replacement. They usually very busy, but we'll worth any wait.",
        "The food is pretty good but we have gone in 3-4 times (because it is the only Chinese food in the area) and the service has been awful every time. \\nWe tried to call in an order and it still took them an extra 20 min then they said it would take to get our food. \\n\\nThis last time they only had one server working. I felt really bad for the guy.",
        "I'm not usually one to leave negative reviews and usually give the benefit of the doubt when I have one bad experience, but our family came here and finally left after waiting forever and never getting served. Too bad, because I LOVE places like this and have heard great things.",
        "Love the music here, a mix of 70's, 80's and 90's. The burgers are grass fed all beef and are very delicious and if you're in the mood for comfort then get some wings they are bigger than Buffalo Wild Wings and they have a good selection of sauces to go with and even have an all you can eat wing option and all you can eat salad bar. We will be back and nice touch with the throwback arcade games.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "Headed back to Phoenix and of course I get stuck with jerk Bernard again. Swerving all over he road, being rude to customers.  We stopped in Falstaff for what he's said was a 15 min break.....he left us on the bus for 43 mins without explanation.  Then when is asked him what t he problem was he said,nothing and was extremely rude",
        "Warning!!! Watch your bank account after transactions. We through the drive thru at approx 350am.

Best conversation I heard with the police. Beware!",
        "What can I say? I love lazy rivers. Even though  there is probably a huge percentage of alcohol and pee, it's still fun. It's like adults on a hamster wheel drunk. If you get sick of the hamster wheel try the nachos, they are huge and the yummiest pool side snack they offer.",
        "Top service for my slowly leaking tyre in my hire car. Quick and efficient, and CHEAP. No bullshit either. They patched the tyre and all is well. I thought it might have taken a while and went across the road to the Del Tacos to get some lunch (we were starving) and by the time we got back 30 mins later it was all fixed and ready to go. If you need tyres and you're in Vegas, go here.",
        "A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  \\n\\nLast time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood.",
        "Expensive? Yes. But everything that's good in vegas is. Good spot off the strip, nice ambiance, great menu selection. Great craft cocktails. Steaks were excellent, as promised. The seafood options tasted very fresh, and presentation was overall great. If you are at the palms and want \\\"good\\\" food. This is your best option",
        "Decent subs, but the ordering system is annoying and the staff is really clueless. This place needs a grown up in the worse way.\\n Some thoughts: quit hiding the napkins behind the counter. Label the subs for take out. Put subs in a bag. Take customers name upon order to avoid confusion. Open the line on the left side of the restaurant first instead of bottlenecking customers into the restroom hall. Finally, TURN DOWN THE MUSIC A NOTCH!",

        "After 30 mins of waiting for two open seats I finally got one.  We sat right in the middle in the second row of tables.  The first few acts were alright, I wouldn't quite describe it as incredibly ground breaking, but there are some interesting displays of light and precision choreography.  Other than that, there's not much you can do with a bunch of similarly-shaped women and sub-par acting."

My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",

The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",

The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.",
        "Love the food, but am VERY disappointed that I was charged 1.50 for a refill, when every other time I have been to Which Wich, it was only .50  I don't understand how they can get away with charging different prices.  It seems to me that the price should be the same nationwide...and I have been to several different locations nationwide...all only charged .50 !  This will definitely affect my decision about how often to come here.",

I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them.",

The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",

        "Interior can certainly be modernized, however the food is solid. I'm not a fan of paying to sub hash browns and a english muffin for fruit. Seeing as how I am now paying more for less food.

Why would anyone want to eat here?",

The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",

The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup.",

We will never go back.",

I really wish I hadn't insisted on coming here and paying more for less. The crab legs were the only thing I had that was good but you can't really mess that up. Next time I'm in town I'll pass on the buffet scene.",

T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",

The food was ok ( baked potato was cold) I feel the dining room is poorly managed as most of the tables needed bussing which required us to wait 20 min.

Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",

For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",

If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",

It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \\\"homemade\\\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.",
        "love it here! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site. Its a pretty big place, there are always seats inside and out, which is really nice.

My husband had a waffle with frozen yogurt and I had the very berry crepes. Not expensive but not a cheap meal, either.  Good to people watch, great for somethin different in the Vegas experience which did not include the word 'buffet'.",

Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.",

Definitely worth checking out!",

Once we got in, the place was smaller than I expected and there was one dj on the stage. There were lots of asians and indians at this club. The dance floor was so crowded that I could hardly move. The outdoor area was also too small.  I think Tao is much better.",
        "The food was below the standard I expect for a mom & pop breakfast joint. I had steak and eggs. Although the steak was tender, it was poorly seasoned - even A1 didn't make it tasty. The eggs were bland as hell and don't get me started on the \\\"ranch\\\" potatoes. If I go to a mom & pop for breakfast I want real potatoes not frozen packaged potato squares. They were simply dismal. The waitress was nice though.",
        "After 3 attempts I think im through with this place. First time chow mein was burned. Second the food tasted like it sat around for a long time and the third it just wasnt anything special. I am not sure if this is because they are not in that great of a location. This wasnt my first experience with Panda express. I have enjoyd their food at other locations just fine.",
        "I love Mojo Yogurt! You can't go wrong with a frozen yogurt company on Mill Avenue. With their late hours, you can practically get a cup at any time!\\n\\nHere's a tip: hit up the goodies bar before you fill your cup with yogurt. Layering the goodies can be fun! And if you are really adventurous, ask for the Cheesecake Bites that they store in the refrigerator in the back. YUM!",
        "Let me say that I do like the atmosphere of Sushi Ken's.  It's friendly, casual, and feels like what I think a sushi place should feel like.  That said, we ordered some tuna sashimi in order to get a feel for what the quality was like before ordering anything else, and I'm pretty sure that what we were served was shipped in frozen.  It was not good.  We ate it out of respect, and left.",
        "Oh my lord no! The dancers here sure are skinny! In truth, the clientele do seem to be having a good time.",
        "Very disappointed in the two girls working here tonight. Most of the toppings were put away by the time we got there @ 9:40 pm. Plain frozen yogurt tonight for the kids. They did not offer any samples and we had to eat in the car since the chairs were already put away. Drive a little farther and go to either Razzleberriez (awesome service and open until 11 pm), or the Yogurtology in Arrowhead.",
        "Not very impressed. The crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza. The sauce was not very flavorful and didn't have any spices to it. I had to add a bunch of crushed red peppers to get some kick into it. The cheese was good and tasted real, but the mushrooms seemed like they were from a can. $23.78 for a 13\\\" medium pizza to go, was way more than this was worth. Disappointed.",
        "Dream swirls is pretty awesome! I like the toppings! Frozen yogurt and cookie dough how could it not be 5 stars!",
        "Service was great.  \\n\\nAtmosphere was great.  \\n\\nSide Caesar Salad and bread were great.  \\n\\nMy side (rigatoni and sauce) was good.  \\n\\nMain course, chicken parm looked great, but the chicken tasted and had the texture of something that came frozen and in a bag.  Was disappointing!!!\\n\\nMy fianc\\u00e9 loved her chicken piccata.",
        "Loving this place.  Yah it's a chain.  So what?  They provide a quality product at a fair price consistantly.  The chianti is great with any pasta on the menu.\\n\\nI always opt for the \\\"create your own pasta\\\".  Very reasonable and you can pick from four sauces, five or six pastas and add veggies, meat whatever you want.  Not a bad deal.  Home baked bread is 5 stars!",
        "Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \\\"home\\\", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service.",
        "The cookies at COOKIEZ are so thin and yummy.. I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor of ice cream or type of cookie. .. But I haven't tried anything too crazy..\\nThe workers here are also VERY friendly and give great customer service.",
        "I really like this place and my wife doesn't.  Mediterranean Pizza.  Good prices. Light on the toppings though.  Which may be good for some.  Fresh ingredients, lots of selection and  brick oven baked.   They get a little lower mark from me because it is a bit small and atmosphere could be a lot nicer if they were larger.  They are sort of part casual dining part fast food diner.  3 of 5 stars for a casual dining experience.",
        "I have been wanting to try City Tavern for a while now. I feel as if I should have tried them years ago. It almost seems as if the restaurant may be cutting corners. The food is subpar. Most of what I had was previously frozen. My egg roll was cold in the middle and the calamari was incredibly chewy. My \\\"sushi grade\\\" tuna was pink, not red. It was basically over priced bar fare.",
        "Very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday. They might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tasteless.\\nPlease improve the dessert section too!!\\nYou have much better option in Vegas for $50 per person...",
        "If I could give 0 stars I would.... Absolute worst sushi and calamari I have ever had! The calamari was rubbery and tasted like they bought it frozen from Costco. I could have bought better sushi from smiths or vons. Service was great, they understood my dissappointment. Sapporo was superb!",
        "This is the only place I go for delicious frozen treats. I recommend this awesome place to everyone. Plus I don't deviate from the vanilla custard because it's all I ever crave!",
        "Rising Sun and Golden Standard is definitely a must have! They use Kobe and Dry aged beef! Awesome beer selection and the ambiance absolutely fit the 'cosmopolitan' feel. If you want to skip the line to Marquee on Friday or Saturday, hang out here. Same Dj, less crowds, better drinks.. I mean where else can you have a burger and fist pump??",
        "The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.",
        "Inexplicably Whole foods switched out their baked goods supplier and now they don't have decent chocolate or almond croissants anymore.   Now I have to go to Panera bread, Starbucks or the local bakeries.   Bad move, I hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this.",
        "After trying a few Chinese places around Campustown, I decided that I liked this place over the others. I really enjoy their orange chicken, the mongolian beef, and the beef with broccoli. Their sichuan food is also worth trying. The atmosphere is okay and the service is acceptable. My complaint is that the price is a little more than others but my favorite dishes taste better here than elsewhere so I am fine with that.",
        "I can't, for the life of me, remember the Barista who assisted me, but she was HILARIOUS and fun!  I would come back just for her customer service.  She was a little short blondie.  \\n\\nThe customer service was great.  It is located near a frozen yogurt place as well. Win!  Win!",
        "Sticky tables, loud, mediocre food for the price, decent saki selection bumped it to 2 stars.  Look for better.",
        "I decided to give this place another try. It was a mistake. They were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case. Service was average. My friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned.",
        "I love this place! I get all of my uniforms for bartending here. They will give you a discount if you tell them you work in the casinos. \\n\\nThe only flaw is that they assume that every girl that comes in is a dancer. That is seriously annoying. Just because you THINK I am a dancer, doesnt give you the right to say it aloud. That is just RUDE.",
        "note that the 2star rating is just compared to all resturaunts not just hawaiin ones. \\nfood was good. i dont know my way around hawaiin cuisine so who knows? i just know it tasted good but left me with a fast food feeling afterwards. \\n atmosphere was like.. nah just do take out. the atmosphere is like an uncomfy mcdonalds made of fake bamboo with pictures of kids in bikinis. srsly kinda creepy.",
        "they always take great care of our little girls, even though one of them is not very friendly to other dogs. they give meds, frozen treats, and for extra, will offer play time and more treats. i especially like the report card they give you at pick up.",
        "Its perfect for checking out fleshy new tat's on beautiful punk rock chicks. But its not a real good place to be dressed up at. Definetly go in something greaser-ish, biker-ish or in just plain chill clothes... This place reminds me of some clubs up in Seattle.\\nGood atmosphere, decent dj although he could get a larger selection of discs.",
        "Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.",
        "What a great little spot in Downtown Phoenix. We were just passing through and thanks to Yelp, we found this gem. The food was fantastic: eggs, pancakes and the corn cookie was heavenly. Will definitely be back.",
        "Had to give the cookie ice cream sandwich shop a chance.  Such a great idea.  I had some medieval madness ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies.  My cookie was warm and slightly melted the ice cream.  Just right.\\n\\nMake sure to check out the \\\"additional ice cream flavors\\\" printed to the left of the counter... in case you want vanilla or cookies and cream.\\n\\nYum!",
        "Very good food!! Great take out. I recommend the Mongolian Beef. Small dining room if you choose to eat at the restaurant.",
        "Dinner was pretty bad. Add slow service and it worsened the experience. Breakfast was much better. Stay away from the day old 1/2 frozen baked goods.",
        "Everyone was very helpful and friendly here. Food was good as well. Had the dungeness crab w/ 2 sides for $22. Can't wait to come back and try the maryland blue crab!!\\n\\n**Update\\nBlue crabs were great, very sweet... But worth it if you don't mind getting your hands dirty!\\n\\nMy favorite. Their snow crab, easy to get to and delicious!!",
        "Soggy bun, Overcooked patty, Frozen fries, Terrible service.  This was probably the worst lunch I've ever had.  Seriously you can get a better burger at McDonalds.",
        "I had only been to the poolside before, but went to the club for the first time! The bouncers were actually friendly, making sure there was enough space to walk around. The sound system here is amazing! Fun to see some great DJs! \\n\\nTwo floors to the nightclub - the one upstairs is a lot larger!"

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",
        "Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria.",
        "Probably one of the best steaks in Las Vegas. Comfortable seating and busy. Very busy. Lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little, but delicious amount you got. For a new restuarant the staff was very well trained. Looking forward to next visit, minus lobster app.",
        "Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in.

We ordered the \\\"better than sex\\\" and  \\\"pink pussycat\\\", both were great. I wish they delivered to Texas!",
        "Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...",
        "I absolutely LOVE this place. I have been here several times after reading about it in las vegas weekly. the food is to perfection everytime! the prices are amazing for this type of quality of food. i LOVEEEE the sauce that they serve on the side of the arepas. they are to die for.",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "My ice chest was stolen from my room which had a coffee commuter cup, three cans of soda, milk, and spoon.  The Front Desk Staff was no help. \\\"Frank\\\" The weekend Manager in Charge  and The Security Officer were the only ones that were helpful.  There has been no follow up from the Motel 6 Staff at 195 East Tropicana Avenue, Las Vegas. I was staying there from September 08, 2011 Through September 10, 2011.",
        "I had both a red tinga as well as a chili verde gordita. I also enjoyed a large cup of the best Horchata in Las Vegas. Fresh and warm, the gorditas were filling and good.....but not great. Good for a quick stop, but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored, spicy, authentic gordita. The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.",
        "The food was pretty good. The service was pretty good. The problem was that it didn't really fit the Bellagio feel, it was like a straight up diner (not a cafe) in a fancy hotel.\\n\\nExpect a diner, not a cafe.",

        "I don't see the difference from the Fitzgerald.  Actually, one of their openings has a D Las Vegas banner and the other opening still says Fitzgerald's.  The casino floor still looks the same and not really impressive.  I definitely understand that the place is continuing a huge renovation so i will just leave it at that.  Hopefully when I revisit this place, my rating changes for the better.",
        "Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila... The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back.",
        "We were at the point in our Las Vegas vacation where we were sick of food and yet still hungry.  So we tried this place out and, yes ma'am, very good.  My husband had a waffle with frozen yogurt and I had the very berry crepes. Not expensive but not a cheap meal, either.  Good to people watch, great for somethin different in the Vegas experience which did not include the word 'buffet'.",
        "of course since i stayed at the Bellagio, i went here to check it out. i knew since i stayed at the Bellagio, that this place would be a tad expensive, which it was. when I was there, the place was packed! my friends and i had bottle service so we did not worry about ordering drinks at the bar. The music was good. I'd go back here if I'm ever in vegas.",
        "Love this hotel! Very kid friendly, breakfast was great and economical. Close to many restaurants and right off the freeway for easy access. Very clean and modern. Pool was clean and good size but towels very small.",
        "Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.",
        "Went again, this time for dinner.  I still say it's not worth it for the price, even more so now after I've been to the Studio B buffet.

And maybe I didn't hate their meat as much this time.",

        "Hamburgers and Onion Rings - the bomb.  They are good.  Service - can't say much for that.  First time, service was not good at all.  Second visit, service was better, but they messed up our orders.  Tortillas soup - 10.00 - very brothy, not much else in it.  Perfect place for burgers and onion rings.",

Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place.",

        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",

I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar.

Yes they gave me a credit...Only an apology when I mentioned I had not received one,,,only excuses.",
        "Tried the eclairs..chocolate & vanilla.  Absolutely wonderfull!  The vanilla was made with real vanilla beans, no extract or flavoring.  Filling was light & creamy.  Moderate pricing for such a high quality product.  The eclairs cost $5.00 for the two and each eclair was about eight inches long.  I would've gladly paid $5.00 for just one!",
        "Have been for late dinner, and happy hour appetizers.  Both good, but only good.  Which is good!!  Italian is top quality for Las Vegas, but with a club inside the restaurant it becomes tough to take serious as a top quality restaurant.  The appetizers are great, cocktails are decent. If you want Vegas flare, it is one of the top places that cater to people who need both liquid and solid.  Definitely worthy!",
        "I hate to leave a negative review because I love getting hair here but I realized today they're ripping people off. I bought hair and it was $99 on the price sticker. When I got home I noticed the sticker had been placed over another. I peeled back the sticker and the other price was $45 and they tried to sharpie through it. Over a 50% markup?!?! I believe I'll start shopping elsewhere!",

        "Easily one of my favorite places in Arizona, let alone Tempe.  And that's from day one... (I was pretty late to the Cornish Party).  The atmosphere is unbeatable... feels like I'm in San Fran or London.  The steak / blue cheese pasty is fannnnnnnntastic.",

The woman working there did not get off the phone or offer to help me the entire time I was there.",

Granted I didn't bring my confirmation number with me, they could not find my reservation at the gate and when I called customer service, since date had passed - no refund was available.

        "Absolutely horrible.  Did take out chopped salad was not worth $11.00.  Small portion and the pizza was ice cold and was like as thin as a piece of paper maybe 3 pieces of the schrieners chicken sausage on it.  Pathetic.  $30 for that meal Are you kidding me. My girlfriend and I arent even full.  We had to go get more food.  Never ever go back.  Get your shit together!!",
        "Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again",
        "first and foremost I LOVE THIS PLACE! by far the best sushi restaurant/atmosphere in las vegas. it has the best of both worlds, amazing food, great bar with gaming and its always happy hour. \\nEvery time my friends and i come we sit at the sushi bar with Olivia, my favorite sushi chef! Shes amazing! Its always a fun and great time every time we come in.",
        "I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.\\n\\nPoor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.",
        "Nice experience. Good price. For me, an hour is too long and 30 is too short.  Go for the 45.",
        "People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I.",
        "Terrible service, terrible food quality and horrifying prices!  Seriously folks you can eat at PF Changs and have far better food, service and pay 1/3 of the cost!  Truly the worst Hot & Sour Soup and Mongolian Beef I have ever tasted, in fact I could only eat a tiny portion of each.  Steve Wynn should be ashamed of himself!",

        "Great food as one would expect, awesome server.  i had won some cash and was tempted by other steak houses that boast 100.00 steaks, but i chose outback, it is always a perfect meal. even tho this one is on the Vegas strip, it is not a tourist trap, prices are just like any other outback. plus you get to ride the elevator behind the giant coke bottle on the strip!",
        "Third time here and each time it is a great experience.  Atmosphere  is fun and relaxing.  A must for a girls pamper day.  Pedicures and gel manicures are amazing and last for weeks.",

        "Girls in Lingerie, explosions, pirates, one-liners, and more girls in lingerie!  What's not to love?\\n\\nIt's a great show to experience at least once.  It's pretty cheesy but hey you're in Las Vegas.  No problem bringing the kids.....they will be amazed by the songs, dancing, and pyrotechnics.",
        "Not just coffee, but don't forget the tea!  Great loose leaf blends and knowledgeable staff to coach on steeping times and the varieties.  They could even cite the amount of caffeine in each. Very impressive.... cannot wait to try the coffee.",
        "Excellent value, exceptional quality. Absolutely the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. We've tried the others, but nothing compares to S21!",
        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "The staff was really friendly and inviting but I was there for two hours for a mani pedi. I found a picture on their yelp site of a design that I wanted. They said yes of course we can do that. My nails look nothing like the picture. It cost $80.00 for both and it looks awful. I was treated nicely but the services they provided were not good and that is  why I won't go back.",
        "Very disappointed. Sand in the scallops. Fish and chips - fish over-cooked. When told waiter, he said he would let know chef know. Came back and said no one else complained. I asked if he thought I was lying. Said no, but no one did anything. Not what I expected from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. My family is English and I have had MUCH better fish and chips from our local take out in San Diego and a LOT cheaper!",
        "$13.98 prime rib in the middle of the Strip.  Great deal when you consider a simple turkey sandwich could cost more than that across the street at the Bellagio or Caesars.  Nice menu, quick service.  Not very large, so I imagine there would be a wait at busy times.  I was there on a Monday night off season.",

My hubby & I ordered 2 iced teas, a cesar salad to share and a pizza each (pizzas are 12\\\" and very thin - not enough for 2 people) -- the total, with tip, was $60.  A little steep for lunch.\\n\\nBetter off going to Grimaldi's.",
        "Best taco I've ever had in my life.  PERIOD.  The price is so far below the astronomical prices of the Strip it isn't even funny.  Authentic, friendly and excellent food quality make this place the best and one of the cheapest meals I've ever had in Las Vegas.  Bravo!",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "I think the rooms need an update. I mean, for the price, they're not spectacular. Staff were really nice though.\\n\\nThe casino and bar/club/restaurant choices are fine, typical Las Vegas. \\n\\nThe lobby is gorgeous, but you don't have to stay there to see it!",
        "Probably my favorite Apple Store besides the one at San Tan Village. Everyone at this location has always been helpful. I've purchased two laptops here and was always offered advice and suggestions for what I was planning on using them for. Only complaint is about the repair prices which seem extremely high in comparison to some third party retailers.",

        "Meh.\\n\\nDuring the lunch rush they're incredibly slow to make something as simple as a turkey sandwich. If you order something pre-made and \\\"hot\\\" be ready to be underwhelmed. I ordered the lasagna and its consistently lukewarm to cold. The chicken parm is the same way. The only consistently good thing on the menu seems to be the orzo pasta salad, which is cold to begin with.",
        "Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation.",

        "Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.",

We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast.",
        "RUDE,RUDE,RUDE is all I can say about this place. If you want to be treated like dirt, this is the place for you. I went in there ro shop and rexeived the worst customer service I have ever receives anywhere. Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "Front staff annoyed me. They have about 3 girls they look like they're 16 or 17. Have no customer service skills or communication skills. I asked her a simple question about the open bar she had no fucking idea how to answer my question. Security guard total asshole. Not to mention they only accept cash.",
        "My previous review was very harsh, but true.  I met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect.  I have had nothing but poor service previously, but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter.  So, I'm upping the stars, hopefully the service keeps improving.",
        "Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good, but the service was flat out horrible.  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down.  The place wasnt all that busy either.",

        "Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.",
        "Chicken Benedict is amazing!",
        "My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",
        "Food was ok, maybe a step up from dennys with a nice selection. I do have to give props for the service though. The server was excellent and the manager, who I overheard talking to the couple in the booth next to us, was bending over backwards to make them happy so the place really seems to want to make their customers happy. So in a nutshell ok food with good service at decent prices. Can't recommend but I might give them a second shot.",
        "Best eggs Benedict ever, although non - traditional. Great quiche but a puny slice. Great fritata, too. Leisurely service.",
        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \\\"They're fine\\\". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning.",
        "We were looking for a great place to eat that wasn't a part of the strip, and was relatively cheap but better than Denny's. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere. Tasty breakfast food which is higher quality than any other breakfast place we've been to. Relatively inexpensive prices. \\n\\nVery impressed and we will definitely be back next time we come to Vegas!",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",

        "I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back.",
        "I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.",

        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "The wheels completely fell of this place!  After enduring a number of weeks here for work I finally gave up living in the slum and moved to a much better location right around the corner.  \\n\\nOne to many mornings with a cold shower, cigarette burnt bedding, mystery stained towels, and horrible smells in the hallways.",
        "Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends.",
        "We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.",
        "Food was really mediocre, I felt like I was eating at Ihops or Denny's but paying a higher price.  The only reason we came here was the $10/pp coupon from purchasing the Vegas pass.  \\n\\nWon't recommend this place to anyone because there's plenty of good eats in Vegas",
        "I was excited to try this place, but sadly i did not get a chance. They advertise that they deliver, but apparently only on busy days, don't know which day that is. Very disappointed.",
        "Nice theater with reclining seats, also since this theater is not even a year old it's not prone to crowds.  While I like this  not being crowed and having my pick of the best seats; I do want them to stay in business so go check them out especially since the first films of the day are always $5.",
        "This place probably has a delicious full menu. But I wouldn't know. The prime rib and the Filet Mignon is so succulent and yummy that I have not bothered to try anything else.",
        "Typical diner food. Not bad not good. Egg and I is a much better breakfast place. I had classic eggs Benedict and hash browns. Nothing really blew our socks off. Husband had turkey and dressing. Little on the dry side. Gravy was bland.",
        "Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as \\\"Chicago Style\\\" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.\\n\\nTheir sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive.",
        "I just threw up the morning after we ate at Gordon Ramsey pub and grill I ordered the salmon which was the worst thing I have ever eaten in my life. The waiter never asked us how our food was and there is no condiments on the table not even salt honestly I want to puke right now thinking about it for someone who critiques food for a living critique your own food",
        "If you are in the mood for breakfast then look no further.  This place is very similar to Denny's but 10 times better with a lot more options.  The portions are large so if you are really hungry then this is the place for you.  Both of my kids loved it and if we are back in the area we will definitely eat here.",

Room has been updated but they need to update the dresser counter, looks old and scratched up.  Why would they update and not change the dressers Beautiful casino and love the forum shops, even though they are expensive.  Loved the pool area.  Would stay there again.",
        "I ordered a Belgian waffle which was good.  My sister ordered the chicken strips and fries.  Her plate was mainly filled with fries.  My friend ordered a milkshake and we wondered where her silver mixing cup was with the rest of the milkshake.  Our waitress was a bit on the slow side and she was not very polite.  The food was good, the service could have been better.  It was funny looking at all the different outfits the employees were wearing.",
        "Much better than last year!  They must have a decent saucier now. The Alfredo was right on.  [Oh my!  I just realized that their sauces must now just come out of a can.  I wish they'd tell us if they are freshly made.)",
        "Food is alright, not bad for a dennys variant. But service....I get better service at McDonald's.",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "They have the BEST springrolls---not fried!  We also love their pad thai---spiced to your palate.",
        "I don't know how this place isn't shut down. Terrible service and the grill obviously wasn't cleaned, my egg had burnt pieces of something stuck to them. It tasted and looked like someone tried to cook the egg on a BBQ. This is the worst Denny's I've ever been to. One star because they seated us quick when we arrived.",
        "You wouldn't think brunch at this place, but you'd be so wrong. Great breakfast with inventive dishes including a unique spin on eggs Benedict and a great pastrami hash. Don't miss the Bloody Mary bar.",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.",

        "Lots of options at good prices.  More creative menu offerings then, let's say, Denny's.  I also love the Wednesday free pie promotion.  I've had the Fresh Fruit & Chicken Salad and the Southwest Salad.  The salads were large and filling and the ingredients were fresh.  I've also had the tomato basil soup and it was all right but a little on the oily side.  Service is friendly and welcoming.",
        "This review is based on a lazy Saturday brunch the weekend before New Years'. I was surprised at how slow it was given that the Strip seemed busy.  Outdoor seating, breakfast all day, and full bar made up my mind about where to eat.  \\n\\nThe food quality was about comparable to Denny's. \\nThe coffee was a little weak but fresh.\\nPortions were generous.\\nService was friendly. \\nI'd go again.",

        "The bar area was nice, but the dining area was off-putting. That side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades. The fresh bread was burnt and tough. The table was a bit crumby. I ordered the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, which admittedly was bland. The server and service were great.",
        "Like an Ihop or Denny's inside Monte Carlo, but not as good. Not expensive, but we should of went to the food court that was around the corner, better price and probably more appetizing.",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Our first time at this location. Seated immediately on a Friday night. Very friendly server named Darius. Ask for him. He is fun, attentive & full of Forrest Gump trivia. I tried to stump him but couldn't. I had the jambalaya which was excellent & spicy & just the right size portion.",
        "Best Jewish deli and bakery in town. Awesome staff, amazing food and out of control baked goods. We try to go to Chompies' at least once a weekend for breakfast. My favorite is the All American with a Poinsettia (champaign and cranberry) to drink.",
        "Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places",
        "Food was OK, but service hella sucked, all due to our waiter Jeffrey Hoth. If you ever go here, stay away from that fat, bald, lazy waste of air. I mean, 30 minutes to get a fucking Coke? Are you serious? And then another 30 minutes for our food. Then the guy had the nerve to hover around us as we ate so that he could get paid, as he was gonna go on break. Grr. Yuck. Bye.",
        "I had the jambalaya and it was very good. GF had the fish and pasta, she loved it. Only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering us.\\n\\notherwise the drinks are great, the food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was very calm!",
        "Really good fried catfish!  I was not really fond of catfish until I tried Jamburrito's way of serving it. The jambalaya rice makes the perfect accompaniment for the crunchy delight. The people serving the food are very friendly and the total experience definitely makes Food Truck Fridays a weekly event to look forward to.",
        "The Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, served with a mushroom-ancho chile sauce, was heaven. Need I say more?",
        "The opening time is definitely a plus. We wondered by at 9:00pm and met a full house. Taste-wise it's just as it, I can't tell too much difference from other similar stores.",
        "What fantastic people! Met the general manager and she couldn't be more genuine. Not to mention helpful. I had a question about the place she couldn't answer, and she took my number and said she would find out and let me know. Gosh.",
        "Waited 1 hour for food!  Someone ordered Benedict no cheese and a bowl with 2 poached eggs arrived! My sunny side up were runny.  $40 for 2 breakfasts and coffee! Waitress didn't even speak English! Ill never go back here again. Worst breakfast ever.",
        "Amazing dinner. \\nEscape to Vegas with my men left us wanting hearty man food. \\nWho better than Ramsey to deliver? \\nGet the sides, Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.\\nSteak cuts rib eye and NY strip to die for. Don't be late- they will hold it against u.",
        "Our experience at the Fig Tree was truly enjoyable. Visiting from out of town, we were happily surprised to stumble upon it. The atmosphere was homey, welcoming with a touch of Southern hospitality. We started out with a great bottle of Meritage and fresh bread with rosemary infused olive oil. We had a great pasta and an awesome filet mignon with yummy fingerling potatoes. We highly recommend this restaurant.",
        "The food is delicious. I've gotten the fettuccine alfredo and the 440 sandwich and both are fantastic. The only turn off is how long they take to make anything. You have to call in and order if you want to avoid waiting 30+ minutes. I've waited 35 minutes for a sandwich before which is simply not worth it, no matter how good it tastes. Definitely call ahead and order.",
        "I had been here once before and I thought it was okay.. But since it's close I decided to try again and it was awful. The girl was not friendly at all and all she did was gossip with the other lady. I tried asking a question and she was rude. Then she was buffing my toe nails and buffed my skin. It hurt so bad and I had a a cut for awhile after. I would never go back ever.",
        "The best meal I ate in Vegas.  I shared the Chicken Benedict.  It was soooooo good. Come hungry.  I will go back next time I go to Vegas.",
        "My husband and I LOVE this place! We have been coming since they opened. We used to travel to the Rainbow location until they opened the one up near where we live in north las vegas. The food is delicious! They have the best eggs benedict in town and I have tried almost everything in the breakfast menu and everything is great! The atmosphere is great and they have a great staff! Love the service!",
        "Slow service,  average food.  In fact, I had a 100% better Cesar salad at pub in Seattle. Lame. The restaurant itself is nice and the bar area looked pretty lively.",
        "If you're reading this...read no further! Just make a reservation, take your ass to the stratosphere, hop on that  elevator that's more like a rocket ship, eat,indulge and enjoy every second of it!!! (And thank me later with desert). K, bye!!!!",
        "High price, takes two or more trips and would not recommend. Looking at other review sites, This is not the company I  want. They advertise a lot, but that does not mean much to me. Quality performance is available from local business at almost half the price with one day service. See my other reviews. Sorry moved on and would not use again.",
        "A good place to eat, trendy. You can't call ahead or make reservations so expect to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table. The food is good, but when I went there I got an Eggs Benedict and it was more of a hard boiled egg, though it was well-seasoned. \\n\\nI'll be giving it another try, but I was much more excited about this place before I tried it.",
        "Since Sambalatte opened its doors in Summerlin, I became a huge fan! I LOVE their Nutella Latte and the variety of tea selections they have. This place makes you feel as if you were not even in Las Vegas! A great escape,awesome lattes...all at Sambalatte ...Goodbye Starbucks!",
        "This place blows.  Food had no taste and shake was below average for a higher than deserved price.  Johnny Rockets blows this place away and I even prefer a Denny's burger and shake for half the price",
        "The customer service here is amazing. I've never been treated so well. Tony takes the time to introduce himself and learns your name. He says goodbye to everyone that leaves and says their name. He gives you a side of garlic knots on the house (the sauce is incredible). I haven't even had the food yet and I already know I am coming back. This is how a business should be ran.",
        "OK, watch out.  I bought 3 pairs of shoes here on June 5, along with three cheap tops.  It was really noisy and I just signed the credit slip. When I got home, they had charged me $95!!! for a pair of sneakers that was marked $18.99.  Im going in tomorrow to see if they will staigghten it out, but they are very hard core and I think I am out about $60.00 Read the slip!!",
        "Paradise Bakery is AWESOME!!! I love the freshly tossed salads, like their Southwest Cesar Salad and a cold cup of their refreshing Mango Tea!!! \\nDELICIOUS!!!! The service is always fun and enthusiastic!! \\n I give them an A+ for sure!!",
        "I walked into Stitched and into heaven.  The clothes are amazing and Jack was friendly and very helpful.  I'm going back tomorrow to check more clothes out.  Jack is the bomb!  Very soon I will have a new wardrobe of fabulousness!  Highly recommended for the individually fashion minded.",
        "Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there.",
        "These guys are a scam! They advertise prices online, but when you show up, the prices they quote you are about 40% less than what they advertise on line. Packed up my 400 lbs of copper and brass and went a couple miles up the street and actually received a fair price for my scrap. Would not recommend these guys to my worst enemy."

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "\\\"Went to Valley Luna on a Sunday for the specials I found using the Happy Hour app. $2 drafts and mimosas. Got there asked about the specials, they would not honor those prices, said they're $2.50. I decided to leave and the waitress bad mouthed me to my girlfriend...\\\"",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",
        "Love these places. I was at one before in Dallas years ago so it had been a while but it was as good as I remembered. Very good drinks, super salad bar but don't fill up on it too much! All the meats they bring were all very good. So were the fried plantains. Incredible service. Always there when you need them. Not there when you don't. Pricey but worth it for a special night out.",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "The pizza is good, but the pasta is outstanding. Nice quaint family outing place, or a great place to take a date for a private dinner. They, also, offer some good salads.",
        "I consider myself a regular at this point. At the beginning when the location first opened there were a couple of rough spots. Now however I feel the place is a great addition to the Old Town mix. Great bartenders good diverse crowd from 21 to 80 . This is what a real pub should be like. If you don't like the pasty choices try the pasta salad with chicken. So happy to see no TVs .",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "Awesome AYCE sushi. They have egg custard which is my favorite. The only down side is its a little brown. But, still delicious. The sushi offered includes nigari and combo rolls. The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",
        "Good food the creamy mermaids are awesome as long as you don't get the old man that's always drunk and if he's sober he's incredibly rude will ignore you and plan to wait a long time to eat if he's your sushi chef. He's a nightmare not a nice guy but the waitresses were pleasant. Just a shame you have to deal with him.",
        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",
        "I had both a red tinga as well as a chili verde gordita. I also enjoyed a large cup of the best Horchata in Las Vegas. Fresh and warm, the gorditas were filling and good.....but not great. Good for a quick stop, but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored, spicy, authentic gordita. The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.",
        "Ok, it is Vegas and Summerlin, after all... so really should not expect authentic Korean food...that said, waitress brought wrong gochujang sauce for bibim bap...a Korean staple! When I initially asked for it, she had no clue! Enough said? Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!",
        "I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location",
        "Pros: Clean basic rooms (the adjacent door was convenient), free WIFI, good location on the strip - especially good since it was right where the finish line for the Rock N Roll Half Marathon! Woot. \\n\\nCons: Wasn't the biggest fan of the lobby...found it a bit dimly lit, not lively, and didn't put me in the best mood.",
        "Gross. \\n\\nLo Mein was incredibly salty, without much other flavor. \\n\\nEgg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.  Their breakfast sausage was also outstanding.  Boy do I wish that they would distribute nationally like Fra Mani does.  Business would grow exponentially.  This place is absolutely outstanding.  Service is great, too!",
        "Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \\\"all-you-can eat\\\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",
        "I don't see the difference from the Fitzgerald.  Actually, one of their openings has a D Las Vegas banner and the other opening still says Fitzgerald's.  The casino floor still looks the same and not really impressive.  I definitely understand that the place is continuing a huge renovation so i will just leave it at that.  Hopefully when I revisit this place, my rating changes for the better.",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila... The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back.",
        "I tried this place after receiving a coupon in the Norterra flyer. I wasn't disappointed. This place has really good pizza and salads! Service was very speedy and their food was excellent. We ended up splitting a salad and a pizza and still had food to take home! Sauce also servers wine and beer which really compliments the food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food.",

Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",

When our bagels took a little longer than expected we were offered 2 more drinks on the house (generous and unexpected!) - the flat white is top quality.\\n\\nEverything looks like it'd be just as good. Quick tip, 'would you like side salad' means extra salad on top of what is served with the food - it'd be cool if they made this a bit more clear!",

        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",

Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.",

        "Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive).",
        "This place is Amazing!!! The food id Delicious and the atmosphere is just fun! They have Salsa Nights on Saturdays and the music is great! Definitely top 5!!!!",
        "Still same real good food but take out only.  Upper St Clair Township does not allow eat in due to lack of parking, I was told.\\n\\nWe ordered a fresh Walnut and gorgonzola salad and sausage calzone, booth were real good.  Love the sausage!",
        "Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!",
        "Nothing to get excited about.  The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ).",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!",
        "Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(",
        "What a fun trip down memory lane! I loved seeing some of the old pinball machines (and a TRON video game! Holy crap!), and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood. Everyone should go here and visit at least once.",

        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "this tj is pretty awesome. great finds here; i even found bliss bath products one otherwise unmemorable afternoon! clean and organized with helpful staff. men's selection is particularily good at this store. shoes always seem over priced whether they be men's or women's. bags, accessories and even jewelry selections are interesting and don't look like leftovers. overall, a great store with great prices. i'm definitely a fan.",

I will try it again, but management should get its act together or this place could also close, which would be too bad and is unnecessary... Just give good service.",

Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. NEVER a bad meal here. I was in Vegas in April and we dined here as usual and then again last week. We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times. It's just that good!!",
        "15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\\n\\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",
        "Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds.",

Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "The food was good a bit overpriced but whatever. The problem was the service the lady working at the register was unfriendly and unresponsive. I had ordered the green salad instead of the Mac salad but instead she gave me the Mac salad. I told her it was wrong and rudely she said it would be 50\\u00a2 more. Waited 20 minutes then just left. The lady that works there is brain dead.",
        "Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. \\n\\nNice low-key atmosphere.\\n\\nFood is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",
        "Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!!  Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had!  I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible.",
        "I brought my car to Clean Freak today. When I got out, the car looked like it was never washed.  Although I paid for the 5.00 wash, I expected my car to be a least clean when it came out.

The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!",
        "Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service",
        "A Charlotte staple in need of a makeover. Generally solid food but sometimes inconsistent - biggest challenge is the atmosphere which is stale and hasn't kept up with the rest of the Charlotte restaurant scene. You can't go wrong by a visit to PC - especially if the weather is nice and you get to sit on the excellent patio. Salads are great here.",
        "Located within treasure island. It's an odd combo a pho shop and coffee shop. I only ordered a Cobb salad $15 and service seemed good, unlike other reviews.  The salad was decent and serving size was large. We spilt the salad between two people  and it was enough food.  I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them.",
        "This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.",
        "Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service",
        "Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again.",
        "Pizza is good.  Got the pasta and it was bland not thrilled with the salad either",
        "Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \\\"yeah I know it's bad.\\\" \\nWon't be going back.",
        "This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial.",
        "Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more ..",
        "The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)",
        "Haha, just stood there behind another guy for ten minutes with No type of worker presence, he ate a bag of chips and we mobbed it to silver mine..if you can't be open 24hrs you should at least lock your doors..lol",
        "In summer it's a great place if you're looking for a terrasse.  They also have live jazz music which adds a nice touch.  The pizzas aren't that great but the crepes and salads are usually a decent bet.",
        "This place gets only 1star as well because of the waitress was nice. One of the hostess as we walked in was rude and did not even smile. I commented for her to smile, the more she gave me this dagger look. We were excited about this new place but with what happened, it will be a while for the next visit.",
        "I was looking for a chair rental company for our upcoming wedding and contacted RSVP. Our wedding venue coordinator also mentioned that she has worked with them in the past, so I decided to give them a call. I spoke with Lorraine today, and in the span of about 20 minutes she quoted me with a very reasonable price, and has already sent over the contract. I could not be happier with her service, and this is one less thing I need to worry about.",
        "Terrible meal, terrible waitress. Nothing good to say about this place. Waitress dumped drink in my lap, forgot 1 out of 4 meals. Would never tell anyone about this place.",
        "And empty club (determined by friend that was already there when we showed up), and empty line, and I need to buy bottle service to get in?  No thanks.  This place is awful.",
        "I just ate here and I order some garlic shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp was so over cooker, it was super hard and I could even taste where it was burnt on the edges. The garlic, needless to say, was also very burnt. I pretty much didn't like the salsa and beans all too much and I generally could have had a much better dining experience here.",
        "Food was very good! Great breakfast variety and lunch options as well. Love the dog friendly patio! Amanda was a great waitress! Very friendly :) I will definitely be coming back.",
        "This place is awesome soon ask we enter the door we were greeted and sat right away. We sat down and immediately was serve Chips and Salsa delicious! And fajitas were the best i ever had seriously will be back.",
        "Fried chicken salad was really good. Good service. Only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth. I said no, a table. Arrived on time and it was packed...and they had saved us a booth.  Kind of pricey, though, unless you get the happy-hour specials. And there were families with kids in there; little kids, so it's ok to bring your family.",
        "Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,",
        "If you like Richardson's you should go there because this place is a cheap knockoff.  The decor is tacky and the carne adasada has no flavor. The bacon wrapped shrimp were dry and charred like a spent ember.  Two stars because the waitress was at least friendly.",
        "At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food.",
        "We went for breakfast and it was a great value for the money. Owner at the front is a nice guy. Only complaint was our waitress, but I think she may have been new and still finding her groove.  Other than that, a-ok.",
        "Many of the reviews of J. Alexander's have been quite descriptive so I'm going to keep mine short and to the point:\\n\\nI did not enjoy my experience here in the least.  Everything about this place is simply \\\"typical.\\\""

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",
        "This is a great local place for the neighborhood. There aren't many general shops or convenience stores within walking distance, so Rolliers is my go-to store. Their employees (beyond the local teens at the registers) are very friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems finding plumbing, storage, or cleaning supplies.",
        "I really wish this review could be great because my wife and I love other mellow mushrooms were we have dined and very happy to have one now uptown. However, the Uptown location doesn't quite seem to be ready for prime time business.  Lack of staff but plenty of seating.  Be prepared to wait.  I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",
        "Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)",
        "Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...",
        "Their food is fine. Their prices are too high for what you get. I won't go out of my way to eat there but if I'll be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food, I'll eat there again.",
        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "I love this place for dinner.  A very nice variety.  Service has always been good for me and the portions are huge.    I would tend to stay away from seafood here though.  I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.  Their breakfast sausage was also outstanding.  Boy do I wish that they would distribute nationally like Fra Mani does.  Business would grow exponentially.  This place is absolutely outstanding.  Service is great, too!",
        "So glad to have an authentic coffee shop walking distance from our office! Great, open floor plan with a killer atmosphere. This will definitely be my friends and my new favorite place to head to for a coffee break. Welcome to the neighborhood, Sip!",
        "boo. hiss. \\n\\nfor some reason i'm just not a fan. the service was simply horrible, and quite unacceptable for such a baller hotel. \\n\\ni asked for the front desk to complete a small task such as deliver envelopes to other hotel guests. i was less than impressed when they lost the envelopes 4 separate times! also, they charge $2.50 to deliver an envelope. lame. \\n\\nnot. rad.",
        "Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \\n\\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\\n\\nGet in here!!",
        "I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!",
        "Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.",
        "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.",
        "Still same real good food but take out only.  Upper St Clair Township does not allow eat in due to lack of parking, I was told.\\n\\nWe ordered a fresh Walnut and gorgonzola salad and sausage calzone, booth were real good.  Love the sausage!",
        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",
        "I was introduced to Mitchell's by a friend of mine and have been a big fan ever since! \\n\\nThe staff is always very welcoming and everyone at the bar always look like they're having a great time.\\n\\nTheir garlic parmesan wings are usually a go to for myself and friends, along with a Titos vodka of course. I look forward to many more happy hours to come!",
        "Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however.",
        "Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip.",
        "For the food, price & service this place has to be the best gyro restaurant in Avondale. It's a little hidden gem in this neighborhood. Food is always good. The service is always fantastic. The two young men behind the counter are always friendly & efficient. Definitely one of my favorite places!",
        "GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees.

        "Had their breakfast burrito (without sausage) and it was amazing, and the price was reasonable too.",
        "I had the sausage pizza and thought it was great. I think the menu described it as a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the sausage is from Chicago, but this is not deep dish. Actually pretty thin. But I definitely liked it and would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. I was there too late for it, but they were advertising half off pizza during the late afternoon.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong.",
        "The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good.

        "Awesome food for great prices, just make sure your thorough when ordering (point to menu, pictures etc) as English isn't their first language, we received something we didn't order. \\nAwesome Thai Tea, Pho, spring rolls & egg rolls. The squid wasn't great, fried, and lacked flavor.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",
        "larger stores in phoenix, large selection of fresh meat and seafood and a great selection of microbrews",
        "Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "My friend got the wrong sandwich ordered & my stuffed burger was just stuffed w/ mushrooms. Blue cheese dressing poured over top of burger making a mess.",
        "Rent affordable! Accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds. Staff is friendly. Quiet neighborhood.",
        "Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back",

The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",

        "Good Persian food with a courteous staff. Nice to have in the neighborhood.",
        "Why is it, there are 20 something registers but only 3 open? Every time I go there in the evening, there's always a line and I mean line as in 10-15 people in 2 lines. \\nAlso why the crap do I need to show my receipt when you just seen me walk from the register after paying for my items?",
        "Absolutely horrible.  Did take out chopped salad was not worth $11.00.  Small portion and the pizza was ice cold and was like as thin as a piece of paper maybe 3 pieces of the schrieners chicken sausage on it.  Pathetic.  $30 for that meal Are you kidding me. My girlfriend and I arent even full.  We had to go get more food.  Never ever go back.  Get your shit together!!",
        "Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also",
        "Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!",

Huge, soaring high ceilings, tons of natural light, and fully stocked.\\n\\nI was there the day of the iPad 2 launch (not there for the iPad, just on the same day) just to browse.  Saw the requisite line of 'opening day' folks on the side of the building, with their friendly neighborhood Apple Store employees passing out snacks and drinks.  Love that.",
        "Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!",
        "Had a nice breakfast, I tried the Mexican Omelette and it was very good. I recommend getting the salsa on the side as my omelette had a lot of salsa on it. They had fresh squeezed lemonade which was really good as well. If you need to get some breakfast this place was great since it's in a nice location.",
        "Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine.",
        "Best fine dining in Scottsdale area. We were seated outside the last time we went and had a fabulous view. It couldn't have been better.\\n\\nThe cocktail list is amazing - lots of unique drinks -- all great -- must try when you go. \\n\\nWe've mostly ordered the specials and have loved everything we've eaten. The seafood is amazing. You will not be disappointed.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "This place sucks. Be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill.  40 bucks for dragon roll...come on. 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi. Should have went to Mandalay Bay or Luxor for some fine seafood.",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",
        "I never really liked this place. Every time I dined here I always had a bad meal. Not worth the money. The seafood dishes are bad and the meat dishes are even worse. I think Red Lobster is better, not by much. Save your money and do not even come here.",
        "Elements is a gift shop in Aria that sells cigarettes , snacks and some interesting , random gifts and suveniors . They had blackjack strategy cards for $2 which was kinda random but nice .

I mean, really really irritated.  Not even halfway through the call I was already tired of the attitude, so I decided to hang up.  This household doesnt support business that act like they dont want our business. MANAGER  That girl needs a serious talking to in regards to customer service.",
        "The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The salsa tasted like spicy tomato soup, the tortillas were hard, but I had a veggie fajita and they brought out beef, I am vegan so had to ask for just veggies but when the veggies came out they were good lots of variety, broccoli, squash, zucchini, and mushrooms.",
        "Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.",
        "Been there 4 times already and Hot n Juicy has not disappoint our family!!!! Awesome service by Myra and Trent and great seafood. We will definitely be back. Great job !!!'",
        "I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good.  So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood.",
        "This is our neighborhood grocery store. Never reviewed a grocery store before. The meat is great, bakery is tasty, nice and friendly deli staff, and they are DEAD serious about getting you out of there when you're ready to go. Even have a person staffed just to monitor lines. You're in, done, and out as quickly as possible. That's what I'm looking for....plus the cheap gas. :)",
        "The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \\\"krab\\\", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.",
        "I come from the land of Publix so imagine my disappointment when I moved here?  There is no seafood department. There is a lack of selection and cleanliness in the meat department.  They only ever have one or two  checkout lanes open plus the self checkout open.  Use the self checkout if you dare.",
        "I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.",
        "Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "For a seafood buffet I was not impressed. Crab legs were good. Lobster tails were small and chewy. Prime rib was good. Oysters were small. Desert selection was small but pleasing. Overall, ok buffet but I don't think I would return.",
        "This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\\\" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\\\"",

        "Very basic and nit very good. plastic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...Fruit, cereals, and ughurt...Kind of like a high school cafeteria. Really bad when you compare it to M.",
        "I have had my fair share of buffets in Las Vegas, but the Wynn buffet was quite a disappointment. At $35 per person for brunch, the buffet lacked both variety and flavor. The Asian food station was bland, the sushi was too fishy and the seafood unappetizing. Italian food was decent though but the desserts were average. I was expecting more from this place but it let me down. Service was great though.",
        "If you are looking for the freshest seafood in town, this is the best place to go. The portions are perfect, where you are satisfied but not overwhelmingly stuffed. The food feels more organic and clean in that I feel they use simple ingredients and don't try to add to many \\\"fillers\\\" for taste. If I was to pick anywhere in Birmingham to impress someone, this would be my choice.",

        "Highly recommended. Great food at very reasonable prices. Had fried mushrooms and pasta.",
        "Great ice cream and for a cause!  Only open during business hours.  For each different flavor a portion goes to a cause i.e. to help with someone's medical bills or to replace a home that burned down.  \\n\\nThey have about 20 different flavors and basic toppings (no sundaes).",
        "Hmm.  Don't know anything about Peruvian food but it was just okay.  Had fried yucca, which was pretty good, also a slow cooked beef called Seco, and a shrimp dish.  We'll give it a second try but it was a little disappointing.  The place bills itself as Peruvian-Chinese but there were only a few items that were actually fusion dishes and the one I tried, a fried rice, was passable but nothing special.",
        "Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as \\\"Chicago Style\\\" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.\\n\\nTheir sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive.",
        "My husband and I LOVED our food tour of the Mile End neighborhood. We tried lots and lots of eclectic food, learned a lot about the neighborhood, and really enjoyed our tour guide Marc Andre. This was a great way to be introduced to the city as brand new visitors- we couldn't recommend this tour enough to others. Certainly a great value for the price.",
        "this Walgreens is on STEROIDS. No, seriously, it is. \\n\\nWhat you need, they have.  The best part of this Walgreens is that they have a JUICE BAR!!!   Sooo needed after nights after nights of drinking!  Fresh squeezed juice and delicious combos!!!\\n\\nTry the 'Lucky Charm' and the \\\"Cash Out'... delicious freshly squeezed juices! so healthy.",
        "If you like Joe's Crab Shack ... then maybe this is your funky Medina.\\n\\nNoisy cramped environment with Chinese quality seafood served in a plastic bag that you open and eat directly off the table with your fingers. \\n\\nYa... Hoo!\\n\\nIts just not my ... bag!",
        "This place is the shit!!! Especially when you can walk across the street! Welcome to the neighborhood!",
        "Not very impressed. The crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza. The sauce was not very flavorful and didn't have any spices to it. I had to add a bunch of crushed red peppers to get some kick into it. The cheese was good and tasted real, but the mushrooms seemed like they were from a can. $23.78 for a 13\\\" medium pizza to go, was way more than this was worth. Disappointed.",
        "Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!",
        "Rating is for the breakfast. The American breakfast with toast, eggs, hash browns with a choice of bacon or sausage is sooo delicious. They make it fresh and usually it's a less than 10 minute wait time. Some day I may try one of the lunch/dinner options like the burgers and fries.",
        "I bought two overpriced drinks -- a vodka soda and a vodka cranberry -- from a grouchy bartender who skipped over people who had been waiting for much longer in order to serve loud drunk girls.  Dude, all I wanted was to buy these drinks and go on my way.  There were, at most, 7 people at the bar.  Took 15 minutes to get a couple of weak drinks.  Should have saved my money.",
        "Expensive? Yes. But everything that's good in vegas is. Good spot off the strip, nice ambiance, great menu selection. Great craft cocktails. Steaks were excellent, as promised. The seafood options tasted very fresh, and presentation was overall great. If you are at the palms and want \\\"good\\\" food. This is your best option",
        "Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \\\"home\\\", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service.",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision."

        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",

        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",
        "Added to my list: Yelp made me do it!\\n\\nGreat atmosphere and excellent food. Friendly staff - even offered me a blanket for my lap since we were dining outside near the fireplace.\\n\\nDefinitely get the grilled corn app. I've had it at other places and this is one of the best preparations.",
        "Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular.",
        "Still same real good food but take out only.  Upper St Clair Township does not allow eat in due to lack of parking, I was told.\\n\\nWe ordered a fresh Walnut and gorgonzola salad and sausage calzone, booth were real good.  Love the sausage!",
        "Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there.\\n\\nThe food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!\\n\\nOverpriced for the quality of food and service. \\n\\nI highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.",
        "Pinky's is a great place to stop for breakfast, or to grab a quick sandwich. The prices are good, and the service is friendly. It's the perfect place to take your really picky nephew who won't eat anything but grilled cheese or spaghetti... because they have something that he will eat.",

        "Love this place. I usually order for pick up and i usually make my own pizza. Grilled chicken with jalapeno. The crust and sauce are amazing. If you decide to dine in they have specials like 2 slices of cheese and a drink for around $5.95, I think? But the food is always good and service is always on point. I'm definitely a regular here.",
        "They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",

        "I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\\n\\nI will never go back there again.",

I had a slice of the banana bread which was good and the world's smallest mocha, which wasn't that good and was $4. I feel better knowing I got a free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!

        "Decent food. Ordered the Sicilian pizza not knowing what it really was. The crust was super crunchy I was hoping for doughy. Place is really nice inside and the service was good.  Huge portions. I don't think ill return just wasn't for me. But is worth a try",
        "We love Vietnamese restaurants, unfortunately this one just does not stack up against the average, maybe too much to expect in Vegas? Everything seems a little sub-par. Price is too much ($11 for extra large pho vs $8 average), you call that grilled beef? Seems like pork to me. That is pork chop? Seems like small pieces to me.",
        "went here for the first time & I have to say I was satisfied with their food. we ordered the chicken & beef bulgogi and grilled saury, they were all really delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars for the food & atmosphere alone, but I had to take one star off for slow service & some dishes on the menu are a bit over priced.",
        "Great place. Tons of meat. If you're in to Grilled meat this is the place for you. A bit on the pricey side especially with all the buffets in Vegas.  Good service and atmosphere. A great place for a group dinner.",

Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",

        "If you want a very filling and enjoyable sandwich for a great price, try out Capriottis.  The first sandwich I ever tried was a Bobby, which is Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and filling that I was full after half a sandwich.  You get a mix of turkey, gravy, stuffing, and more goodies.  There are other great hot sandwiches available as well.",
        "The smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx. The chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly \\\"Sinaloa.\\\" The chicken comes with rice, beans, a grilled jalape\\u00f1o,  tortillas, and a small side salad. The beans and rice taste home made and the chicken is delicious.",
        "Maybe because it's a Sunday or a brand new menu but service was extremely slow!  Server was a nice lady. However there were literally 3 other customers in the bar.   Food is average. Your typical bar food.  Very selected ( burger, grilled ham and cheese) however beer is cheap and cold!!!! Just order 2 at time cause it may take a while to get that second drink!",
        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",

Great for breakfast (we wake up late) and it's portable, so you can take it on the strip or to your favorite machine (not recommended if you're rolling craps) and they're both tasty and cheap!\\n\\nAround 6 bucks for a tasty good sized sandwich. Try the Hawaiian and the Italian. I loved those and will definately be back next time I'm in Vegas!",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",

I ordered the lasagna and its consistently lukewarm to cold. The chicken parm is the same way. The only consistently good thing on the menu seems to be the orzo pasta salad, which is cold to begin with.",
        "Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip.",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",

        "I haven't had a lot of good experience with the buffets in Vegas, and this one was no different.  The crowd was huge of course, but we got through pretty quick.  But for the price ($37 or something like that) the food just wasn't very good.  Lots of it was lukewarm and not very appealing looking.  I guess I need to try one of the more traditional steak and lobster, old-school, casino restaurants for a good buffet in Vegas.",

        "They took over 30 minutes to prepare our food. I asked for my meal to be well done/crispy.  They brought my entree out and it was as soft and white as a baby's behind.  I sent it back. The dish came back darker but not crispy. AndFrustrated, I gave up. My family on the other hand enjoyed their entrees: a sub and a fried food platter.",

They were bugged I came in and told me I couldn't eat inside, and that i'd have to eat on the patio. Food isn't that good either. Rice and Meat were all extremely dry.",
        "The wheels completely fell of this place!  After enduring a number of weeks here for work I finally gave up living in the slum and moved to a much better location right around the corner.  \\n\\nOne to many mornings with a cold shower, cigarette burnt bedding, mystery stained towels, and horrible smells in the hallways.",
        "This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again.",
        "I love breakfast food and was told this is the place to get it. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and it was terrible. It was more grease that gravy. I had to hold back throwing up. The potatoes that come with it were great but they did not hit the spot and I had to run to CVS to grab a snack to hold me over till dinner. \\n\\nSkip this place, go to Matt's Big Breakfast.",
        "I just tried Crust for the first time today and I am in love!  True to the name, the crust is crispy and tastes like a breadstick (they use parm cheese and garlic butter).  Prices are reasonable I'll be back for more!",
        "Dinner here with family members. Large, varied menu. Heather was our server. She was pleasant and efficient. I had the ribs and salad  bar. Salad bar had a good selection of veggies and dressings. Ribs were OK but not stellar. Mashed potatoes were real and gravy was tasty.. I want to try the chicken fried chicken sometime. My sister had the blt and it was loaded with bacon.",
        "Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns.

        "Fresh, juicy, and flavorful.  Be sure to get the double double to enjoy the full flavor of the meat and cheese.  Truly fresh veggies and I really like the sauce that resembles a homemade thousand island dressing.  The fries are standard issue julienned fries but are hot out of the fryer, crispy and just right salted.  This location was busy but not impossible to get a seat.  Everything seemed clean in spite of the crowd.",
        "Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!

Will be going back again soon!",
        "Best grilled chicken in Charlotte! Pio Pio!",

We'll recommend and come again.....",
        "Unbelievably uninspiring breakfast. Chilaquiles was cold so I got the biscuits and gravy. Dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor. I have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad I felt I had to. Nothing original on the breakfast menu..will not return.",

The location of the hotel is great, there are many attractions near by on the strip.\\nThe negative aspects of the hotel pertain to the bathroom. Although the bathroom is a good size, the toilet and shower are made for the hulk. The water in the shower feels like a pressurized hose and the toilet seems capable of flushing anything. Just remember not to sit on the toilet when you flush! Lol",

        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",

        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "We came because of the $5 glasses of wine and oh were they good. Viogner blend is crisp & fresh, the cab franc was smoky.  The service was great our waitress was very candid & funny. The apple & prosciutto bruschetta are both amazing, you can mix & match.",
        "First time at Cesars stayed in the Forum towers.  Beautiful batroom, with ceiling and wall shower, tv in mirror.  Room has been updated but they need to update the dresser counter, looks old and scratched up.  Why would they update and not change the dressers Beautiful casino and love the forum shops, even though they are expensive.  Loved the pool area.  Would stay there again.",
        "Last time in Vegas we stayed at Luxor (for sure we will NEVER return). Room was pretty decent and clean - great price - perfect location on Strip - very decent amenities around shared with Paris.

Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!",
        "The food was great, but the service was disappointing.  We came here for a late lunch after spending a few hours at Qua Spa.

When I arrived, I was told that was not possible with no more availability, and I should've called ahead.\\n\\nRenovation FAIL: The bathroom that we had has no tub, but an open Euro / Gym style shower area, which is fine.  Only if that area is not built higher than the rest of the bathroom floor.  Every time we shower, we get an instant flood in the bathroom.",
        "Had curry noodles with chicken, as spicy as they make it. It was pretty spicy, but I wasn't crying and sweating from my forehead like a few of the other good pad Thai places around Vegas. Chicken and vegetables were fresh and simple. I will have this again for sure. Eat it with chop sticks,everything just falls off the fork. \\nVery nice atmosphere, very friendly, extremely attentive staff.",
        "I've tried and tried to find something I like at these restaurants and I just can't come up with a reason to go back. \\n\\nI tried the Lo Mein with chicken. It smelled good but, what I got was 3 lbs of noodles in an overly sweet sauce with a few julienne carrots and few sprouts. The chicken was dry and chewy. I just don't get the draw.",

        "Spotty service, haughty attitude, and mostly food misses has brought this place down. Terrible accompanyments ruin the burrata and mozzarella. The pastas are heavy and after trying them all, there is only 1 I would ever order again. This place tries to be a foodie find but after several disappointing visits, it's time to give up.",
        "Always good food and wine here. Tonight we each had the green salad with beets. My wife added grilled NC shrimp (an $8 add on). Nicely prepared and flavored. I had the salad without any add ons, but I once again succumbed to the sliders; done perfectly.  We left with a smile on on faces.",
        "Red velvet pancakes are the bomb, fluffy soft, not too sweet.  They made eggs well with crispy edges.  Large portions.  Unfortunately,  no specialty coffees.  Kinda out of the way to travel and neighborhood a little iffy. Food delicious,  very Hawaiian with spam options.",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "While visiting Vegas for a friend's wedding, my hubby & I wanted to try this place after hearing great things about their alcoholic (GASP) shakes. I had a Malibu Barbie - it was OHHHH SOOOO YUMMY. We also had a Salmon Burger and Veggie Falafel Burger. Both were quite good, and reasonably priced. Definitely check it out!"

The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food.",

BTW Mariana the Barista is awesome, I come back because of how friendly she is.",

        "Uncomfortable beds, tiny cramped rooms, and too far away from everything. I guess you can't beat the price, though - hence the two stars. And the tourists are great to hustle at the poker table. Oh, and the blackjack dealers are all scantily dressed and dolled up - so that's a plus if you like that sort of stuff.",

        "In a city full of Fry's supermarkets, Sunflower Market is an excellent alternative for ASU denizens looking for cheapish foods, Hippie-style, especially since the only Trader Joe's is quite a drive away.  On weekends, they occasionally have BBQs...I grabbed 2 hamburgers for 2 bucks yesterday.",

        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book."

While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

Their employees (beyond the local teens at the registers) are very friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems finding plumbing, storage, or cleaning supplies.",

Came with fries and a drink. \\nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \\nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \\nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome.",

The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!",

It's not brain surgery people!!!!",

There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",

The pizza is decent and they have some good beer choices on draft including OMB. The bowling alley can be very busy and it's not cheap but you will have fun.",
        "We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",

I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go...",

When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",

They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time.",
        "You can never go wrong with Maggiano's. Rigitoni D is the best! I was surprised however this one wasn't crowded on a Sunday evening. The food was wonderful. The waiter did make us feel a bit rushed when ordering but accommodated our children very well.",

        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",

The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!",
        "The BBQ is decent, depending on what you get (the brisket is meh, the chicken is pretty good, the ribs are decent).  The Saturday college football viewing is nice.  The service is friendly, even when your kids are making a huge mess.  It's definitely going in the Saturday afternoon rotation.",
        "You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.

        "Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \\n\\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\\n\\nGet in here!!",

I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized...",
        "I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",

        "When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \\\"certified technicians\\\" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else.",
        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "I visited Kierland Commons this past weekend for dinner, and I loved the setup! \\nIt was like metropolitan shopping village! There were a lot of great stores, and I liked that there were also smaller boutiques mixed in with the brand retailers. \\nIt is all outdoors, so it can get hot, but at night, it would still be a great place to stroll around, shop and grab a tasty bite!",
        "Really like Club 36; I'll be staying here for every Vegas trip unless I get comp'd a free stay somewhere else. The accomodations were really comfortable and the staff was extremely hospitable.",
        "Dear Lord. We've been sitting here 45 minutes and got 1 drink and still no food. IT'S SATURDAY. And it's EMPTY.  We are only staying to see how long it takes at this point. Completely horrible experience. I may not stay at the hotel again I'm so upset.",
        "Calm down, people. \\n\\nIt's pricey and pretty average. Go somewhere else if you can, but go if you have to, because it'll hit the spot if you want it enough.  #Firstworldproblems",
        "The food here was okay and the prices are reasonable, but one thing I would say is that front line need while serving food need to be keep a lot cleaner than it is now. To many places at the front counter there cross contamination with the food.  With some focus and people who care this place can be great.",
        "Jodi is the best. I can't imagine going anywhere else now that I've found her! She is incredibly thorough with her cut and color and ensures that she understands exactly what you want. I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!",
        "Hamburgers and Onion Rings - the bomb.  They are good.  Service - can't say much for that.  First time, service was not good at all.  Second visit, service was better, but they messed up our orders.  Tortillas soup - 10.00 - very brothy, not much else in it.  Perfect place for burgers and onion rings.",
        "Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen.",

        "Although we typically do not like buffets we tried this, thinking that since it is at the Wynn, it would be good.  The only thing that was half way decent was the pastries.  Everything else was typical dry, cold, and crappy buffet food.",
        "Freddy is fantastic!  I needed a valve replaced in my toilet so it would flush and called Freddy who arrived within an hour on a Sunday and charged me less than half of what other plumbers were quoting me for a Sunday repair.  He's very honest and reliable...THANK YOU so much for your help today!",
        "During marching season, my boyfriend and I went here nearly every Friday for date night. We still go every few Fridays, as we absolutely love it here! The food is delicious, especially the curry and coconut ice cream. The servers are always kind, they tend to try keeping conversations short and to the point. Its an extremely nice restaurant.",
        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "Although it is a plastic paddys, it was a high energy plastic paddys last Saturday night.  We had lots of drinks and enjoyed watching the people and having our kidney stones pulverized by the driving bass.  Nobody singin about Danny Boy or how much they hate  the fuckin Brits in this joint!\\n\\nWe had fun but, if you are gonna call yourself an Irish pub, do something Irish.",
        "Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.",
        "I love this place because of the great food and I enjoy how they have a separate dining area from the bar. The different styles of burgers are great! We enjoyed watching a hockey game on the big screen in the dining room. Go on a Monday when the burgers are $5. I personally wouldn't pay $8-11 for a burger.",
        "Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills",
        "There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible.",
        "I brought my car to Clean Freak today. When I got out, the car looked like it was never washed.  Although I paid for the 5.00 wash, I expected my car to be a least clean when it came out. The wash did not even remove a leaf that was on my car! I went to the car wash at 59th and Bell. Will never go again!",
        "Friends were staying here over EDC weekend... They had a fabulous suite that included two beds and couches and a niiiice bathroom! The beds were comfortable as HELL and the couch wasn't bad either! And when we ran out of towels, housekeeping brought us some more STAT. I'd love to unofficially stay here again sometime!",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
        "Stopped by Marquee for the Armin Van Buuren concert during EDC weekend and it was extremely nice. The stage area and dance floor is rather small but the light show and effects really make up for it if you can find your way out there. Overall I definitely much preferred Marquee over Tryst and Surrender.",
        "Ambions-Nice for gora chamda's- brown chamdas look else where!\\n I'm serious, you will not like eating at a neat & clean place like one of those stylish service and quantity of those of peasants\\n\\nFood-Nice level of spice and don't forget to mention that you want Indian spice.\\n\\nOverall- I might check in if I'm in that area",
        "Its been a few years since I've been, but damn this pizza was good!. I remember it gets really hot (in the summer) and noisy on weekend nights. Otherwise, a wonderful place to go with friends, share a bottle, eat some tasty pizza, and go home happy. Clearly a must-try.",
        "Decided to come in this weekend to try the new brunch offerings and WOW was it good. The restaurant features build your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bars with plenty of garnish choices. I ordered the chicken and biscuit skillet (which I shared with my friend because it is so large) and it was delicious! The chicken was most and flavorful and served with fresh cheddar bacon biscuits. Will definitely be back!",

He then made me wait for 25 minutes as he continued to just stand around. \\n\\nOnce again, terrible experience. Do NOT go to this store.",

        "I HATE clubbing and HATE people who refer to themselves as clubbers. This place is about as much fun as church on Sunday and has just as many fake people as Church as well. Stay away unless you want to be surrounded by douche bags.",
        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "I was looking for a chair rental company for our upcoming wedding and contacted RSVP. Our wedding venue coordinator also mentioned that she has worked with them in the past, so I decided to give them a call. I spoke with Lorraine today, and in the span of about 20 minutes she quoted me with a very reasonable price, and has already sent over the contract. I could not be happier with her service, and this is one less thing I need to worry about.",
        "I hate to leave a negative review because I love getting hair here but I realized today they're ripping people off. I bought hair and it was $99 on the price sticker. When I got home I noticed the sticker had been placed over another. I peeled back the sticker and the other price was $45 and they tried to sharpie through it. Over a 50% markup?!?! I believe I'll start shopping elsewhere!",

        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "AC just died on Sunday and after looking at Yelp I found these guys with glowing reviews. I see why. They were consistant on what time they would be there and they diagnosed the issue quickly. They were informative and friendly. That is a great way to recieve repeat business. Hope the AC doesnt fail anymore this summer but if it does Im calling the Flores'",
        "I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\\n\\nI will never go back there again.",
        "Cute place, but a bit pricey-good setup on Saturday mornings next to the farmers market. I had a slice of the banana bread which was good and the world's smallest mocha, which wasn't that good and was $4. I feel better knowing I got a free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  I will have to try some food next time I'm near here.",

Glad they were open since most places closed early.\\nFriends got steaks, sushi, rolls, sashimi....\\n\\nI got eggplant and mushroom toban? i think.. IT was absolutely delicious. Along w a bottle of good sake",
        "If I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you!

If it's a pricey Vegas buffet, I expected way more than what Wynn offered. \\n\\nCame here on a Sunday night and there was no line.  \\n\\nThe food selection was alright, or perhaps I was in a rush to make my way through everything.\\n\\ni did not discover anything that I wanted to go back for a second serving.",
        "I like it. I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant. And they have a few things on the menu you don't see everywhere else, and its all delicious. I dream about their pumpkin curry!"

        "This is a great local place for the neighborhood. There aren't many general shops or convenience stores within walking distance, so Rolliers is my go-to store. Their employees (beyond the local teens at the registers) are very friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems finding plumbing, storage, or cleaning supplies.",
        "Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew.",
        "Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.",
        "Some days on the way to work I will make a stop here... I order the same thing The Southwestern bagel sandwich it's always really good I would say split it with someone it's really a lot of food plus it comes with a cup of fresh fruit... It's a good start to a day I would say.",
        "Dined at Micky and Mooch for the first time two weeks ago. Ordered the filet oscar style with bearnaise over asparagus. Delicious. The seven layer chocolate cake is to die for. Old school ambiance. Live music which makes it a little loud. Very good service. Can't wait to return.",

        "Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often.",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.  Their breakfast sausage was also outstanding.  Boy do I wish that they would distribute nationally like Fra Mani does.  Business would grow exponentially.  This place is absolutely outstanding.  Service is great, too!",
        "Atmosphere is lovely, and most of the time the staff is awesome. If you like strong coffee, be sure to specify so they make it strong! :)\\n\\nPrices are good. Best hummus I've had in a long time.\\n\\nChocolate chip cookie was delicious,.\\n\\nToxic shake is to die for! Amazing.",
        "My Wife and I have had many great experiences.  We have had multiple Acupuncture treatments with Krissy with great results.  Not only is she very knowledgeable, but also real nice.  At this point we must have referred at least a dozen people to Krissy and everyone thanks us later.",
        "Did not like this place at all. It was small and very empty. Now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening, but we left and went right to the mirage's other club, and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun (5 minutes after this place).  So, not sure what the story was on that.",
        "Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!",
        "I visited Kierland Commons this past weekend for dinner, and I loved the setup! \\nIt was like metropolitan shopping village! There were a lot of great stores, and I liked that there were also smaller boutiques mixed in with the brand retailers. \\nIt is all outdoors, so it can get hot, but at night, it would still be a great place to stroll around, shop and grab a tasty bite!",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "I took my car there yesterday after it stalled at a red light. The staff there greeted me almost immediately and ran a test on the car. He identified the problem and was able to fix it right away. I was in and out within ptetty quickly considering. Very professional and gave me the information I needed to make a decision on what services were needed. No pushing or pressure to get services. Thanks Jiffy Lube! I will definitely be back!",
        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "Easy to make appointments on line or calling in, no long waits for an appointment.  Appointments begin on time.  Dr Steed and staff - knowledgeable with great customer service.  Contacts and glasses come in within days of order.",
        "Good spot on Mill to try a wide variety of beers.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable of the beers, which is important in a place like this.\\n\\nIt is a bit loud but they do have an upstairs area that I would recommend if you're with friends and want to have a conversation.",
        "Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!",
        "Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \\\"three amigos\\\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!",
        "Un service chaleureux, un couscous g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reux, des dattes aux amendes savoureuses pour accompagner un excellent th\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la menthe. Le coin berb\\u00e8re est un must!",
        "They were able to take on my Galaxy Note 2's broken LCD.  They lived up to their promise of time and beat everyone in town on price.  They were knowledgeable, friendly, and tested everything in front of me before I left.  Well worth the money.",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible.",
        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  \\n\\nAnd definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.\\n\\nI'll be back again!!",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "Excellent place to grab a bagel and cup of coffee. I have been going there for years. It is a pleasure to be greeted by name. Keep up the Great job.",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)",
        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "Went looking for a Sonoran Dog and heard this place had a Phoenix Dog that was close to a Sonoran Dog. It was further then I use go for food but closest place with a Sonoran Dog. It was YUMMY!!! So were the onion rings. Not over priced either. The hot dogs are all beef and deep fried. Very clean and nice services.",
        "The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table.  I do have to say that i didnt like the food.  I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste/look like.\\n\\nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them.",
        "This is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station.  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",
        "Very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money... I did however purchase the 3 for $57 so we chose this the Secret Garden at mirage and Bodies the exhibition at Luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3!",
        "My wife and I really like this place. Its a casual atmosphere, friendly wait staff, good food. The manager is very knowledgeable about local beers and even made me a custom beer flight. They have a big selection of local draft beers. Wings are good, burgers excellent, good deserts. I've never had a bad meal here. I've only sat in the bar area. I've been 6 or 7 times and the service and food always consistently good.",
        "All I remember is a HUGE and delicious chicken nacho. There was so much cheese that the waitress actually brought us extra chips to scoop it up. And it was ridiculously cheap. I'll go back sometime and see if other dishes are as good.",
        "Entire experience was outstanding from spotting Don (husband of Vicky from the Real Housewives of the O.C) to my first time having brussel sprouts and Kobe NY strip,  the BF had Hangar Steak and for dessert we have a Jasmine Panna Cotta with Poney and Pears.\\n\\nI quite do not understand how there are vegetarians out there.  I love the smell and taste of beef!",
        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",
        "Terrible service. The guy was very mean. I'm glad I am just a tourist. But don't go here. There are other great kosher places around town. Jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff.",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "Very yummy! It's really fun to try all the different flavors here, and it's a cool place to take friends or out of town guests. Everything is so unique, and it's so cool that all the items are made in the store. The staff is also friendly and knowledgeable.\\n\\nJust thinking about this place is making me hungry!",
        "The chicken snitchel was the best! We got a combo to try weiner chicken and pork chop ...next time I will get just the chicken snitchel as the flavors were amazing!! We also started with the beef vegetable soup...took me back to my youth in England. Very authentic. The service and atmosphere was great too!",
        "I've had better experiences at other churrascarias. the pork tenderloin and ham-and-pineapple selections were the only highlights.",
        "A very nice sports bar.  Great place to watch a game or just hang out.  They have awesome TV's.  My boyfriend is in love with their nachos because they use fresh jalapenos, which makes them pretty spicy.  I'm very excited to have such a nice sports bar so close to home.",
        "Third time here and each time it is a great experience.  Atmosphere  is fun and relaxing.  A must for a girls pamper day.  Pedicures and gel manicures are amazing and last for weeks.",
        "We came into Las Vegas from Phoenix and found this gem of a store. They were very well stocked with games for anyone's taste and the staff was extremely knowledgeable about their stock and the game industry.",
        "Not just coffee, but don't forget the tea!  Great loose leaf blends and knowledgeable staff to coach on steeping times and the varieties.  They could even cite the amount of caffeine in each. Very impressive.... cannot wait to try the coffee.",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",
        "This was the 2nd place we went to try and sell old gold pieces we no longer wear. What a difference in knowledge and costumer service we received going here. The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",
        "yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too.",
        "Was here a couple of weeks ago for a Gammage Goers event. Love this cute little place right on Mill Avenue! The bruschetta was tasty and a good price for the quantity! The service was really slow (we waited around 15 minutes for the check), I think because it was St. Patrick's Day she was a bit overwhelmed, but I definitely want to go back to try more items. Especially their Sangria. ;)",
        "I was visiting a friend and stopped in for a mani/pedi. For $40 I expect at least some effort put into my nails and a manicure to last the week. The girl that worked on me barely scrubbed my feet, pretended to push my cuticles back and my fingernails were chipping 2 days later. Next time I'll go to the CVS across the street, buy polish and do them myself! What a waste of money.",
        "I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back.",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.",
        "Kouign-amann. Check.\\nCanel\\u00e9. Check.\\nPeet's Coffee. Check.\\nCroque Madame? Oh yeah.\\nPain au chocolat. The bomb!\\n\\nNow Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery has a contender on the west. Worth the drive!",
        "Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better.",
        "The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat.",
        "Great selection, friendly and knowledgeable staff.  One of the most reliable Vape stores in the valley with multiple locations!",
        "While the pizza was most definitely delicious, the process of trying to order cheeseless pizza was so clunky that even though the cashier and the manager confirmed the order, the cook still put mozzarella on it. Still four stars, however, since once this was brought to their attention they gave us another pizza, free of charge.\\n\\nIt was also very clean and had some awesome menu choices. Definitely planning on eating there again.",
        "Disagree with post from 12/23\\n\\nThis place is the closest to authentic you can find. The mole sauce is excellent and the patio in the warm weather is a great place to chill on a nice night. BYOB or go across the street pick up a sixer or two.\\n\\nThey will keep your beer cold for you, bring some wine and they will also mix up some sangria for ya!!",
        "Wow!  Happy hour wings are the best!  Nachos portion is huge and great price for what you get.  You may need to keep on your server cause it's a little hectic in there but happy hour is the way to go here... My kids love the lazer tag and video games!  Not bad for little Surprise ;)\\n\\nDon't expect the waitresses to be quick.  Ours was very slow.",
        "Small portions and almost an hour wait, decor was nice but seating was very tight. The potatoes were amazing, everything else was average, wished the sizes were bigger. Walked across the street to fairmount bagel because we were still hungry afterwards. They were also selling fairmount bagels but for $2 instead of $1 originally. Don't think I would wait to try this place again",
        "Went in there on a Sunday with four people working and two other clients in there only. Asked for a pedi and gel manicure, they had me soaking in cold water for 30 minutes without them checking on me or notifying me of a wait before I just left.",
        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "If you go here, sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh! We came here for drinks but the food looked good. Wednesday is their $1 beer special and $5.50 martini night. The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10.",
        "Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare.",
        "Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process. When their original diagnosis was wrong they went to option b and didn't charge me for the unneeded replacement. They usually very busy, but we'll worth any wait.",
        "We went to Mirage's buffet for dinner last night. It was very disappointing compared to Bellagio we went the night before.  They had a poor variety of foods.  The  broth of the Asian wonton noodle soups was so plain and tasteless. No sashimi, only some sushi rolls.  Dessert selection was so poor.  Fruits were all diced up in small pieces. The price was $24.95 + tax= $26.95.  Will not come back.",
        "This was my second time at California Pizza in LV Mirage. My first time was as disappointing as the second time. I only when the second time because my friend insisted on having pizza. The pizza is just not good overall., maybe I am a bit more demanding when it comes to pizza than others but this pizza really did not qualify as good pizza in my books. Not to mention your bill for two pizzas and a soda will run you over $40.",
        "Really satisfied with the manner in which Jeremy and team take care of our 3/4 acre yard. Prompt, thorough, knowledgeable, dependable, good communicator. We are very pleased.",
        "I just bought a house and needed my doors re-locked.  Called around 9:30 and Toby was there by 1:00pm.  He was courteous, professional and knowledgeable.  Would definitely recommend him to anyone needing a great locksmith.\\nThanks!",
        "Joining CrossFit Infinite Strength has undoubtedly been one of the best decisions I have made to improve my overall well-being.

        "What can I say? I love lazy rivers. Even though  there is probably a huge percentage of alcohol and pee, it's still fun. It's like adults on a hamster wheel drunk. If you get sick of the hamster wheel try the nachos, they are huge and the yummiest pool side snack they offer.",
        "Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising.",
        "Great Service on the Patio. quick, knowledgeable, friendly..\\nFantastic Empanadas, Chili Rellano, Sangria..\\nHave been several times and enjoyed this location very much.\\n\\nOnly negative is consistency, slight, seasoning has not been consistent..\\nNot enough to keep me from coming back.. great afterwork spot.",
        "Forget this is Bobby Flay's restaruant -- it's great! Our large 13 person party enjoyed a 3-hour lunch, simply decadent and never feeling rushed. Although the food was spectacular, our server was the highlight of the meal. She was very knowledgeable and involved, selecting excellent Spanish wines to pair with the food and offering suggestions for dessert and side dishes.",
        "Went there yesterday for lunch. Wanted to sit outside however there were so many flies. Not appealing while eating. Also, we then decided to get it to go and we never received our order of fries after we did pay for them. Realized after we got home. Bacon was also really fatty on chicken club. Poppers and mozzarella sticks were good though.  Do not order a salad, they're cheap on the lettuce!",
        "This place obviously changed their hours and didn't update anything else except the door on their business. Last time I came by, they were closed randomly. Ok, I understand things happen and it's necessary. No problem. However, now they are closed on Sundays and didn't bother to update their answering service or information online. Annoying.",
        "Definition of a roach motel with cockroaches working behind the front desk. I say its a waste of money remodeling \\\"the quad\\\" \\\"the linq\\\", \\\"imperial palace\\\", whatever Ceasers is calling it now-a-days. I say save the money and level it. This place is disgusting and stinks! Worse than the worst motel 6 on the planet! Employees are such jerks too.",
        "Love this place!! Great bagels! Great service! Turkey bacon club with swiss on a bagel is the best clubs I've ever had and I worked at a sandwich place before. I can't want to go back again and eat more yummy food.",
        "Good biscuit but I like the chorizo burrito my boyfriend ordered better. It had more flavor and \\\"kick to it\\\". Staff was friendly and I enjoyed sitting out in the patio. Nice place to have brunch.",
        "Got to give props to any pub that serves Monster Munch, Quavers, Pringles and Doriotos behind the bar.\\nWas up for a few days as a massively gaggle of psychiatrists and mental health nurses - got nothing but a warm, friendly welcome, reasonably priced beers and a fantastic savoury snack selection from here.\\nWould come back again, and again, and again... no problem",
        "Decent prices.  $21 for 2 huge sandwiches.  felt like boa constrictors as we left.  Reuben sandwich was good on terrific rye.  Fries excellent!  Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella.",
        "I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me.",
        "Service still pretty inattentive the second time around, but I sat where I could look into the kitchen and watch them make my pizza. The ingredients look fresh, including the chunks of mozzarella (as opposed to shredded). Not really my favorite style of pizza, as I like a little more cheese and sauce, but not bad. It's the only restaurant for gates C1-C9, so hey what are you gonna do?",
        "We have family in Louisiana, so we know great Cajun cooking.  The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent.  The cost of a glass of house wine was $13.00 and whoever heard of a martini glass too small to hold three olives for $12.00?  The bar prices need to get a reality check.",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "A nice afternoon break sitting outside on a busy Saturday.   Wait staff was very good.  Enjoyed a refreshing bloody mary and my companion had sangria.  Good taste and value.   Had the soft tacos.  Carnitas were very tender.   Lamb was good, not great.   Salsas sampler and chips were good.  Not too heavy.   Enjoyable time.  Will definitely be back."

        "The front office supervisor is incredibly rude. Sad that my mom went to this office for years and this is how I am treated. Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous.",
        "Terrible in every way, worse place I have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive.  This must be a front to launder money because I don't know how else they stay in business.",
        "By far, the friendliest Chipotle I've been to. Awesome staff, above and beyond service. Thank you guys for being so awesome here!",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back.",
        "Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.",

        "Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there.",
        "The Linq is a \\\"mini strip\\\" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",
        "Very low quality room off the strip. If your looking to stay at a party hotel with people passed out in the hall  ways and benches out front this is your place. We stayed at the place and it was terrible and the room was half way cleaned checking in.",
        "Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.",
        "You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\\n\\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \\n\\nI will NEVER be back.",
        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "I enjoyed this intimate little spot. I had a drink names \\\"Gods Gift\\\" and it was delish! The atmosphere is wonderful and I can see myself going here with friends just to chill out and enjoy some laughs. The drinks are affordable for what you get! I've had crappier drinks that were twice as much.",
        "Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "Great food and service.  Currently the best steak I've ever had, twice!  They are  consistent for sure!",
        "Unlike the previous review, I've ate here. 4-5 times, and each time I've had EXCELLENT food and service. Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place.",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",
        "Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills",
        "In the past I really enjoyed Great Steak, even though it's not a legit cheesesteak they usually tide me over. However, this particular location was terrible, one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Won't be back. EVER.",
        "Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly.",
        "A Charlotte staple in need of a makeover. Generally solid food but sometimes inconsistent - biggest challenge is the atmosphere which is stale and hasn't kept up with the rest of the Charlotte restaurant scene. You can't go wrong by a visit to PC - especially if the weather is nice and you get to sit on the excellent patio. Salads are great here.",
        "I called Chris to repair dog damage to my carpets based solely off the reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed.  He was every bit as professional and capable as the previous reviews stated.  He made sure to call when he was on his way and showed up when he said he would and was much more reasonably priced than other services I had called.  He took his time and did a phenomenal job with 2 repairs in my home. I would call him again in a second.",
        "I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.",
        "This is a horrible car wash.  The manager / owner is extremely rude and the quality of the work is terrible.   I would never waste the money to return here.  They only are concerned with up selling detail packages and not with the quality of car washes done.",
        "Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "I went in and asked if I could get my computer that was repaired. The employee responded with, \\\"I don't know, can you?\\\"\\n\\nHis response was rude  and very uncomfortable. He then made me wait for 25 minutes as he continued to just stand around. \\n\\nOnce again, terrible experience. Do NOT go to this store.",
        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",
        "I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame. \\n\\nI could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!",
        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "We just left and let me tell you, atmosphere was not good. Mainly caused by other patrons; in particular a group of women who were extremely loud and one who cackles.  We moved to the back of the restaurant to escape but the sound carried...  Food was above average, so we'll give it another try. Surf n turf roll was a little salty. I hope the ladies stick to joints were you might bring a colicky baby -- those with inherent background noise.",
        "Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved! So gross! Never will I stay here again!! The manager of the hotel didn't even take time to contact me and fix this issue terrible terrible costumer service.",
        "I was looking for a chair rental company for our upcoming wedding and contacted RSVP. Our wedding venue coordinator also mentioned that she has worked with them in the past, so I decided to give them a call. I spoke with Lorraine today, and in the span of about 20 minutes she quoted me with a very reasonable price, and has already sent over the contract. I could not be happier with her service, and this is one less thing I need to worry about.",
        "My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!",
        "Terrible! Absolutely terrible! I know good sushi and this was not anywhere close. \\n\\nI don't usually write reviews but this was so bad I felt compelled to warn everyone. I went to this place because I had a groupon but I honestly wouldn't go back if the food was free.\\n\\nYou have been warned.",
        "Terrible meal, terrible waitress. Nothing good to say about this place. Waitress dumped drink in my lap, forgot 1 out of 4 meals. Would never tell anyone about this place.",

        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.

        "It was about a 2 1/2 hour class for the adult/child/infant CPR/AED certification. John did an excellent job teaching the class. It was very informative. It was only $40. I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much.",
        "Been here twice and both times have been good.",
        "My previous review was very harsh, but true.  I met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect.  I have had nothing but poor service previously, but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter.  So, I'm upping the stars, hopefully the service keeps improving.",
        "This Johnny Rockets is better than the rest.  Even other Johnny Rockets.  Customer Service went above and beyond what we expected.  The Manager was extremely helpful.  They did nothing wrong, but acted like they did.  We would definitely return.  Food was excellent.  Shakes were great!",
        "I went here only because we had a 90% off Restaurant.com Coupon and I'm glad I didn't actually pay full price. The food was so mediocre that I determined that they don't put much effort into the food because they assume that the people eating here are already so wasted that they won't notice. Not a fan...",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter.

        "Disappointed because I wanted to send a gift to my Mother and Grandmother for Mother's Day.  Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need.",

        "The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table.  I do have to say that i didnt like the food.  I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste/look like.\\n\\nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them.",
        "4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.",

The manager is awesome, the staff is so helpful, if they don't know the answer to something they will go above and beyond to make sure they find it for you!! We went to another Kohl's and it just reassured us to always come back to this one!!!",
        "Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.",
        "Seriously, no idea how anyone could give a good review for this awful restaurant. Agreed on the nice setting. But the food is terrible. And really overpriced! It's always empty...for good reason. I make better fajitas than this place (and so does TGIF) but they charge $22 for them...and sour cream is extra. Food cannot be less authentic. No clue about Mexican food at all. Save yourself the bother.",
        "Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous.",
        "Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.",

        "My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",
        "Terrible. Tried the bulgogi sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a mocha frap - none of it was good and it was as expensive as the awesome deli dinner I has the night before.",
        "Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.",
        "middle of the road.  I'd give it 2.5 stars.  the shrimp fried rice was very good, the teriyaki chicken good, the orange chicken pretty blech.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say it was decent.  Not great, not good, but not terrible.  Just average.",
        "Today I was looking for a new phone.  Getting a new phone and plan is already a headache as there are so many hidden fees in plans.

Nice private outdoor, shaded, seating as well. Good overall, but three stars for an previous issue with some spoiled gelato.",
        "I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.\\n\\nPoor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.",
        "Table of 4, wait was 20++ minutes late on a Thursday night.   No bar to wait in, plus no alert system (buzzer or whatever) so we couldn't wander around the casino.   Once we were seated, the food was great.....  Just burgers but lots of toppings, etc.   Nothing bad nor was it overly memorable.  Very sufficient for a bite in Harrahs!",
        "Terrible! The food is terrible. Like really terrible. Everything tastes like fish.  How do you manage to make a chicken quesadilla taste like fish?  That shouldn't even be possible.\\nService was so slow.  Took forever to get a menu, order, and get food.\\nAnd it's fucking cold in there. I didn't come to the desert to have rock hard nipples from how cold I am.",

Truly the worst Hot & Sour Soup and Mongolian Beef I have ever tasted, in fact I could only eat a tiny portion of each.  Steve Wynn should be ashamed of himself!",
        "Food is overpriced. Service is awful. They give you two tiny pieces of bread with a sizeable appetizer, but when you ask for more bread, they act like you're robbing them. They are all incredibly rude, including the chef. Terrible ambiance, no music. Trying to be New York. Waste of time, head to Herb Box, right around the corner.",

They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",

If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",

        "Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.",
        "Salsa verde, cilantro, pork crackling. You can't ask for anything better. Surprisingly dioecious authentic Mexican food. Excellent drink and food selection. Having grown up on Mexican food, this is certainly up to standard. Good ambiance, too.",
        "I've been to the Tussaud's in London, in Hollywood, and love the one in Vegas, although they have many of the same figures in all three (that's the economy of scale you get having multiple locations, I guess).  Fun to take pics of you and the celebrities and get right up and see them up close and personal.",
        "Un service chaleureux, un couscous g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reux, des dattes aux amendes savoureuses pour accompagner un excellent th\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la menthe. Le coin berb\\u00e8re est un must!",
        "RUDE,RUDE,RUDE is all I can say about this place. If you want to be treated like dirt, this is the place for you. I went in there ro shop and rexeived the worst customer service I have ever receives anywhere. Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "Haha, just stood there behind another guy for ten minutes with No type of worker presence, he ate a bag of chips and we mobbed it to silver mine..if you can't be open 24hrs you should at least lock your doors..lol",
        "Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.",
        "Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors.\\nDinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size.\\nSave room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce.",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "Have only had 1 massage here.  It was ok; felt more like a sports massage (with stretching involved) than a relaxing one.  I prefer the atmosphere and massage techniques at Dolce.  I do frequent this place for brow waxing, even though they did burn me once.  Cute place though.",
        "So this place was packed when we got here, so we opted just to get a pastry to go.  We had the chaussons aux pommes, mmmm good.  The apple was a little tart and not too sweet.  The pastry shell itself was delicious, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We wish we were able to fully enjoy what this place had to offer after having the pastry we wanted more! Definitely worth checking out!",
        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",
        "Oh No!!!! \\nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much.\\nWould not go here again......bye bye bob\\nFor that price go to charcoal room",
        "Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?",
        "Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!",
        "If you want a great, gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road. They are cheaper and she's an accomplished pastry chef. The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all.",
        "Was super impressed with the fish tacos. Same taste and fell as cali. Also the 3 rolled tacos were amazing as well. Service was good, friendly staff and love option of having beer. Didn't like the bar being separated from dinner room. All in all great food, and great healthy choices.",
        "All of the various cancer charities run by the Reynolds family are SCAMS. They pay themselves a fortune and give $0.02 for each dollar raised to people suffering from cancer. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",
        "Food is good but make sure to ask for easy sauce. All their dishes come with globs of sauce that is at the bottom of the bowl. There is no other rice bowl places is this area besides YC's. Gave 3 star because like YC's better and food comes with too much sauce. Will return but won't venture far into their menu besides ordering the teriyaki chicken bowl.",
        "Great brunch!!  I had a lobster omelette.  We were in a rush and they got our orders out very quickly and were extremely nice.  Will definitely go here again when I'm in the area.",
        "Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",
        "Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.",
        "middle of the road.  I'd give it 2.5 stars.  the shrimp fried rice was very good, the teriyaki chicken good, the orange chicken pretty blech.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say it was decent.  Not great, not good, but not terrible.  Just average.",
        "The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !",
        "Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!",
        "Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.",
        "This place is very small but packs a huge flavorful punch to your taste buds! Made me an instant fan! I had the #1 carne machado, beef empanada & the coconut with cheese pastelito. I also tried the guava & cheese pastelito, that thing was amazing! I loved every morsel of all the good food I was able to try.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "We choose this hotel based on price and location  \\nThe continental breakfast was good\\nNothing fancy  just a place to sleep\\nThere was free wi fi",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.",
        "Forget the tablecloth-and-white-glove joints. I walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu, but was even more impressed with the healthy options available. I had an omelet and wheat toast, and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm - and I'm not a small guy.",
        "It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.",
        "Had a nice breakfast, I tried the Mexican Omelette and it was very good. I recommend getting the salsa on the side as my omelette had a lot of salsa on it. They had fresh squeezed lemonade which was really good as well. If you need to get some breakfast this place was great since it's in a nice location.",
        "Visiting from Cali...this place was clean, staff was friendly & intuitive.  Reasonably priced, easy to find.",
        "Pretty solid Korean food imo. Ordered the Gamjatang (meat was tender, broth was flavourful) and bibimbap (this also came with a soup which was nice!).\\n\\nWould recommend this place for a good Korean meal in Waterloo :)",
        "I really wanted to like this place but the portion sizes was tiny. I had there bento box with Chicken Teriyaki but there was more vegetables then chicken. It should have been called  Vegetables Teriyaki. Too much money for too little food. After dinner I went out to get another meal to satisfy my less than full stomach!",
        "This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "My wife and I had breakfast here while staying at the Wigwam. The coffee was great. We both ordered omelets which were good sized and packed with ingredients. Very tasty and a good atmosphere.",
        "RESTAURANT INFLEXIBLE. Reserved table for wine pairing dinner months in advance with the understanding that one of the party didn't eat meat. \\nTwo days before the dinner we were sent a menu which contained no options other than meat. The chef refused to alter her menu to add a non-meat option. \\nChef too self-important to accommodate clientele.",
        "Pie in the Sky's pizza is way better than Fuel's, hands down. I would absolutely recommend this place, especially if you need to order for an inexpensive business lunch. I have never been dissappointed! My favorite pizzas are the Supreme and the BBQ Chicken, but they are all good. Also, get the Greek salad. They don't skimp on toppings and the dressing is great. Love this place.",
        "Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?",
        "Have been here several times and so far, only one dish was OK: the pasta dish under Health Conscious. All the other dishes have been disappointing, including the Fruit Crepes which I had today, the omelette which was overcooked, the pancakes which have been tasteless. For breakfast, I would be better off going to IHOP.",
        "Amazing guacamole!! The food is wonderful! Great service too! Go on Restaurant.com to get your $$ off! We used a $50 off of $100 and ended up spending around $75 for four adults to drink and enjoy an AMAZING meal!",
        "Basically my favorite \\\"creative\\\" Mexican food spot. Hands down, best guacamole in town. Get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds. The low rider margarita is awesome. Also, their signature pork dish is pretty tasty.",
        "We now have a favorite mechanic shop!  Had an oil pressure problem in our truck, took it to them and they even found the exhaust leak problem which we knew we had, but Midway Chevrolet and another mechanic said we didn't have!\\n\\nI love Jeff and the guys at Curt's.  They are an honest group and they have not made me feel as if they are out to nickel and dime us.  \\n\\nGreat place!",
        "Yelp and Good Fellas  really came through for my family and I while we were off the beaten path looking for some good grub.  Good Fellas is very very good food.  They have a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is just about the food.  Try the two meat combo.  MMMMMM!  The lentil soup is excellant (try it with some lemon juice).  The only thing I did not like about the place is it is not in the east valley!",
        "Not what I expected!  This place is a Pittsburgh institution.  I expected mahogany and brass, but walked into a tiny diner.\\n\\nVery friendly.  The fish is awesome.  The huge Calimari rings are absurdly tender.  No gumminess at all.  \\n\\nThe place is crazy at lunch time, so I never even attempted it until now.  Worked late and still a decent crowd.",
        "Supremely sticky floors. I sat on a bar stool and leaped over the puddles to avoid ruining my shoes.\\n\\nAccidentally mistook my friend Jason from far away and when I said, \\\"hey Jason,\\\" this shady dude said, \\\"I'm not Jason, but I'll certainly be him.\\\" Eeew.",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "Kouign-amann. Check.\\nCanel\\u00e9. Check.\\nPeet's Coffee. Check.\\nCroque Madame? Oh yeah.\\nPain au chocolat. The bomb!\\n\\nNow Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery has a contender on the west. Worth the drive!",
        "Oh boy was I pleasantly surprised by this delicious place. Always stop by Starbucks and this time I decided to try it and oh boy was I missing it! It is just simply delicious their egg drop soup is phenomenal their teriyaki chicken out of this world! Would decently recommend it!",
        "I am not sure if I went on an off day or what.  My omelet was less than mediocre.  My in-laws had sandwiches that came in regular sliced white sandwich bread, yuck! My husband had another omelet and he didn't finished his either.  My friend keeps asking me to go there with her, but I am too traumatized.",
        "The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat.",
        "There's not much to be said about the pizza here except that it is comparatively cheap, quick, and is no frills. Whether you're tired of overpaying for things on the strip or want to get late night grub without a reservation, this is your place. Free water and condiments, and you get to tease everyone at the Cosmopolitan with your cheap yet filling pizza. Can't go wrong.",
        "Loved the family atmosphere and home cooked food.  The owners moved from NY to Las Vegas years ago and brought their yummy Italian recipes with them.  The lasagna, pizza, and pre-packaged tiramisu were great.  Only a short drive from the strip and well worth the cheaper home cooked food.",
        "I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price.",
        "One of the worst buffets in Las Vegas, period.  Very poor selection of food and of those available, marginal quality.  Stay away and go to Wynn - more expensive but definately worth it.  Even our waitress said not to drink the cheap campagne - it's low quality and will give you a bad headache.\\nHave been to many LV buffets and this ranks as the lowest of all.",
        "Clean inside with pretty decor.  Never busy with great service.  \\n\\nThe Tableside Guacamole is devine.  Yummmm......\\nThe Margarita Cheesecake is a straight up hangover cure.\\nThe Cancun sauce is unique and delicioso!\\n\\nNot the best mexican food I've ever had, but it has a small soft spot in my heart.",
        "We went for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning, about 9 am. Food was delivered fast and hot. Omelette was big as the plate. Homemade jam for toast and the cinnamon role was divine!!!! Service was excellent!",
        "Crab omelet? More like imitation crab meat which is really just a mix of various extra fish parts, processed and flavored like crab. When will restaurants be honest about what they serve? Its just sad.",
        "Oh my lord no! The dancers here sure are skinny! In truth, the clientele do seem to be having a good time.",
        "Best donuts in the world.  I have not traveled the world but I'm pretty sure I'm right.  Plus they DO have free wifi so why go to another place for mediocre donuts.  If I'm gonna eat those kinds of calories I want each one to be delicious.",
        "The best quick teriyaki bowls that I've had in the area. I always order ahead so I don't have t",
        "Service was great.  \\n\\nAtmosphere was great.  \\n\\nSide Caesar Salad and bread were great.  \\n\\nMy side (rigatoni and sauce) was good.  \\n\\nMain course, chicken parm looked great, but the chicken tasted and had the texture of something that came frozen and in a bag.  Was disappointing!!!\\n\\nMy fianc\\u00e9 loved her chicken piccata.",
        "Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!",
        "I visited this place today for the first time in 15 years.  I have to say:  they still have all of those amazing recipes and flavors.  Now that I'm back in town it will certainly be a restaurant that I visit frequently.  Seriously tasty food!",
        "Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest.",
        "The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision.",
        "Love this place!! Great bagels! Great service! Turkey bacon club with swiss on a bagel is the best clubs I've ever had and I worked at a sandwich place before. I can't want to go back again and eat more yummy food.",
        "I have been wanting to try City Tavern for a while now. I feel as if I should have tried them years ago. It almost seems as if the restaurant may be cutting corners. The food is subpar. Most of what I had was previously frozen. My egg roll was cold in the middle and the calamari was incredibly chewy. My \\\"sushi grade\\\" tuna was pink, not red. It was basically over priced bar fare.",
        "One Of my favorite bars in Pgh:) they have a wide variety of beers on tap and there is always specials running everyday of the week... Appetizers are delicious, burgers are well stacked and sum pretty yummy wings! you can buy the sacuses for the wings which is amazing!! I recomend the teriyaki or the honey BBQ wings!",
        "Not nearly as good as chipotle. The vegetables were not fresh, salsa was mediocre. Guacamole was blackened due to age, lousy iced tea . Big disappointment.",

Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated",

Now however I feel the place is a great addition to the Old Town mix. Great bartenders good diverse crowd from 21 to 80 . This is what a real pub should be like. If you don't like the pasty choices try the pasta salad with chicken. So happy to see no TVs .",
        "Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there.",

        "5 stars for sure!, this place has the best 'char siew' in town.  It's lean and just enough sauce without drowning it like most other places make the mistake of doing.",
        "Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere.",
        "dissapoint on pricing, food didnt satisfy the spot,.2.star.for friendly staff",
        "Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead.",
        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "I've been here twice (because after my first time I didn't want to go back but decided to give it another try). Both times they were slow behind the counter (trying to be like a Chipotle) and the food was just not enjoyable at all. Would rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba.",
        "Pros: Clean basic rooms (the adjacent door was convenient), free WIFI, good location on the strip - especially good since it was right where the finish line for the Rock N Roll Half Marathon! Woot. \\n\\nCons: Wasn't the biggest fan of the lobby...found it a bit dimly lit, not lively, and didn't put me in the best mood.",
        "Way too crowded for it's small size. Have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies. The only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in. The place looks nice but I'm not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me.",
        "1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",
        "Really wanted to like this place :( 3 stars just for the fried yuca. The meat in my arepa tasted like steamed dog food, had a really gamey flavor. We literally took the rest of our arepas home and gave it to our dog",
        "We had Lunch there on a Sunday ,pretty busy .\\nI say the food is ok not a wow but ok.\\nThe service was good and the place looked pretty clean .\\nThey got lots to pick from. \\nWe did wait a long time for are food.\\nThe prices are not to bad either .\\nI will give them another try maybe for dinner.",
        "Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \\\"all-you-can eat\\\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "Great sushi and service.  The 5th star just being held back because of the high prices.  Incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",
        "Awesome in the single word! Affordable in the second word! Easy to find out whatever you need  gifting shop also can be said. Actually I love books and also this store like due to the service I have taken from them. Taken different types of books mentioned good.",

        "The Linq is a \\\"mini strip\\\" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",
        "Atmosphere is lovely, and most of the time the staff is awesome. If you like strong coffee, be sure to specify so they make it strong! :)\\n\\nPrices are good. Best hummus I've had in a long time.\\n\\nChocolate chip cookie was delicious,.\\n\\nToxic shake is to die for! Amazing.",
        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",
        "Food was very good, waiter (Chris) provided excellent service.  They did sit us on temporary chairs (by the kitchen too) though.\\n\\nNot much use even posting this because they are closing soon.",
        "Two friends and I visited Blue Sky today for the first time.  We all had mani/pedis and it was sheer heaven for all three of us!!  The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!",
        "You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\\n\\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \\n\\nI will NEVER be back.",
        "This place is amazing !!!! If you live in vegas you gotta come here at least once it is so cool and amazing. Great service and great food.",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",
        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",
        "I've seen holiday inns better than this.  It's filthy. Stained carpets, stuff sitting out in the hallways. Market doors, peeling paint, you can smell dust and mold.  Waited in SPG line for over 20 minutes to check in. Ridiculous. Got to room and change immediately. Wifi was horrible as well. There is not one good thing about this hotel. I'm here for business and its been a long time since I've seen something this bad.",

        "Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.",
        "This company was supposed to send an academic book to my brother. After failing to do so, we drove to the branch in Phoenix where a staff member complained about how she was supposed to off the clock! \\n\\nWe waited so long for the package once we got there. How unprofessional.",
        "Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!",
        "Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge.",
        "Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!",
        "Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.",
        "I enjoyed this intimate little spot. I had a drink names \\\"Gods Gift\\\" and it was delish! The atmosphere is wonderful and I can see myself going here with friends just to chill out and enjoy some laughs. The drinks are affordable for what you get! I've had crappier drinks that were twice as much.",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",
        "Went again, this time for dinner.  I still say it's not worth it for the price, even more so now after I've been to the Studio B buffet. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-b-buffet-henderson)\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving it another star is because that creme brulee is out of this world. And maybe I didn't hate their meat as much this time.",
        "Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \\n\\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!",
        "A foodie friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant and it was very good. Why not 5 stars? Because I reserve those for the very best. Still, this was very, very good. Very imaginative and tasty. I had a goat dish of mutli parts and the flavors were wonderful. So was the service. Check it out, you wan't be disappointed.",
        "The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25",
        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.",
        "I had a so-so experience at AZ on the Rocks my first visit but due to the absolutely wonderful follow up and customer service I have received since then I am definitely amending my original review. The owner really went out of his way to make sure that my next visit is much better. As soon as my schedule allows I will be heading back to check it out for the second time.",
        "Always interesting things to see at Musee des Beaux Arts de Montreal. 2 huge pavilions spanning Sherbrooke St. with a variety of art (and art forms) for all tastes. \\n\\nThe problem is that IT IS NO LONGER FREE to access the permanent collection, unless you're under 30 years old. Bizarre. Those of us who are born too long ago have to pay to get in now. Be sure to check the site before going.. Recent change.",
        "One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!",
        "First time. Staff is nice. Typical bar and typical Charlotte food aka crap. But if you were born in the south you may like it. North people stay away",
        "What a fun trip down memory lane! I loved seeing some of the old pinball machines (and a TRON video game! Holy crap!), and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood. Everyone should go here and visit at least once.",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger.\\nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips.\\nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.\\n\\nThis was worth trying once.",
        "Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .",
        "Dear Lord. We've been sitting here 45 minutes and got 1 drink and still no food. IT'S SATURDAY. And it's EMPTY.  We are only staying to see how long it takes at this point. Completely horrible experience. I may not stay at the hotel again I'm so upset.",
        "Calm down, people. \\n\\nIt's pricey and pretty average. Go somewhere else if you can, but go if you have to, because it'll hit the spot if you want it enough.  #Firstworldproblems",
        "Been visiting this location for years. The staff is always friendly, the store is almost always in order and things are easy to find. Never had a single problem here. Love them.",
        "The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.",
        "Food took forever.\\nPeople working there just seemed annoyed that people were there. Waitress making annoyed sounds and gestures to people behind their back. No good.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "#dirties - this was an ugly experience.  I got lotto and fuel and left as soon as possible lol.",
        "Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment.",
        "Best hot and sour soup I've ever had!\\n\\nTake out! It's a hole in the wall. Family owned and ran, great people! I've been going here since a kid service and quality are consistent! Make sure you call in your order takes forever but that's how you know it's fresh!",
        "Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone.\\nNice to have Arcadia Farms there too.",
        "It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!"

Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",

The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",

We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender.

        "This places food is so delicious I seriously love their cheesesteaks, what telly brings them down is there service. The people working there show no customer service skills what so ever, they would rather stand around and gossip than assit a paying customer. But the food...is a 5/5 in my book only reason I keep coming back.",
        "Elements is a gift shop in Aria that sells cigarettes , snacks and some interesting , random gifts and suveniors . They had blackjack strategy cards for $2 which was kinda random but nice . The snacks and beverages at this store might be kind of overpriced just like everything else in Vegas but the great thing about this store is that they're open 24 hours .",
        "yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too.",

        "I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back.",
        "I had pants hemmed here and, while the guy did a decent job (though they still ended up too long even though he pinned them while I had them on?) it was absurdly expensive and took A WEEK.  \\n\\nCome on now.",

        "Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better.",
        "Friday Happy hour menu:\\nSteak and cheese - $ 6, decent\\nNeopolitan milkshake - $4, decent\\nGyro - $6, no more next time\\nPanini - $6, okay\\n\\nService is slow, despite it being almost empty.\\n\\nOverall, it's okay if you are starving, hungover, drunk, or didn't think of other options.",
        "This was a fantastic experience.!    Eric Schultz was a great host.  The beef carpachio was excellent.   The service was as good as the food.   Family owned and operated.   We had a 6 course meal for two on our anniversary and the cost before tip was 140.",
        "I was excited that a new casino the SLS had opened in Vegas.  And a new club. LIfe.  I was so unimpressed and disappointed by the club. Life is a total waste of time and money. Horrible service, rude staff  overpriced beyond rheir north strip ghetto local.  Do not waste your time. Lame",
        "Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends.",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "We stopped in for breakfast and found the restaurant to be fairly empty.  They were pushing their \\\"specials\\\" pretty hard, and while they looked good, I choose to stick with something else.  \\n\\nIt did appear as if we might have been a little forgotten about, but the server was very pleasant and apologized.  \\n\\nOverall it was a very nice experience with good portions and good food.",
        "I love their sandwiches but they are VERY over priced AND.... they do not have whole wheat bread.  They were definitely behind the times by not having a whole wheat bread instead of WHITE bread.  Every other sandwich place I know has whole wheat..  Fire House Subs, subway, port of subs, quiznos. etc..\\n\\nCome on Capriotti's get some damm whole wheat french bread.",
        "OMG, great burgers! I fell onto this place, after shopping in the mall area.  I ordered the Phoenix and my daughter the Portabello Mushroom. Both were delicious, although I favored mine (with the jalapenos). Didn't care for the skinny fries with sea salt, as they had very little flavor and were dried out.",
        "Happy hour prices pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips kind of salty. Our server was Olivia who made a pretty good Long Island iced tea but wasn't as attentive as Racquel was the last time we were in. Still overall we love the food here, usually good.",
        "Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as \\\"Chicago Style\\\" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.\\n\\nTheir sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive.",
        "McKoys is great !!! My coworkers and myself rarely miss a Thursday night there. We love the 50 cent wings but everything else is fantastic too. Great  food, great atmosphere, fantastic wait staff, sometimes the only problem is finding a parking space!!",
        "The lamb short ribs- WOW!!!! We are sad they are only a special - we considered getting some to go. One of the best plates I've had in a while. This place continues to awe us. We love getting a handful of dishes and sharing them. FnB transforms vegetables into amazing things! And you must try the butterscotch pudding for dessert- another WOW!!! FnB is one of the best places to eat in scottsdale!",
        "What can I say? I love lazy rivers. Even though  there is probably a huge percentage of alcohol and pee, it's still fun. It's like adults on a hamster wheel drunk. If you get sick of the hamster wheel try the nachos, they are huge and the yummiest pool side snack they offer.",

Crunch roll and the mackerel were my favorite the seaweed salad is good too but you can't mess that one up. The box meals are pretty standard. \\nThe sashimi is good quality and good size portions the best was the salmon hand roll",
        "One Of my favorite bars in Pgh:) they have a wide variety of beers on tap and there is always specials running everyday of the week... Appetizers are delicious, burgers are well stacked and sum pretty yummy wings! you can buy the sacuses for the wings which is amazing!! I recomend the teriyaki or the honey BBQ wings!",
        "Went here earlier tonight with my dad, we're in Scotland on holiday for a few days.  He had the leg of lamb, I had the seared tuna steak.  A delicious dinner (and a few rounds of drinks) at a reasonable price.  Waitstaff was friendly and pleasantly talkative.  I will go again when I am able and am already singing this restaurant's praises to my friends.",
        "I love this show.  It was the most amazing show I have ever seen.\\n\\nThe only slight problem is that now I compare every show I see to this show and always end up thinking 'it wasn't as good as Mystere'.  Like nothing can come close.",
        "Stacy's Smokehouse came recomended and it lived up to thier words.  Nicole at the front was friendly and helpful with making the correct choices...go big, because you'll come back for more if you don't.  The onion rings and bbq pork sandwich were delicous and I'll be looking to come back again soon.",
        "Very unimpressed. I expected alot more based on all the hype.  All the fries that came to our table were cold and soggy. My chicken sandwich was cold as well, and the chicken was VERY bland!  Both the Sprite and the Ketchup were amazing though!  I hope they can get it together.  DTLV needs some decent places to eat. Good luck.  Service was acceptable.",

        "I loved this place. The food was amazing and the portions were perfect. The ambiance was good and the service impeccable. I would highly recomend this place to any of my friends or family. It is pricey though so make sure you're ready to shell out the dough or your corporate credit card.",
        "I was suprised how much I liked Kahunaville. Sandwiches are all very reasonably priced- around 11 bucks- and very large. The drinks are spendy like most of Vegas but be nice and they pour stiff. I highly recommend a Bombay and tonic yard. \\n\\nOur server was very friendly and professional, She did a great job especially since one of my group pulled a rude dipshit maneuver with an empty ketchup bottle.",
        "I can't, for the life of me, remember the Barista who assisted me, but she was HILARIOUS and fun!  I would come back just for her customer service.  She was a little short blondie.  \\n\\nThe customer service was great.  It is located near a frozen yogurt place as well. Win!  Win!",
        "So we end up at XS after being unable to get in to Hakkansan and trust me we were not disappointed! This place is incredible the inside was gorgeous and the outside was a great spot to enjoy the music and get some fresh air.\\n\\nWe end up seeing Rusko  and dancing the night which was a blast.  I would defiantly recommend checking it out here!",

They are filled with pork and vegies.\\n\\nTheir noodle soup, the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well.  I've tried Mama Woo's Spicy noodles soup too and it was great!",
        "After seeing all the other Cirque shows in Vegas first, I was a little let down by Mystere.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a good show.  It just can't compare side by side to \\\"O\\\" or \\\"Ka\\\" with their higher tech stages.  The performers were great but halfway through the show I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  See this first...then see the other shows.",
        "Holy Moses!!!! Best chicken cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place.",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",

        "this place is great'' I would highly recomend this buffet to everyone who go to vegas. first thing was the pizza it was good and big.second was the pasta tortaini with the alfrado sasue.third was the sushi it was small but it was good and last but not least the dessert was awsome the puding was nice and creamy and the fruit was fruity and the chessecake was magnificent  everything in the buffet was good.",
        "OK- I am giving them 4 stars because I like the artichoke appetizer that much. It is absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe menu is very boring. The rest of the food doesn't inspire me.\\n\\nThe artichoke appetizer is to die for. With a bottle of white wine. Heaven.",
        "Now this is my kind of church!!  I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing when I made my first visit earlier this week!  It was a real church, serving food and beer.....and I loved it!  We had the wood-fired pizza and some Celestial Gold.  Beer was good, and pizza (Spinach, Feta and Artichoke) was excellent.  Service was good as well.  Will definitely return!",

        "My guy is probably going to be upset that I'm dissing the Great Steak, but it was not my pick. I'm okay with compromising when he's that excited about it though. \\n\\nHe really wanted a Great Steak, which is technically a cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato. We just ordered one to split. I wasn't as excited about it as he was, but that's life.",
        "They do not honor warranties in timely fashion. If you have a warranty claim they take a long time before they come and look at it. Unfortunately I can not wait that long as we need hot water.\\nDO NOT USE LARKIN.\\nTheir staff that answered the phone were also very unfriendly.",
        "If the line is not out the door we love Sunday breakfast here. Delicious sweet and\\nsavory selection. the coffee is fresh and better than most places. All the servers/baristas are friendly and helpful. Menu changes frequently so I can't really recommend what is my favorite. If you go on a Sunday be ready for a decent wait 30 mins after they open.",
        "Definitely something that you have to try when you visit Pittsburgh.  Whatever you order, it will be a greaseball.  Ketchup and red devil hot sauce made my sandwich pretty tasty, but I think for that much grease, it should have been phenomenal, not just pretty good."

        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",

All the meats they bring were all very good. So were the fried plantains. Incredible service. Always there when you need them. Not there when you don't. Pricey but worth it for a special night out.",

This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",

The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "Decided to come in this weekend to try the new brunch offerings and WOW was it good. The restaurant features build your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bars with plenty of garnish choices. I ordered the chicken and biscuit skillet (which I shared with my friend because it is so large) and it was delicious! The chicken was most and flavorful and served with fresh cheddar bacon biscuits. Will definitely be back!",
        "Great quality and selection of workout, yoga and athletic apparel.  Not your typical, lame stuff you find at the generic sports stores. The owners & staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful.",
        "Came here to check out the BBQ. It was just okay. Service was good. But just not special enough to come back to. I think this place is more for their drinks.",
        "Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!",
        "Poor customer service they completely suck they ruin your drinks and ruin your experience of going to Starbucks.",
        "One of my favorite stores for shoes. Wonderful selection. I especially love the clearance section organized by size. Super boot collection and great deals on purses. Self service so very comfortable environment.",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "larger stores in phoenix, large selection of fresh meat and seafood and a great selection of microbrews",
        "We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks. I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot. Order it! So delicious!\\n\\nNeed to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome.",
        "Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. \\n\\nI only got shocked to order a Pi\\u00f1a Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Pi\\u00f1a Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!",
        "I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican food but I was expecting good quality food for the price. The flavors where decent bit the meat was fatty and not cooked properly and expensive.",
        "Horrible customer service. I understand the workers are helping customers out, but none greeted or asked if I needed help. I stood there for a good twenty minutes before leaving.  I am an iPhone user but this makes me want to leave the brand. I had some questions that websites don't have a clear answer to.",
        "Good Mexican food, but it's expensive (at least I thought so). I went there for lunch and had the lunch special ($10) and a coconut margarita ($10) which equaled $22 for lunch! The drinks were also slow to come out. So if you're a tourist, I think it's okay. But for a local, it's pricey.",
        "This salon is absolutely excellent.  I go to Lexi, who's one of their more junior stylists, which makes it totally affordable.  She is completely professional and is amazingly good at interpreting my vague and inexperienced descriptions and translating them into beautiful hair.  I have super long dirty blonde hair and she has turned it from drab to Taylor Swift cute!  She's also great at teaching me how to do different styles on my own, which has elevated my look completely!",
        "Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!",
        "Been there many times and have not been disappointed by the BBQ. Only been open for a short time but has won many awards and \\\"best of\\\" contests. Travel Channel has already spotlighted them! Be prepared to wait in line. The quickest I have made it through getting my food is about 40 minutes. Despite the wait, it is still a 5 star join.",
        "not worth going to. go to the south rim its better because u can take pictures there as well as free shuttle buses and a theatre. you have to pay to get in on the west rim as well as not bringing no phones no camera. what is the use of paying $74 a person to go on the skywalk and then not using your camera to take photos that is a rip off. everyone comes miles and miles away to come here to take photos.",
        "Wanna get drunk as a skunk under 5 bucks?? Just sit at a machine over here and play pennies while cocktail waitresses bring you drinks incessantly. The moment you walk in they take your order. I suggest the \\\"Adios Motherf*ucker\\\". You'll thank me later.",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",
        "My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend.",
        "Such good ice cream! They have delicious cookies and you can make your own ice cream sandwich to order. I got two scoops of ice cream and four cookies for less than $7. That's a great price compared to other ice cream shops. I will definitely come back again and again",
        "This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.",
        "Pretty good area! Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat. Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.\\n\\nI prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.",
        "Catfish taco lunch special every Friday.  Great lunch for $5!\\n\\nThat said, the best time of day to visit the Kitchen is happy hour - bargains on very high quality offerings.",
        "Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.\\n\\nThe drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny.",
        "My husband and I needed new screens and batteries for our cell phones.  They were quick to fix the issues and we felt the prices were reasonable.   The store itself is a little hidden.  It's located upstairs in case anyone gets lost!",
        "This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.",
        "Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.",
        "I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",
        "Went for dinner and drinks. Great patio, really good drinks,  and we all really enjoyed our meals. The crowd and vibe were fun. We will definitely be back. Check out the house made turkey burger and nightly drink specials.",
        "Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",
        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "Don't be mistaken TQLA doesn't have Mexican food exactly. It is called \\\"New Mexican\\\" food. While it was pretty delicious I wasn't expecting this. The main difference is that there are a lot healthier choices than a Mexican food restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. The service was excellent. If you are coming here for traditional Mexican food you will be disappointed.",
        "Jac's is the saving grace of Monroe Street. Delicious, reasonably-priced, traditional Americana food in a well-lit, clean, cozy space that can be described as bar-meets-restaurant. The drinks are fabulous, and the Bloody Mary could be a meal in itself with all of the add-ons. Attentive staff, great atmosphere. Will be back.",
        "Service is excellent. Food was so-so. Music is also good. Drinks were tasty. Sit upstairs where the band is.",
        "I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!",
        "When I went to the website to become a \\\"Wino\\\" I was expecting to sample some of the better street wines such Night Train, Thunderbird, MD 20/20 and Cisco. \\n\\nTo my disappointment we toured vineyards and sampled wine costing over $20 a bottle and we did not even get to take a nap under any bridge in Phoenix, AZ.\\n\\nWaste of time and money and over 1/2th of my welfare check",
        "They wanted 30 dollars to hem a apron..when I told them that's too expensive they told me I can go somewhere else and gave me my apron. Don't like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting",
        "This is the best Target in Vegas. I've been to 6 and this store is great. Staff are friendly. Returns are easy. Clearance is regularly cheaper than other area Targets. The only thing missing is a Starbucks. Please please put one in!!!",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "Of course an Apple Store is an Apple Store, but this one is beautiful.  Huge, soaring high ceilings, tons of natural light, and fully stocked.\\n\\nI was there the day of the iPad 2 launch (not there for the iPad, just on the same day) just to browse.  Saw the requisite line of 'opening day' folks on the side of the building, with their friendly neighborhood Apple Store employees passing out snacks and drinks.  Love that.",
        "So after the billet bar finally closed Bar 350 popped up and I hoped they would get away from the wannabe biker bar that billet was and the wannabe crowd that always hung out there.  Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.",
        "I Love Akahana! I think most people don't realize it exists because it is located in a small shopping center beside a little bookstore in Plaza Midwood, but if you've never been and love shush, this is the place to be. They always have buy one get one free specials, tasty drinks and tons of fun rolls to choose from.",
        "Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!",
        "It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.",
        "My wife and I went to the Waterfront tonight. Had a few drinks and appitisers. The coconut  shrimp is awesome. Has some great habanero seasoning with the salad side. It was a lot of fun sitting outside looking over the lake and having a beer. Very nice place, good food, good atmosphere, great staff.",
        "Best fine dining in Scottsdale area. We were seated outside the last time we went and had a fabulous view. It couldn't have been better.\\n\\nThe cocktail list is amazing - lots of unique drinks -- all great -- must try when you go. \\n\\nWe've mostly ordered the specials and have loved everything we've eaten. The seafood is amazing. You will not be disappointed.",
        "I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor."

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Solid, huge hotel.  Our room was in the updated \\\"west wing,\\\" which gets you modern-styled amenities and a small, porthole-like window.\\n\\nLots of dining and lounging choices, with a massive casino and sports book to boot.  There's not much to dislike here, a genuine Vegas Strip experience.  Very convenient, obviously, if you're in town for an event at the arena.",
        "We came to Vegas on a very small budget. We got the buffet of buffets deal and ate at le village, it was lovely. The decor was beautiful and the food was outstanding. We even decided to return for dinner. Very pleased with the entire experience.",
        "Surprise this place doesn't have many reviews . Place stays busy.so on with my review . Well all I can say is there service is at perfection to me . I've heard and experience the horror storys that happens going to the wrong dry cleaners . Trust me that won't happen hear .",
        "My husband and I were totally impressed by the dining experience. Everything, from good quality, presentation to service are top notch. This is our first time dining at a Michelin 3 star restaurant and Joel Robuchon definitely lives up to its reputation.",
        "I absolutely loved the work she did on my eyebrows. It was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded, I did not even know my eyebrows even could look so perfectly shaped! She made it a fast and pleasant experience! I will be going back for sure!",
        "Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \\\"delicious\\\" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!",
        "Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",

        "We were at the point in our Las Vegas vacation where we were sick of food and yet still hungry.  So we tried this place out and, yes ma'am, very good.  My husband had a waffle with frozen yogurt and I had the very berry crepes. Not expensive but not a cheap meal, either.  Good to people watch, great for somethin different in the Vegas experience which did not include the word 'buffet'.",

The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!!  I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!",

My steak was dry and flavorless. It was a huge disappointment. Since there are many steak options in this city. I wouldn't chance it if I were you.",
        "This is one of our favorite places to go.  Good food, love the omelets and of course the bacon.  Good coffee.  Service can depend on who's area you are seated in, but over all we haven't had a bad experience.  Make sure if you go at lunch that you order before any big groups, it can take a while.",
        "I had a so-so experience at AZ on the Rocks my first visit but due to the absolutely wonderful follow up and customer service I have received since then I am definitely amending my original review. The owner really went out of his way to make sure that my next visit is much better. As soon as my schedule allows I will be heading back to check it out for the second time.",
        "What a fun trip down memory lane! I loved seeing some of the old pinball machines (and a TRON video game! Holy crap!), and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood. Everyone should go here and visit at least once.",
        "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger.\\nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips.\\nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.\\n\\nThis was worth trying once.",
        "Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.",
        "Dear Lord. We've been sitting here 45 minutes and got 1 drink and still no food. IT'S SATURDAY. And it's EMPTY.  We are only staying to see how long it takes at this point. Completely horrible experience. I may not stay at the hotel again I'm so upset.",

After back and forth they fixed it and when I drove a block the problem was worsen. I called no call back.",
        "DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR!! The bartender was a total jerk and made it very clear that he didn't want to help us. The sad thing is that the food was good and when we relocated to the back of the restaurant or experience improved and our waiter was much nicer and helpful.",

Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",

I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",

        "Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them.  Holy cow, what a disaster.  Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all.  This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits.

Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "I just ate here and I order some garlic shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp was so over cooker, it was super hard and I could even taste where it was burnt on the edges. The garlic, needless to say, was also very burnt. I pretty much didn't like the salsa and beans all too much and I generally could have had a much better dining experience here.",

Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.

        "No doubt that the coffee was excellent- but the barista was rude and very cantankerous, despite attempts at being friendly. Not to mention the bathroom was out of toilet paper and just had a sign that said 'sorry- public bathrooms available down the street'. I wish I could give a better review since their coffee is great- but the experience was lackluster.",
        "iced green tea... all year long!",
        "Considering the hype about this place, I will admit that I went into this meal with high expectations.  There are lots of menu options and you can customize your burger experience.  It just didn't live up to all the hype.  Without the hype, this place gets 4 stars, but if you go in hoping for a better-than-average burger you won't be disappointed.",
        "Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!",
        "Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty.",
        "I had been frequenting another North Shore location for years but I thought I would give Rivertowne a try and it was good. I had the baked Italian sub and it was tasty, cold beer, intimate space, nice views, plenty of TV's, all good. The service could be faster and more personable and cleanliness could be better but all-in-all a pleasant experience and I will be back.",
        "Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.",
        "Solid.  In and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet.  \\n\\nNice staff and good service.",
        "Since my first experience, I've gone back 3 times. There is definitely a lack of turn-around time regarding the point of ordering and receiving your good. \\nThe place gets a few large orders, and if you are the unlucky one who gets stuck behind those orders, it is a test of patience. I still believe they need to improve their process regarding high order times. It is simply unacceptable...",
        "The service is the BEST in town!  Did you know that this engine runs on veggie oil?  Good for your tummy and good for the environment.  An all around PERFECT experience.  Thank you Cpt. Bill",
        "Disappointed... Went in with a friend, my coffee was quite bitter, and the service was unpleasant. It took 30 min to get our sandwhich while other customers walked out with their food in hand. This is my second bad experience so I doubt I will be returning. :(",
        "Beware of this place.  If you give them a credit card they will charge $25 on it no matter what even if you paid cash.  It happened to us a few nights ago.  We called the bar and they said it's their standard practice to charge this and then sometime later in the week to refund it.  Total BS we paid in cash there should be no charge on my card period.  We will never go back.",
        "Nice experience. Good price. For me, an hour is too long and 30 is too short.  Go for the 45.",
        "People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "Entire experience was outstanding from spotting Don (husband of Vicky from the Real Housewives of the O.C) to my first time having brussel sprouts and Kobe NY strip,  the BF had Hangar Steak and for dessert we have a Jasmine Panna Cotta with Poney and Pears.\\n\\nI quite do not understand how there are vegetarians out there.  I love the smell and taste of beef!",
        "Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!",

I have a small mouth and he's very considerate, especially when performing procedures.  His staff of hygienists and assistants are very nice and pleasant to deal with.  I would recommend this office to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a dentist.",
        "Had the worse nail experience here. I asked for a nail trim and a fill. The woman cut off some of my skin said \\\"sorry\\\" and passed me off to someone else. Wtf?! Definitely not going back!",
        "If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",
        "Wonderful experience. Nice little sushi house. The fish was fresh and the rolls were rolled nicely and balanced in flavor. \\n\\nOur server - short with curly hair - was very knowledgable and kind. \\n\\nI checked in with yelp and whereas it says that you receive a free appetizer with a check in, that's incorrect. You get a gross sweet little cocktail-type drink. I was kinda annoyed by that.",
        "The food is good but I'm disappointed at the stinginess .. They give plastic ware but I ask for 4 paper plates and was told I have to pay a dollar a piece? Really? Horrible business practice over something like plates!",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "No rating (just putting that in theater 12 there is a speaker in the front right that may be damaged. I heard a crack sound ((a sound a speaker makes when damaged))\\n\\nOtherwise a fun movie experience. \\n\\nCheers",
        "Meatballs are excellent. Love the atmosphere too. Make sure to sit inside, way better than outside trust me.",
        "This place is fantastic! Lots of healthy options from a very knowledgable and friendly staff. I highly recommend the Mock Tacos entree and the curried chickpea salad. The Jamaican Hibiscus iced tea is also to die for.",
        "Stay away!!!! This AAA approved shop made me cancel my membership after the experience that I received from these guys.\\nThe worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Will not honor their warranty and will tow your vehicle if you try to dispute their work. Their service clerks are RUDE, unprofessional, and misinformed nit wits.",
        "This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!",
        "I went here again & I brought a girlfriend who's never had a foot massage.  I asked for Rex again & she got a woman, can't remember her name.  My friend has had regular massages before & also pedicures with a ft massage & definitely thought this was first rate.  My friend was kicking back & remarked afterwards at how strong their arms/hands are to give such a strong wonderful foot massage.",
        "Sad experience.  Went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for $10.99.  They only had 3 pieces of chicken.  That's not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left.  The employee made it pretty clear he wouldn't make more.",
        "One word. Nasty! Take a walk to burger bar at Mandalay shoppes better service and way better food!!!!",
        "As always outstanding food and service. We've been dining here for over a  year now and we have never been disappointed! The food has always been spectacular and the ambiance of the restaurant fabulous. I highly reccomend this restaurant for authentic Italian dining. The owner really takes pride in providing a fabulous dining experience for his guest and it shows. We can't wait to go back!",
        "Used my Groupon for a massage and blow out. Massage was very relaxing. Shampoo and style were ok. Stylist was a little slow to style my hair, as he was using a blow dryer that wasn't very powerful. Overall a pleasant experience. Friendly staff and central location. I will book a repeat appointment.",
        "Third time here and each time it is a great experience.  Atmosphere  is fun and relaxing.  A must for a girls pamper day.  Pedicures and gel manicures are amazing and last for weeks.",
        "Girls in Lingerie, explosions, pirates, one-liners, and more girls in lingerie!  What's not to love?\\n\\nIt's a great show to experience at least once.  It's pretty cheesy but hey you're in Las Vegas.  No problem bringing the kids.....they will be amazed by the songs, dancing, and pyrotechnics."

        "A bit much for adults, but great for the young ones.  Lots of animated animals and large fish tanks.  Food is amusement park fare to match the ambiance.  A bit pricey if you don't appreciate the showmanship of the place.  Fine for families but not for a date in my view.  Service was very slow.",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there.",
        "Their beer sampler is fun way to sample their good beers and have fun at the same time. I thought their fish fry was really good, too.\\n\\nIf you're going to dine there during warm month, try the pretty outside garden seating and make sure to share appetizer with friends for start of a nice evening to ensue.",
        "Ate here before seeing Terry Fator. This is my first time eating at this chain. I was NOT impressed. Freschetta FROZEN pizza tasted better than this place. The prices were ridiculous. For the same price I would rather go to Settebello's. They are the BEST pizza in town! Save your money and forgo California Pizza Kitchen.",
        "I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy....",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",

        "After seeing my 2nd show here, I can say it will be my last.  Super over-priced drinks, and if you aren't near the stage, it's almost impossible to get a good view.  I don't know why bands continue to have poolside concerts.. The Hard Rock pool is even worse.  I'd much rather see a show at a regular venue with a decent layout.",

Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",

        "Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them.  Holy cow, what a disaster.  Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all.  This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits.  They really need to get this under control.",
        "Great place to grab a few beers with the friends. Awesome energy. Love going there!",

He showed me they have honey behind the counter. I'd recommend this place any day to barbecue lovers.",

Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training.",
        "There is nothing Grand Canyon-esque about the Grand Canyon Experience except the fake rock facade and the real birds that have taken up residence inside (I saw three).

There are two floors packed with stuff you don't need.",

They have a big selection of local draft beers. Wings are good, burgers excellent, good deserts. I've never had a bad meal here. I've only sat in the bar area. I've been 6 or 7 times and the service and food always consistently good.",

I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",
        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "Jac's is the saving grace of Monroe Street. Delicious, reasonably-priced, traditional Americana food in a well-lit, clean, cozy space that can be described as bar-meets-restaurant. The drinks are fabulous, and the Bloody Mary could be a meal in itself with all of the add-ons. Attentive staff, great atmosphere. Will be back.",

        "Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.",
        "Love the view from the hole in the rock butte! Good thing it's quite an easy hike so I'm able to bring my boys here from time to time. Once you're up there, you could see the Phoenix zoo to the left, Sky Harbor airport to the front, and Scottsdale to the right.",
        "Was expensive even with \\\"half off.\\\" Had a lot of beers, first two picks were out though. Bartender seemed rushed to finish with me. If you're looking to try hundreds of beer on tap this is the place for you, just make sure to bring a lot of money.",

Be sure to also check out the Hines Chapel right next door.",

The seafood is amazing. You will not be disappointed.",

        "Enjoyed the ambiance here when I passed through for a book launch shortly before the holidays. Ideal for a literary evening, or for a conversation with a well-suited friend at the bar, the space feels like it's tucked with decor brought home from long travels. Hints of Havana and East India in the 1950s when the light is just right. I only had a beer but glanced over the cocktail menu and would be curious to return.",
        "this place is good for family,  The price is right and they serve good beer.  The food is pretty good four stars are for the service.  I don't like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction",

        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Had a guys weekend trip and we shared a deluxe fab room with two queen beds. The room was nice and beds were soft. The view wasn't great but we were in the room about 15 hours over three nights so a view isn't required. Staff were nice. I recommend bringing an extension cord since its an older hotel their are no plugins accessible by the bed.",
        "Terrible service. Never anyone around to help. Food was just ok  fries soggy. Took 10 minutes to get mustard for out burgers. Beers were flat.  Will never come back. So many other great places in Pittsburgh. This place is a complete waste of your time",

Somehow it was just the way I liked it. \\nThe environment is cute and quant (Even their bathrooms) \\nThe best part was the their service. The place is really small, but he staff will go out if their way to find a seat for you.\\nI'll definitely be coming  back",
        "Can't complain, can't rave. Typical, middle-of-the-road sushi place. Food was fresh, tasted fine. The price was.....OK. The food took a really long time. Service was good, but the waiter tends to invade one's personal space a lot. Better happy hour deals would entice me back, but as it is, I'll stick with my all-you-can-eat favorites.",
        "If you want to be ignored, listen to your bartenders complain about their lives, enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers, and have that true crap Southside experience, this is the place to be.",
        "The snails and bread were good otherwise don't eat dinner here.  Slimy undercooked farmed salmon and greasy cheesy pasta.  No one at our table liked the various other entrees. Great view of the strip though!",
        "I'm definitely a fan of Gordon Ramsey- I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious! But their fries and onion rings may need a revisit from Gordon Ramsey :( but overall it's a great experience.",
        "Environment looked promising with an almost-filled crowd.  The coffee tasted all right (ordered a latte and an americano), but weak compared to other coffee shops I've been to.  The latte was well-made, for sure.\\n\\nReceived a little bit of a snobby attitude from the staff who were walking around.  The staff at the counter/register were friendly though.",
        "It's a PITA to get in if you're with all guys as they allow only 1:1 male:female ratio. This is great because women outnumber the guys, and there is nothing worse than going into a club and being surrounded by guys (unless that's your thing). It get extremely crowded even though there are 3 different areas of the club. Tao Beach has a great view. Overall a decent Vegas club.",
        "I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment.",
        "So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.\\n\\nWe would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \\\"intestine shaped like squirrel\\\", anyone?\\n\\nExcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment.",

        "This place visually is nice, as far as the attitude of staff and service don't expect too much unless you are the money mogul type. This place is ran by old school people that still lives in the 1930's. They try to pass off as if they are hardcore bad asses or something, especially on the craps tables.\\n\\nI am sorry to say but this place is stuck up, but hey, i guess it is to be expected that's life.",
        "Horrible Service. Felt unwelcome as soon as I came in. Their open sign was \\\"on\\\" but when I walked in the owner was using the restaurant as a meeting space for some type of large group. They were bugged I came in and told me I couldn't eat inside, and that i'd have to eat on the patio. Food isn't that good either. Rice and Meat were all extremely dry.",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "Not so much for me . Last years participants was not impressive. I would rather spend more money and go to one of the bigger events like devoured , feast on the streets , or taste of biltmore. My friends that go like it because its family friendly so i can see that point of view , it is family friendly and a nice way to kick off the summer.",
        "View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful.",
        "t's back!  They have moved to the old Blockbuster Space in Quail Corners at 8400-A Park Road..  By far the best Salsarita's location in Charlotte.  (I thought that about the old location as well).  Ingredients are fresh, and the quality is impeccable.",
        "Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.",
        "Pretty impressive landscaping, floral and fauna display. Free admission, but I suggest spending the extra $2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds.",
        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?",
        "If you go here, sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh! We came here for drinks but the food looked good. Wednesday is their $1 beer special and $5.50 martini night. The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10.",
        "From the ride up to the museum to strolling through the grounds, this museum is world class.\\nI usually check the current exhibits before planning a trip there.

She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.

Service is great, too!",

This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",
        "We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",

The music was good. I'd go back here if I'm ever in vegas.",
        "Did not like this place at all. It was small and very empty. Now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening, but we left and went right to the mirage's other club, and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun (5 minutes after this place).  So, not sure what the story was on that.",

It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",

Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!",
        "The place looked good from the outside. Yet, as I ordered one of their burgers, I was disappointed. The beef patty was very thin and soggy. The fries were, in addition to sharing the sogginess of the burger, a tad cold. The place was packed though--so, it must have been one of those orders that did not hit the mark. I am not sure I would go back.",

We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender.

        "Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well.",

Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",

I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "This place has great food but their customer service is very lousy. They were very rude to us from beginning to end especially the guy with one eye and no one seemed to care. Not used to that kind of service and will never go back no matter how good the food is. No one should be treated like that.",
        "Good food and a surprisingly intimate venue at the quiet end of the strip. Well worth giving a try, kind of a little gem. I had the duck which was okay, the breast could have been more tender but the presentation was good and the taste was balanced.",
        "One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.",
        "It was pretty much what I expected except for the mermaids. Kind of a let down not to see them but still nice to see and very relaxing to sit next to with the pro shop waterfall in the background. Overall it was a nice change from the overcrowded strip for a change.",
        "A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. \\n\\nThere are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.",

        "I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner.

        "My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "Fried chicken salad was really good. Good service. Only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth. I said no, a table. Arrived on time and it was packed...and they had saved us a booth.  Kind of pricey, though, unless you get the happy-hour specials. And there were families with kids in there; little kids, so it's ok to bring your family.",
        "Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "So this place was packed when we got here, so we opted just to get a pastry to go.  We had the chaussons aux pommes, mmmm good.  The apple was a little tart and not too sweet.  The pastry shell itself was delicious, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We wish we were able to fully enjoy what this place had to offer after having the pastry we wanted more! Definitely worth checking out!",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "Amazing one of a kind furniture!  I have purchased several items for my new home and love everything I chose.  Everything is hand painted and has a special touch.  Owners are very nice and have a delivery service available to assist you if you don't own a truck.  Check it out!!",

        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",

        "I went here with my girlfriend and neither of us were impressed with the food. She had the brisket sandwich which completely lacked any sort of flavor along with corn on the cob which was soggy and inedible. As for me I had the baby back ribs which were OK but far from great. I would not recommend this place to any friend and will certainly not be coming back.",
        "A student-friendly take on the whole style bar thing that would have looked and felt quite modern and interesting about 8 years ago, but now just feels lazy.\\n\\nJust like the slovenly, disinterested staff, whom oddly enough I actually warmed to due to their sheer indifference. Having worked behind bars myself, and felt exactly like them doing it, a trip to Koko invariably ends up feeling like a trip down memory lane.",

        "I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good.",
        "Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.",
        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",
        "Great selection, freshess of fish-good, but I've had better, prices are average, happy hour is great, as far as their service...slow and weak so they get 3 stars",

        "Wonderful experience. Nice little sushi house. The fish was fresh and the rolls were rolled nicely and balanced in flavor. \\n\\nOur server - short with curly hair - was very knowledgable and kind. \\n\\nI checked in with yelp and whereas it says that you receive a free appetizer with a check in, that's incorrect. You get a gross sweet little cocktail-type drink. I was kinda annoyed by that.",

I totally had a blast!\\nI took stars out for price ($50 for him and $20 for me, ladies were free before midnight)",

        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "Gross. Gross, gross, gross. \\nNot my choice to dine here. The food is super greasy, inauthentic, and unpleasant. Even the fruit cup had stupid fruit- you know, the kind that's not ripe and isn't varied. \\n\\nThere are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, and not all of them are expensive. If you're using yelp, please, go find a better spot for breakfast.",
        "Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good.",

The snacks and beverages at this store might be kind of overpriced just like everything else in Vegas but the great thing about this store is that they're open 24 hours .",
        "From being greeted at the door by the owner to the kind and gentle attention one seated the experience and ambiance matched the excellent quality ingredients of the food.  Great value for the money.  Recommend come early evening or very late night.  The place is packed with locals and tourist.",
        "Normal sort of South Side divey bar. However, I'm pretty sure they have the best wings deal I've ever seen (feel free to prove me wrong!). there is but one stipulation: you must order a beer/drink with your wings. But come on? Beer is the perfect drink to go with wings. Where they get you though is that it costs at least a dollar to get veggies or dippers.",
        "I will eat here when a friend insists, but I think almost every time I've eaten here, I have gotten diarrhea.  And the food isn't worth the diarrhea.  Its kind of bland.  And its overpriced.  Just my opinion though.  I know lots of people are ga-ga over this place.",
        "Very nice walking path. Always clean and well manicured! Keep up the great work Henderson!",
        "I was visiting a friend and stopped in for a mani/pedi. For $40 I expect at least some effort put into my nails and a manicure to last the week. The girl that worked on me barely scrubbed my feet, pretended to push my cuticles back and my fingernails were chipping 2 days later. Next time I'll go to the CVS across the street, buy polish and do them myself! What a waste of money.",
        "Good food. Girl is not too friendly  unless your Turkish.\\nSMALL portions LARGE PRICES! Not enough hummus or babagounish. Veggie platter price keeps going up with all the other prices. Really good food just skimpy on things and prices are very expensive for this kind of fast food.",
        "Environment looked promising with an almost-filled crowd.  The coffee tasted all right (ordered a latte and an americano), but weak compared to other coffee shops I've been to.  The latte was well-made, for sure.\\n\\nReceived a little bit of a snobby attitude from the staff who were walking around.  The staff at the counter/register were friendly though.",

If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "The short answer is we heard about this place and walked from the strip to the restaurant.  We go there right before they opened so they ask us to sit inside, gave us menus and water, but we had to wait for them to open.  this kind of service happened the rest of our visit, and the food was worth the walk, and we will do it again.",
        "Best Buffet I've been to in Vegas so far, but that's not really saying much seeing that I've only been to a couple.  They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF / Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent.",

        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria.",

        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",

I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",

No.  So they had to make more steak, because of course they didn't think anyone else at 6 o'clock would order steak, and saw no need to make more upon running low.  \\n\\nAlso, the rice wasn't cooked all the way.\\n\\n2 stars only because they were friendly.",
        "Really gorgeous breakfast, everything looked good, but the pancakes were divine! Massive portions, but that's America! Taste was exceptional, one of the best places, for breakfast, I've ever eaten. The price was very good, about $40 for coffees and 2 lots of pancakes and that's including a generous, although normal, tip for America. Great atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Don't be put off by the queue; it moves quickly.",
        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",

Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley.",

        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.  Their breakfast sausage was also outstanding.  Boy do I wish that they would distribute nationally like Fra Mani does.  Business would grow exponentially.  This place is absolutely outstanding.  Service is great, too!",
        "The food was pretty descent for the most part. My biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok.",

Hopefully when I revisit this place, my rating changes for the better.",

From decoration to menu, it was all a snore.\\nI dont usually use how busy a dining floor is to judge how good a restaurant is, but when we were here, the place was completely empty, so i'm positive I wasnt the only person that was bored with this place.",

        "I tried this place after receiving a coupon in the Norterra flyer. I wasn't disappointed. This place has really good pizza and salads! Service was very speedy and their food was excellent. We ended up splitting a salad and a pizza and still had food to take home! Sauce also servers wine and beer which really compliments the food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food.",

        "This was literally the worse buffet food I have ever had and really has no place on the Vegas Strip. The food was bland, poorly presented and of medicore quality. The line layout is inefficient and confusing and the dessert table was like something at a gas stations snack area. Not even worth it when its free.",

When our bagels took a little longer than expected we were offered 2 more drinks on the house (generous and unexpected!) - the flat white is top quality.\\n\\nEverything looks like it'd be just as good. Quick tip, 'would you like side salad' means extra salad on top of what is served with the food - it'd be cool if they made this a bit more clear!",
        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",

Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town.

        "Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!",
        "Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, it is very boring inside and atmosphere wise a little cold, but the burgers, oh baby the burgers are an easy five stars. These big, juicy, sloppy sandwiches are so freaking good. Get a double with cheese and bacon and indulge.",

        "I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.",

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-b-buffet-henderson)\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving it another star is because that creme brulee is out of this world. And maybe I didn't hate their meat as much this time.",
        "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.",
        "Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\\n\\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.",
        "Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \\n\\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!",
        "A foodie friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant and it was very good. Why not 5 stars? Because I reserve those for the very best. Still, this was very, very good. Very imaginative and tasty. I had a goat dish of mutli parts and the flavors were wonderful. So was the service. Check it out, you wan't be disappointed.",
        "The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25",
        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "I had a so-so experience at AZ on the Rocks my first visit but due to the absolutely wonderful follow up and customer service I have received since then I am definitely amending my original review.

I felt like I should have apologized for being there.\\n\\nThe food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!\\n\\nOverpriced for the quality of food and service. \\n\\nI highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.",

        "Pinky's is a great place to stop for breakfast, or to grab a quick sandwich. The prices are good, and the service is friendly. It's the perfect place to take your really picky nephew who won't eat anything but grilled cheese or spaghetti... because they have something that he will eat.",
        "Very nice meal.  The lobster bisque is really TO DIE FOR!  The lobster Surf n Turf is the Business!  I also had an order of crab legs with the filet, however not as tasty as the lobster for sure!  Wonderful restaurant! Loved the lay-out and decor!",
        "This place never disappoints when it comes to quick fresh food. I never feel like a disgusting slob full of grease leaving Wahoo's. They have a dish for everyone including vegetarians. The Decor is really cool with the walls being covered in Action Sports memorabilia.  There's also tv's everywhere for the sports fanatics.",
        "It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!",

Plus I have been traveling to research dishes when I open my own izakaya restaurant. \\n\\nOf course, my friend and I come here after being at LAX, so we may have gotten in on the tail-end of it all. Overall, it was not bad. Seems like the type of place you go with friends to drink and be merry. Not the culinary adventure I was expecting.",

        "The food here was okay and the prices are reasonable, but one thing I would say is that front line need while serving food need to be keep a lot cleaner than it is now. To many places at the front counter there cross contamination with the food.  With some focus and people who care this place can be great.",
        "Happy hour for drinks. Nice ambience and super customer service and Salt fish fritter! I didn't give 5 star due to not trying actual food. But great overall",
        "For the fans of Bueno Burger it's no bueno because the lights have been turned off at this location. I was going to do lunch on New Year's Day and there was a For Lease sign. It's a shame, the lady who ran this place was so accomodating. She let me crash there while waiting for AAA after I pulled into the adjacent parking lot with a flat tire a couple of months ago.",
        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",
        "It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.",
        "Nasty.   Bad food.  Rude,  indifferent staff.  1 star is being generous.",
        "Crap..... giving two stars only because waitress was helpful. Shrimp is extremely fishy and everyone else's food was bland."

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",
        "Ridiculously great bartenders. \\nFrom Noon til 5, Monday through Friday, you can have any drink in the bar for $2.\\nThey have Slim Jim's and Twinkies.\\nFree shows all the damn time.",
        "Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.",
        "Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.",
        "Man, Village Inn... is the best.  Came here twice in the last two years (not from the area) and definitely made a point to come in on Wednesday for free pie, y'all!!  Seriously who can beat that.  \\n\\nHad the strawberry banana french toast once and then a dinner entree another and they were all sooo gooood omg.",
        "I most certainly love Five Guys Burgers & Fries! Dude, even their hot dogs rock!",
        "It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!",
        "Went back today for lunch. I had the Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. It was fabulous. Had great flavor, crunchy bread. Came with fries and a drink. \\nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \\nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \\nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome.",
        "Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...",
        "If you order online and it's wednesday or later in the week DO NOT  use 2d day UPS you will not get your part unless you're  very close by. I'm in Texas and ordered on wednesday thinking I could get my parts by saturday latest.....nope 5 days later they arrive(what the Hell is 2 day air?) needless to say no more business from me. Yes I wrote them and they didn't have the courtesy to reply either.",
        "i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review.",
        "Ordered chicken fingers and fries on special for $5.95. The chicken fingers were the kind of chicken you find in a $1 McDonald's chicken sandwich. The fries were completely tasteless. No salt. For the price, Jack in the Box or Farm Basket is much much better. Will not eat here again.",
        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",
        "I love this place for dinner.  A very nice variety.  Service has always been good for me and the portions are huge.    I would tend to stay away from seafood here though.  I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",
        "Gross. \\n\\nLo Mein was incredibly salty, without much other flavor. \\n\\nEgg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",
        "I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy....",
        "Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "Sports connection is a lot of things. For many hours in the day it is a kids birthday party Mecca and rainy day play outlet. On Saturday nights it because more of a bowling alley. The pizza is decent and they have some good beer choices on draft including OMB. The bowling alley can be very busy and it's not cheap but you will have fun.",
        "We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",
        "Cafe Myriade is a cute little coffee shop serving 49th Parallel Coffee.\\n\\nComing here with high expectation and was a little disappointed!\\n\\nBoth Americano and Cappuccino we ordered were both overly fruity to even sour.\\n\\nThe search of a great cup of espresso drink continues....maybe I just stuck to drinking beers!",
        "The BBQ is decent, depending on what you get (the brisket is meh, the chicken is pretty good, the ribs are decent).  The Saturday college football viewing is nice.  The service is friendly, even when your kids are making a huge mess.  It's definitely going in the Saturday afternoon rotation.",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "Small quaint little airport. Pretty nice not the fanciest. You can gamble if you like there. Luggage is weird. You have to take a train to another area to get your luggage. Shuttle to the strip is easy and cheap, 7 dollars one way. Better then driving and cheaper and more relaxing.",
        "This company was supposed to send an academic book to my brother. After failing to do so, we drove to the branch in Phoenix where a staff member complained about how she was supposed to off the clock! \\n\\nWe waited so long for the package once we got there. How unprofessional.",
        "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.",
        "Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\\n\\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger.\\nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips.\\nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.\\n\\nThis was worth trying once.",
        "Dear Lord. We've been sitting here 45 minutes and got 1 drink and still no food. IT'S SATURDAY. And it's EMPTY.  We are only staying to see how long it takes at this point. Completely horrible experience. I may not stay at the hotel again I'm so upset.",
        "The place looked good from the outside. Yet, as I ordered one of their burgers, I was disappointed. The beef patty was very thin and soggy. The fries were, in addition to sharing the sogginess of the burger, a tad cold. The place was packed though--so, it must have been one of those orders that did not hit the mark. I am not sure I would go back.",
        "Best hot and sour soup I've ever had!\\n\\nTake out! It's a hole in the wall. Family owned and ran, great people! I've been going here since a kid service and quality are consistent! Make sure you call in your order takes forever but that's how you know it's fresh!",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Food was pretty good. Nothing too unique or memorable besides the decor, and the 60s music absolutely killed the mood. They need to keep with the theme and have instrumental chill music. Ciabatta chicken sandwich was ok. Bread lacked the traditional ciabatta flavor. Sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. Hummus was pretty good, though the pita tasted a bit raw?",
        "Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.",
        "Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen.",
        "i recommend dining here during Thursday - Polynesian night! \\nTry the roasted pig / lechon yum yum!",
        "Worst experience my sienna van had a wrap around warranty I bought thru them and they said they would repair my van and got me a rental car then the next day they said they would not honor their word. After back and forth they fixed it and when I drove a block the problem was worsen. I called no call back.",
        "Ehhhhhhh.\\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",
        "During marching season, my boyfriend and I went here nearly every Friday for date night. We still go every few Fridays, as we absolutely love it here! The food is delicious, especially the curry and coconut ice cream. The servers are always kind, they tend to try keeping conversations short and to the point. Its an extremely nice restaurant.",
        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \\n\\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.",
        "Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "Although it is a plastic paddys, it was a high energy plastic paddys last Saturday night.  We had lots of drinks and enjoyed watching the people and having our kidney stones pulverized by the driving bass.  Nobody singin about Danny Boy or how much they hate  the fuckin Brits in this joint!\\n\\nWe had fun but, if you are gonna call yourself an Irish pub, do something Irish.",
        "Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.",
        "Very impressed with the food, prices, service and look.  Great family atmosphere with really good stuffed burgers. I recommend the Firehouse Burger with sweet potato fries.  I also had the Dry Rub wings and will say they are hard to beat.  I'm very impressed and will definitely recommend this to my friends!",
        "good fries",
        "How can anyone visit the boutique when there is no address listed? Plus, when I tried to click on another post that said it was closed, the response from the owner can't be seen... Not going to get business that way",
        "Good place to grab breakie in Scottsdale. I had the traditional Benedict and it was quite tasty. Service was fast and friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all. We grabbed a latte from the coffee bar and sat inside for a few minutes before they had a patio table ready for us. If I return I'll try to Cinnamon Challah French Toast.",
        "Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.",
        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees. The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!",
        "I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong.",
        "Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service",
        "I was surprised to read the negative reviews here, I actually really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very nice, a couch, a refrigerator, nice bathroom couldn't ask for more. I have stayed at many hotels and wouldn't normally stay here but my brother is a regular gambler here and when I come with him this is where we always stayed. I love having the monorail right at the doorsteps, sure beats driving especially after a night out.",
        "This is your typical greasy spoon place. A run down resto that has amazing hot dogs, fries and poutine. Not a classy place but a great spot for a quick bite.",

        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\\n\\nI will never go back there again.",
        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "Cute place, but a bit pricey-good setup on Saturday mornings next to the farmers market. I had a slice of the banana bread which was good and the world's smallest mocha, which wasn't that good and was $4. I feel better knowing I got a free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  I will have to try some food next time I'm near here.",

        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "I introduced this joint to my five companions on my most recent trip to Sin City and they immediately made it their dining choice every night (i should say morning..) for the remainder of the trip.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong coming to this place, unless you try to eat at around 7pm. In that case, expect a 75min wait for the best value restaurant in the county.",
        "Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago.",
        "I never thought much of this place but tried it again recently and it was alright.  Nice that they have Old Meck on tap, the beer is bitchin.  I had their chili cheese fries and they were a fail.  It was like that liquid cheese like the jar stuff by frito lay.  The chili was like real chili and made the fries slimey and wet.  I had wings as the main course and they were good, no complaints with them.",
        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",
        "Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \\\"chicken\\\" tacos.",
        "Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...\\n\\nPassed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus",
        "I mean I have been going here for years and it truly is A-OK. It's nothing amazing but after a long night out or if you happen to find yourself there the next morning, it's a solid place to grab something to eat. The food is solid but not mind blowing and the service is just right. Granted one of the biggest benefits to this cafe vs. other casino cafe's is they still offer Keno service to your table.",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",

        "Seriously, no idea how anyone could give a good review for this awful restaurant. Agreed on the nice setting. But the food is terrible. And really overpriced! It's always empty...for good reason. I make better fajitas than this place (and so does TGIF) but they charge $22 for them...and sour cream is extra. Food cannot be less authentic. No clue about Mexican food at all. Save yourself the bother.",
        "Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.",

        "Catfish taco lunch special every Friday.  Great lunch for $5!\\n\\nThat said, the best time of day to visit the Kitchen is happy hour - bargains on very high quality offerings.",
        "We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.",
        "Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs",

        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good.",
        "Worst meal ever. Everything I ordered was bad and it was really expensive. The Latte I ordered was cold and she ended up microwaving it instead of making me a new one. The Tar Tar was gross. Eek! Methinks not."

        "The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \\\"homemade\\\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.",
        "Restaurant sympa, la nourriture est bonne et originale mais l'ambiance est un peu froide et le service impersonnel.",
        "Great location for finding better clothes. I have found East Mesa, South Gilbert, Chandler, and Northwest Scottsdale to have the best clothing at these Goodwills! I love 50% saturdays and service is usually pretty good! Just try to beat the crowd early on the 50% saturdays or go later in the day.",
        "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.",
        "The worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art. This gallery is neither progressive, provocative, or intellectually stimulating. It is perfect for Charlotte.",
        "First time. Staff is nice. Typical bar and typical Charlotte food aka crap. But if you were born in the south you may like it. North people stay away",
        "Yum! First time having breakfast here. Great menu with combination of upscale dishes and standards. Large portions. Awesome porch. Bar service. Love how they converted this area landmark. Good happy hour. Solid food and service. So happy to have this restaurant/bar in this area!",
        "Moira  updated their menu and took off those frozen potstickers that I mentioned in my earlier review.  Service was terrific and their new offerings were delicious.  They have a roll topped with a coconut shrimp that is very tasty.  Also enjoyed the $5 bombers that were on special for Halloween.",
        "A Charlotte staple in need of a makeover. Generally solid food but sometimes inconsistent - biggest challenge is the atmosphere which is stale and hasn't kept up with the rest of the Charlotte restaurant scene. You can't go wrong by a visit to PC - especially if the weather is nice and you get to sit on the excellent patio. Salads are great here.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "This gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist.  I hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow Charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.",
        "My boss and I go here every week. This place is clean fast and consistent they know us by name... \\n\\nBeyond that, they have the best club sandwich in Charlotte.",
        "Fresh tasty North Carolina style barbecue. Good sweet tea as well. Only thing missing was honey which is tastes great with hush puppies. But when I paid my tab met Steve Spoon introduced himself. Very friendly guy. He is the grandson of Bill who started the business. He said next time just ask him and he will give me some. He showed me they have honey behind the counter. I'd recommend this place any day to barbecue lovers.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!",
        "Solid Mexican in a seedy part of town.  It's a shame that Carolina's is so close otherwise I might drop by here more often.",
        "I had been frequenting another North Shore location for years but I thought I would give Rivertowne a try and it was good. I had the baked Italian sub and it was tasty, cold beer, intimate space, nice views, plenty of TV's, all good. The service could be faster and more personable and cleanliness could be better but all-in-all a pleasant experience and I will be back.",
        "I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",
        "Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.",
        "The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\\n\\nGood chili.",
        "First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35",
        "Great pork belly tacos.Small plates nice to try many items.Has good energy buzzing.Definitley will be returning next time in Charlotte.",
        "Jac's is the saving grace of Monroe Street. Delicious, reasonably-priced, traditional Americana food in a well-lit, clean, cozy space that can be described as bar-meets-restaurant. The drinks are fabulous, and the Bloody Mary could be a meal in itself with all of the add-ons. Attentive staff, great atmosphere. Will be back.",
        "First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying.",
        "Bonnes bi\\u00e8res, bonne ambiance et bien situ\\u00e9. C'est bien qu'ils aient am\\u00e9lior\\u00e9 leur menu bouffe.",
        "I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.",
        "It is so hard to find a good mechanic that will not just try to take your money for nothing. This place is fantastic!  I was told somewhere else that I needed a tire alignment and instead of just selling me on it they told me or want necessary. I was in and out so fatty. No unnecessary waiting. I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen. BEST MECHANIC EVER!",
        "This Subway was hopping the night my friend and I were here. It was before the Carly Rae Jepsen/Hot Chelle Rae concert downtown and a local high school dance, and the employees were bum rushed. We went at the perfect time, just before all the high school kids flocked in. Our service was fast and spot on. The food was excellent and right on the money.",
        "I am shocked.  Only one review for ETHD.  A Phoenix institution. \\n\\nThousands of us do jury duty.  Ed's is a must stop on jury day.  Especially for the Chicago Dog.  He has all the napkins you need, plus places to sit.",
        "I still continue to go to this place on a regular basis. The food still is always superb and the service there is impeccable. I've taken lots of different people there, and everyone has always loved it. If you're in this area of Charlotte, you should definitely check this place out. It's one of those hidden gems in a strip mall that you'll be happy you visited.",
        "Great location to watch a summer storm roll in from the north. \\n\\nI had a Cuban, it was great. The staff was super nice and inviting, more of a down home feel then the normal server type experience. I like that too. \\n\\nPrices seem fair for the quality. \\n\\nCheck it out.",
        "We now have a favorite mechanic shop!  Had an oil pressure problem in our truck, took it to them and they even found the exhaust leak problem which we knew we had, but Midway Chevrolet and another mechanic said we didn't have!\\n\\nI love Jeff and the guys at Curt's.  They are an honest group and they have not made me feel as if they are out to nickel and dime us.  \\n\\nGreat place!",
        "Great spot in Charlotte!! I live in LA but am in Charlotte about 3 times per year and this is the best thing you guys have going!! I have had robata at Katana on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and at Wolgang Puck's Robata restaurant in Vegas but this place tops them both! Very delicious and creative menu!! I will make Baku a regular stop when I come back to town!",
        "Kouign-amann. Check.\\nCanel\\u00e9. Check.\\nPeet's Coffee. Check.\\nCroque Madame? Oh yeah.\\nPain au chocolat. The bomb!\\n\\nNow Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery has a contender on the west. Worth the drive!",
        "Cadre sympathique, bon service et surtout de bonnes bi\\u00e8res",
        "t's back!  They have moved to the old Blockbuster Space in Quail Corners at 8400-A Park Road..  By far the best Salsarita's location in Charlotte.  (I thought that about the old location as well).  Ingredients are fresh, and the quality is impeccable.",
        "I went back to the Rio to change and get a quick bite, and this place looked safe. Run of the mill as it gets, but the prices are a total joke. It's a burger and fries, for 14 bucks! If I pay 14 bucks for a burger and fries at a walk up joint, it should at least be sufficiently kick ass. Not at all.",
        "Super rip off. Took the car in for an oil change. They recommended $2000+ of \\\"repairs\\\". I left and took it to a mechanic who I trust. All it needed was $230 for brake pads (Firestone wanted $450 for that). Stay away from this place unless you have money you don't want.",
        "I went on a Saturday at lunch not very busy ... Friday I went by for lunch and it was busy with the downtown office people. Service and food was great... got the dragon and volcano rolls very good! And tasty fried dumplings... if I ever find myself in Charlotte again I will return.",
        "Best grilled chicken in Charlotte! Pio Pio!",
        "More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value.",
        "One of my favorite bar/restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I always find a seat at the bar and the service is always great.   The scotch eggs are out of this world!! \\nThe beer selection is outstanding and although I love the scotch eggs .. there are many other menu items that are just mouth watering such as the turkey sandwich with dill mayo.. oh my..   lets go now!\\n\\nLove Pipers Pub!",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "I have been living in Charlotte for two months and am a woman who is very particular about my eyebrows. I took a chance with Elite nail and spa because they were very close to my apartment. WOW! Renee hooked me up. She did a great job on my eyebrows and I have been back twice since. Each time she has not dissappointed. As far as nail services, I do my own but I would definitly go here for their waxing services.",
        "Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town.",
        "My husband purchased a bike from this store for me and it is to big.  They will not let me exchange it, so I will be going to one of the other bike store's in Charlotte that allow you to trade in bikes.    I would recommend the staff not sell a bike if the person who is riding it is not present.  Also, they should have a better exchange program.  I think there customer service is horrible.",
        "Store closed its doors on tax day, 04/15/13 along with the location on East Blvd in Charlotte :(",
        "The Rio is aging, somewhat gracefully. While it's not the best, it's not the worst. One thing I found odd, there is nowhere at the Rio that has a selection of craft draught beers.",
        "this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.",
        "Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\\u00e9s. Portions g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!",
        "This place has amazing burgers, the best onion rings and fries in Charlotte.  If your after a burger check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",
        "I was visiting a friend of mine in Charlotte, and we swung by Menchies. The cutest, sweetest sales girl helped us. So friendly, and legit LOVES her job. Spoke to everyone who walked in. I think her name was Kayla. I will def be back!!!",
        "The value here is outstanding.  They have the tastiest chicken and I'm really baffled by some of the reviewer's who didn't like it.  I lived in Charlotte the past three years and ate here frequently.   The squash casserole and buttered spinach are my favorite sides and the cornbread - YUM!",
        "Excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)",
        "Very good.  Nice staff, good bar food selection and nice space.  I am reluctant to eat at a restaurant in a strip mall BUTTT this place was very good.\\n\\nThe food was good.  Loved the homemade mushroom soup.  The waitress was VERY friendly.  The clientele was relaxed and subtle.  \\n\\nAs I wind down my year in Wisconsin I can definitely say this place is very Wisconsin and for that I appreciate it even more.",
        "Vegetarian or not, your will love this place!\\nThey serve reinvented classics as well as unique vegetarian et vegan dishes. \\nI could pick randomnly anything on the menu and be happy!\\n\\nThe service is not always impeccable, but always very friendly!\\n\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone!",
        "This place has great food. I have never gotten anything that wasn't good. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There salsa is so.... Good it goes  in everything. My favorite is a chicken burro juicy yum.",
        "Decent prices.  $21 for 2 huge sandwiches.  felt like boa constrictors as we left.  Reuben sandwich was good on terrific rye.  Fries excellent!  Mucho smoocho ( yep, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese & special sauce --- it's that kind of place) good, but over-the-moon great.  No wait on a Friday afternoon.  Clearly a family operation -- grandma, teenagers & all.  Nice  change from endless chain restaurants!",
        "Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign.",
        "Went there to play a $5 free slot play coupon through Total Rewards, that I got when I checked in at the Rio. They told me that I had already claimed the free slot play coupon , (I had it in my hand?) I asked them to show me ANY points I accumulated  at that casino, they couldn't because I didn't put 1 dollar in any slot machines. Place is a dump",
        "The best beef tacos in the valley!!! I also love the salsa because it has the right amount of heat. The homemade tortillas are excellent and I always get an order to go. I would give it five stars but the building is a dump. Still love Carolina's though!!!",
        "Seems like a great little breakfast hangout. I tried the Piperrada (pork, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and eggs). This was a good breakfast - everything was tasty and seemed like good quality ingredients.\\n\\nI've heard good things about their pancakes, and I'm definitely interested in trying out several other items on the menu, so I can see myself coming back often.",
        "We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp.  If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it.  I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor.  The fish deserves 5 stars.  Everything else a 3 star.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Would definitely go back.",
        "My husband and I enjoy eating at Noodle Asia.  \\n\\nOne of our favorites we like to order is their pan friend dumplings.  They are huge!  They are filled with pork and vegies.\\n\\nTheir noodle soup, the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well.  I've tried Mama Woo's Spicy noodles soup too and it was great!",
        "The food offerings are above and beyond normal pub fair, more interesting than the typical burgers and fries and also deliciously made. I especially enjoyed the tomato soup made with goat cheese, the goat cheese fritters, and the butternut squash croquettes. They have many local quality beers on draft and the atmosphere is a cozy dark would expect and enjoy from a pub.",
        "Et tu, Hanny's? I can forgive your average food served at room temperature because your environment shows some effort at creating style and life in downtown PHX. However, I can not forgive martini's that are so small they come with itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini's....You lost me at the drinks...",
        "I went for a late lunch - only one other table there.  The rye bread was stale, lean corned beef very dry, fries OK and service very indifferent.  I went out of my way to eat here but will never go back.\\n\\n I had just been in a deli in the Chicago area....now that was a GREAT CB sandwich and service was very pleasant.  Wish they had a Benny and Max's here in Charlotte.",
        "Wow talk about outstanding food and service. This place knows how to top both. My Family and I ate here Wednesday We had such great service \\\"Carlos M\\\" it being our first time eatting  there he was very helpfull on answering our qwestions and offering sudjustions. He was always right there filling our drinks checking on how everything was.",
        "Their fish tacos are the best in Charlotte! SO DELICIOUS! And they always have a great draught selection. I LOVE CABO!",
        "Dinner last night so delicious!  Four of us enjoyed sizzling rice seafood soup, the most savory garlic string beans, tender cashew chicken, beef with black bean sauce and mixed vegetables!  We look forward to trekking back from Mesa soon!  One downside: wait staff were inattentive and careless with serving \\\"over\\\" their guests!",
        "While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!",
        "Location Location Location! Charlotte's great place to have a glass of wine and people watch. Dolce Vita is located in the Queen city best location in town, NODA. Great outdoor seating and good wine selection. Absolutely one of our favorites. 4 thumbs up!",
        "Vraiment excellent! Cuisine raffin\\u00e9e,pr\\u00e9sentation soign\\u00e9e et tr\\u00e8s diff\\u00e9rent de ce qu'on peut manger ailleurs comme tapas. \\u00c0 essayer et adopter!",
        "Definitely needs a major renovation update....! Popcorn ceilings, damp smell upon arrival in room, bedsheet covers are what you will see at great great grandma's house, you get the vibe this place does not feel clean at all, towels are thin & off-white color, parking cost $15 with in & out privileges. The only good things are FREE wi-fi and Lucie at front desk was friendly & informative.",
        "Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.",
        "Love Cafe Rio!!!! Compare to the on on Blue Diamond which is the worst place I've been too. I love going to the one near Ann Rd. The service is fast even when busy, the employees is helpful, nice and they never seem to run out of the queso cheese dip (my daughters favorite... She dips her quesadilla in it).",
        "WOW! ! What a great first time dining experience. Everything from the time I walked into the restaurant was perfect! ! My waiter was spot on with great service and my meal was awesome.  I had the Carolina ribs, I can honestly say they were the best I ever had. Then the manager was nice enough to treat our table to free deserts, I had the home made key lime pie that was as good as I ever had.  I'll be back, thanks for the great meal!#",
        "-Cozy atmosphere in a nice building with great outdoor seating \\n-Server (heavyset black woman) was bad and behaved inappropriately\\n-Food is slightly pricey for some dishes. Flank steak was amazing. Pizza was okay. Nachos were standard fare. Nothing special here.\\n-Girlfriend saw server (slender black lady) use restroom, pick her teeth, and leave restroom without washing hands! This was before we left. Awful!",
        "Above average buffet. My wife and I went for breakfast and had a few good things like egg cooking station and the wide selection of cultural cuisines like Chinese, continental, japanese etc. service was average with a smile. But the quality of food was average and tables were left quite dirty for a long time. Edible but don't take your mama there on mothers day. Maybe take a friend",
        "If I had 30 dollars left and I had a choice of buying a pizza pie or going to marquee, I would choose the pizza life everyday. Shoutout to the grandmas out there. \\n\\nThis place is spot for a pricey oily slice of indulgent vegas goodness.",

        "One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool",

        "Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta.",
        "Besides pizzerias, this is one of our favorite kid friendly places to eat while in Mesa, AZ. The burgers, fries and shakes just hit the spot (like In n Out back home). The seating situation at this location is way better than the location in Mesa, AZ.",
        "Their tamales are so good! I miss their breakfast burritos and street tacos as well. Everything is so flavorful and well seasoned. It's the best Mexican food in Mesa by far and I highly recommend it. The only thing to remember is that it's closed on Sundays.",
        "Very good authentic Cuban food. Wish the place was a bit busier as I would like to see them succeed. We had a marvelous meal and the waitress was very helpful. We will go back as it is on our minds constantly.",
        "Fuck this place. No bread served before the meals and the portions are TINY! Italian, by tradition, is served in generous portions, but these meals were so small that my girlfriend, her mom, and her grandma were all left ready for another helping. And it's EXPENSIVE.  For what it is.  Would NOT come back.  I almost laughed when the waitress offered dessert because I hadn't felt like I even had dinner. Headed to Wingstop now."

My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",

I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",

Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!",

The only down side is they are not by my house.",

The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",

        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "The food was good a bit overpriced but whatever. The problem was the service the lady working at the register was unfriendly and unresponsive. I had ordered the green salad instead of the Mac salad but instead she gave me the Mac salad. I told her it was wrong and rudely she said it would be 50\\u00a2 more. Waited 20 minutes then just left. The lady that works there is brain dead.",

I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!",
        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",
        "Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
        "Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service",
        "A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. \\n\\nThere are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.",
        "I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame. \\n\\nI could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!",

        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",
        "We stayed here for a couple of nights.  Since it was the middle of the week, we had a sweet deal.  Thankfully we were in a floor that was fairly quiet, as well as being well off from the elevators.  The room was nice and clean, albeit starting to show a little wear and tear.  Staff was really nice and our kids loved swimming in nearly all of the pools.  Would definitely stay here again.  It was a really nice way to start off our vacation.",
        "My previous review was very harsh, but true.  I met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect.  I have had nothing but poor service previously, but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter.  So, I'm upping the stars, hopefully the service keeps improving.",
        "ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!",
        "Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  \\nHad to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever.",
        "Tried to eat lunch here today.  Was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up.  Waited for a half hour with no service.  Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training.",
        "Everything is good. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Mole =)",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.",

        "We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.",
        "This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.",
        "Seated and forgotten on a Saturday night. Servers looking bored. How about, check you table? Jeez...",
        "I'm writing this at the bar at BRI. I just finished the stacked enchilada. So very good!! It was pretty spicy but not in an overwhelming way. Super tasty!! \\n\\nThe other night I had the Spanglish sandwich. That was another huge winner!! \\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty good too!\\n\\nYou should check this spot out!",
        "Well we had guest from Texas in so v we tool them to the lake to see the area. We stop to eat and waited for 20 minutes for someone to seat us. They would look and just go with there own selfs. I ask should we sit down and was told no. Well finally I said that's it we left and drove 2 miles to tortilla flats and was seated right away and they were packed. Never agian will I go to canyon lake to eat .",
        "The valet service is good but flawed, Sunday wait for your car after checkout was around 30min(as I was told), I waited over an hour because they lost my car and brought it to a different tower",
        "Waited almost 2 hours for food. One server for about 11 tables. Poor thing was running like crazy. First batch of chips we got were cooked in so much leftover oil they tasted like old oil. Second round was better. By the time we got our food we just had a packed up so we could leave. No drink refills. However very nice folks. I may give it one more chance just because of how nice the owners were.",
        "Great rooms but that's all. First we have been moved to another room the second night ruining our morning. Barbara at the front desk was rude and unhelpful and made us get crazy to solve a problem they caused! They also messed with our players card and we never saw coffee and newspapers included in the suite price! A beautiful setting ruined by the attitude of the employees.. Will never book it again!",
        "Enjoyed the ambiance here when I passed through for a book launch shortly before the holidays. Ideal for a literary evening, or for a conversation with a well-suited friend at the bar, the space feels like it's tucked with decor brought home from long travels. Hints of Havana and East India in the 1950s when the light is just right. I only had a beer but glanced over the cocktail menu and would be curious to return.",
        "Not just coffee, but don't forget the tea!  Great loose leaf blends and knowledgeable staff to coach on steeping times and the varieties.  They could even cite the amount of caffeine in each. Very impressive.... cannot wait to try the coffee.",
        "Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \\n\\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\\n\\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)",
        "My two favorite restaurants in the world are Alfredo's in Rome and Commanders Palace in New Orleans.  Sadly, Commander's Palace recently closed.  Thankfully, I discovered Lola's!  Amazing Cajun food.  The catfish and grits is the absolute best I've ever had anywhere. The staff is great and you just can't find better food in Vegas.  Way to go Lola!",
        "Worst Golden Corral ever! I have been to many Golden Corrals in my travels have never been to an horrible restaurant such as this. \\n Food wasn't the best! Flies were in the restaurant. Lots of dirty plant mixed in with clean ones. Everyone was sick after of visit. The one in Victorville was awesome but, this one sucked ass!",
        "Waited 10 min at airport for shuttle to arrive.  Waited 15 min to load the bus in a leisurely and surly fashion.  Waited 10 min after bus was full, not sure why.  What would have been an 8 min taxi  ride took over an hour with all the stops.  And we only saved $5 for the two of us compared to a taxi.  Just say no to Slowtime.",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Had to give the spot 4 stars... The place is cool the food is good & the price is Right :D plus its @ my Casino. SouthPoint :D perfect spot to chill, grub, burger, shake did I say chill? You gotta try it...",
        "Not cheap @ $4.50 for a cheese slice and $24 for a whole pie. But definitely tasty. Even when you're not that hungry, so that says something! LOL  Will definitely try other menu items next time I return!",
        "The checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked. No ventilation, as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room. Then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places. Not recommended.",
        "Probably my favorite Apple Store besides the one at San Tan Village. Everyone at this location has always been helpful. I've purchased two laptops here and was always offered advice and suggestions for what I was planning on using them for. Only complaint is about the repair prices which seem extremely high in comparison to some third party retailers.",
        "Great location to watch a summer storm roll in from the north. \\n\\nI had a Cuban, it was great. The staff was super nice and inviting, more of a down home feel then the normal server type experience. I like that too. \\n\\nPrices seem fair for the quality. \\n\\nCheck it out.",
        "nope.  I was planning on purchasing a pair of boots, and had to interrupt two employees who were too busy chatting to notice I was the only customer in the boutique and wanted to try them on.  the assistant who brought them out was completely dismissive until she realized I was a serious buyer.  she then tried to push the pair off on me even though they were obviously ill-fitting at the ankle... about 10 minutes too late.",
        "Had my wind shield replaced and it leaked water through the seal and shorted out electronics in dash. They replaced the seal the next day, they damaged molding on drivers side of car. Josh at head quarters spoke to local guy, local guy said they would call me to get it fixed. Its been 2 weeks and no one has contacted me ... Stay away from them, spend the extra money to get it done right the first time.....",
        "Was here a couple of weeks ago for a Gammage Goers event. Love this cute little place right on Mill Avenue! The bruschetta was tasty and a good price for the quantity! The service was really slow (we waited around 15 minutes for the check), I think because it was St. Patrick's Day she was a bit overwhelmed, but I definitely want to go back to try more items. Especially their Sangria. ;)",
        "good service during a late lunch. Food was good, and heat level was spot on. good portions. the meat is clearly cooked on the side, then mixed into whatever dish you order, so the meat can be blad or had an odd flavor. Still good, and would put it on my short list of thai spots...there are TONS of thai places here",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "Well the chips and salsa were good while it lasted now been waiting 15 minutes for refills on our sodas and chips. I had to get up and find our server just to get those and he seemed upset that I even asked. Waiting on our food order to come which was taken about 20 more minutes. Oh did I mention we waited for a table for 25 minutes when they said 10 then we get shoved in the corner with a loud family blehh",
        "Dutch Bros is a place that I forget I love until someone surprises me with a drink from there. When I lived next door at Cholla, I took advantage of their free drinks when they first opened up. Hadn't been back in awhile, but a friend picked up an Almond Joy the other day and I fell in love all over again.",
        "I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.",

        "Had breakfast here meeting my sister that I hadn't seen in years... Was a little worried at first with it being so busy ... Let's just say the wait was well worth it...

        "Best Buffet I've been to in Vegas so far, but that's not really saying much seeing that I've only been to a couple.  They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF / Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent.",
        "brunch only until 1PM on sunday and noon on Saturday?  is it just my spoiled Chicago self, or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch?",
        "I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.",
        "Beautiful, well crafted Italian clothes and shoes, all at fair prices. I always seem to visit while they're having their summer sale, so I usually walk away with some fantastic deals. This visit was no exception! My boyfriend treated me to an adorable blue dress, and some smokin' gold snakeskin shoes. There are only two stores in the U.S., so be sure to pay Fornarina a visit while you're in Vegas!",
        "I've heard a lot of people say Central is the best coffee in the city and I do think they're on to something here.  I haven't been disappointed.  Awesome lattes and their housemade quiche is cheesy, fresh, and delicious. Also, the employees seem to know their stuff and are friendly and welcoming.",

        "The pizza is great here, my family and I have been here more times than I can count but tonight we walked out because of the terrible service.  We were promptly seated and the place was not really busy with plenty of staff.  We waited more than 10 minutes without anyone coming to our table, really disappointed because we love this place.",
        "Good healthy eats where everything is organic.  But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive.  I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for.  It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater.  Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about $15 for only 2 small tacos.",
        "My son and I had lunch at the Cubs game and was sadly disappointed. We both had the Pita Tri Tip and waited 26 minutes after we ordered for some stale bread and three small shavings of meat. When done eating, my son asked if I enjoyed my bread and onion sandwich.",
        "Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order.

If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.",

        "Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \\n\\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.

        "The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!",
        "Sub par.  Too expensive for too little mediocre food.  Not likely to return.  Beans are soupy and taste like dish water, better suited for a straw than fork.  Salsa is horrible.  One small mediocre enchilada for $10.  Sat on patio which was very nice.  Staff not at all attendant, such as soda glass was empty for more than 5 minutes with them frequently walking by.  Finally after waiting almost 10 minutes asked for and got my check.",
        "We stopped in for breakfast and found the restaurant to be fairly empty.  They were pushing their \\\"specials\\\" pretty hard, and while they looked good, I choose to stick with something else.  \\n\\nIt did appear as if we might have been a little forgotten about, but the server was very pleasant and apologized.  \\n\\nOverall it was a very nice experience with good portions and good food.",
        "I'm not sure I get the appeal of this place.  It's like Main Street in Disneyland only it has a Pottery Barn.\\n\\nPeople seem to like to bring their dogs here and it seems to be a community gathering place for Green Valley.  But I'd rather hang out somewhere a little more urban.",
        "Great food and great service. The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!",
        "Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."

The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.",

        "Pinky's is a great place to stop for breakfast, or to grab a quick sandwich. The prices are good, and the service is friendly. It's the perfect place to take your really picky nephew who won't eat anything but grilled cheese or spaghetti... because they have something that he will eat.",
        "Very nice meal.  The lobster bisque is really TO DIE FOR!  The lobster Surf n Turf is the Business!  I also had an order of crab legs with the filet, however not as tasty as the lobster for sure!  Wonderful restaurant! Loved the lay-out and decor!",
        "This place never disappoints when it comes to quick fresh food. I never feel like a disgusting slob full of grease leaving Wahoo's. They have a dish for everyone including vegetarians. The Decor is really cool with the walls being covered in Action Sports memorabilia.  There's also tv's everywhere for the sports fanatics.",
        "The girly drink I had was sooooo good! \\n\\nI would pick Sierra Gold over Blue Martini any day! Half off pizzas and drinks for $3? Im game!",
        "Not bad for if you're looking for some quick take out. Nothing good or bad to say. Just your standard strip mall take out place.",
        "Randy back in the hitch install bay is great. After another shop torqued my hitch down to 120ft lbs (really?!?!?!) he was quick to get it right and ease my mind. Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!",
        "Love our family YMCA, the new teen center is also very cool since they have Pac Man, the original. Yes, I move kids out of the way to play LOL",
        "I filled my ample belly with OJ, fresh cantaloupe, ambrosia, easy over eggs, corned beef hash and a tiny spoonful of bread pudding.  Overall, I felt this buffet has slipped a notch since our last visit.",
        "I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \\\"b+\\\" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice.",
        "This place is a lot of fun even if you are not a Kiss fan. Play minature golf indoors where the black lights make eveything glow. Play a variety of arcade games and browse the gift shop. Fun for the whole family.",
        "Tastes like home made! Better in some cases.. \\nThe tortillas tasted absolutely amazing, the carne asada was great. You gotta try the breakfast burritos. Customer service was great, our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas.",
        "It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!",
        "Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  \\n\\nAnd definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.\\n\\nI'll be back again!!",
        "The food is good but if your eating in the bar bring a fan - it is way to hot - there is no AC - pathetic",
        "Great martinis and cocktails in general.\\nThe bartenders are also sup[er sweet, so be nice to them.",
        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again.",
        "This is your typical greasy spoon place. A run down resto that has amazing hot dogs, fries and poutine. Not a classy place but a great spot for a quick bite.",
        "In town for quick meeting. Yelped and found Rony. Great guy, great place, great recommendations. If I wasn't in Orange County, this would be my weekly spot!!!  The service is unsurpassed and the price is a deal!!!",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)",
        "Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.",
        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "We just left and let me tell you, atmosphere was not good. Mainly caused by other patrons; in particular a group of women who were extremely loud and one who cackles.  We moved to the back of the restaurant to escape but the sound carried...  Food was above average, so we'll give it another try. Surf n turf roll was a little salty. I hope the ladies stick to joints were you might bring a colicky baby -- those with inherent background noise.",
        "Pizza is ok for a quick bite but the service is very slow.",
        "Quick and tasty Chicken Sandwches. Nothing special",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",
        "I love this place! They have great gas prices and friendly staff. The lines are long but they go quick. The baggers are extremely helpful and always go above and beyond.",
        "Front staff annoyed me. They have about 3 girls they look like they're 16 or 17. Have no customer service skills or communication skills. I asked her a simple question about the open bar she had no fucking idea how to answer my question. Security guard total asshole. Not to mention they only accept cash.",
        "I love this place!!! My husband and I claimed this to be our quick fix for dinner options!!",
        "Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "Here's the quick and dirty. I can see how some people may like it here. However if you've ever had a real crepe this place won't do it for you. The toppings are very standard although they have lots, it's all sweet or sweeter nothing really exciting or new happening here.",
        "ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!",
        "Second time coming here this week-delicious! I love the topping selection, how QUICK they cook your pizzas (I have a short lunch break), and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on. Yum!",
        "I didn't think I liked Carrot Top, but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show.  I am so glad I did!  It was hilarious.  A must see in Vegas!",
        "Reallllly good sandwiches,  i love this place, just had a bad encounter with the owner one time though. Ive seen the guy on several occassions and he is nice,but this one time he basically borderline disrespected me....ugh I hate that because it has left with me with  a foul taste in my mouth for the place. HOWEVER --- I can't resist. I love this freaking place...",
        "Been there many times and have not been disappointed by the BBQ. Only been open for a short time but has won many awards and \\\"best of\\\" contests. Travel Channel has already spotlighted them! Be prepared to wait in line. The quickest I have made it through getting my food is about 40 minutes. Despite the wait, it is still a 5 star join.",
        "Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!",
        "Very friendly staff. Food is cheap like any fast-food chinese restaraunt. The portions are huge for the lunch and dinner specials. The veggies are fresh just the right crunch. The food is better than the more expensive chinese restaraunts. Dissapointed with the egg rolls and the soups though. They can use some improvement but overall a quick and easy decision.",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "This is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station.  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",

        "Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous.",
        "My husband and I needed new screens and batteries for our cell phones.  They were quick to fix the issues and we felt the prices were reasonable.   The store itself is a little hidden.  It's located upstairs in case anyone gets lost!",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Stopped in for breakfast about 9:00 AM on a Monday.  It was not crowded.  The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP - tasty.  The noise level in this place was awful.  The music (50's music) was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers.  Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did.",
        "Absolutely horrible.  Did take out chopped salad was not worth $11.00.  Small portion and the pizza was ice cold and was like as thin as a piece of paper maybe 3 pieces of the schrieners chicken sausage on it.  Pathetic.  $30 for that meal Are you kidding me. My girlfriend and I arent even full.  We had to go get more food.  Never ever go back.  Get your shit together!!",
        "Great performances and acts! The main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate. I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "It wasn't spectacular... Started 10-15 minutes late... The Comedian was the highlight of this show... I'm still googling her youtube videos with no luck... Some girls were really pretty but they weren't in sync much...",

        "I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.",
        "This is located conveniently next to the hard rock hotel. When they say everything is bigger in Vegas, they aren't kidding. This cvs was huge and had everything you could possibly need. The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \\nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open.",
        "I love the bread pudding and the soup.  But the prices are high, not open on Sunday, and I was not impressed with the breakfast.",
        "Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty.",
        "Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos.",
        "If you want some quick, affordable, and tasty chinese take-out in Tempe than this place is reliable.  I've only been coming here for a short time now and never had any problems.  Just don't have any high expectations for something less than 6-7 dollars for a meal and you'll arrive home happy and full.",
        "Terrible! The food is terrible. Like really terrible. Everything tastes like fish.  How do you manage to make a chicken quesadilla taste like fish?  That shouldn't even be possible.\\nService was so slow.  Took forever to get a menu, order, and get food.\\nAnd it's fucking cold in there. I didn't come to the desert to have rock hard nipples from how cold I am.",
        "Not bad pizza for an airport quick bite. Line was quick. Seating was not plenty, but was able to grab spot right away.",
        "Good price on full synthetic oil change and its quick and easy and got my tires rotated for free.  Need some other things done they said but seemed a little spendy.",

        "Service is a bit slow, factor that in if you are stopping for a quick drink before a movie..",
        "Excellent service. I've used ShowTime for my last 4 trips to Vegas, and they were okay... long wait, packed shuttle. I was pleasantly surprised by how quick the SuperShuttle van arrived, how helpful and friendly the driver was and how quickly I got to my hotel. I will use SuperShuttle from now on! Definitely worth the few extra bucks the fare cost for the easy, stress-free ride to my hotel. Started my vacation off on an excellent note!",
        "Might be the fanciest car wash I have ever been to!! \\nEveryone was super friendly, they did a great job cleaning my car, and they were quick! \\nWould totally recommend this place to anyone!",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",
        "Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass, described my needs, and received a prompt response with a quote (within a couple hours). \\n\\nEasy pick up during regular business hours. I was showed how to use the equipment and it was loaded into my car. Equipment was easy to set up during our event and the sound quality was great! Quick and simple return. Will definitely use them again!",
        "Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat- great value. Staff very friendly, and kind. Service was moderately quick. Go there in the early hours of meal time to get the best service times.\\nWARNING- don't order too much of the rolls- they have huge servings.",
        "Andrea is professional and efficient--as painless as a wax can be.  It's easy to set an appointment with her and she is always quick to respond to my texts.  I've been going to her for over a year and think her service is great. Pricing is reasonable and oftentimes you can get a groupon!   I highly recommend her to others.",
        "Very expensive but very good Chinese food. The service is fast and friendly. The food is cooked immediately and is out in minutes. On a slow day, you can see the chefs watching you eat just to make sure they didnt screw it up. If you're willing to spend the extra dough, then go here. The lines can get long though, but they move people in and out rather quick.",
        "Yummy, quick lunch! This is our go-to local Chinese restaurant. It has been consistently good over the past 4-5 years we have been living here. We especially like their luncheon specials and to go dinners. We love their mu shu chicken/pork and their wonton soup.",
        "I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience",
        "Never knew how big the place was. Seems like an awesome place for sporting events. I didn't get any drinks, but the specials appear good. It was freaking dead in there, but I want to try and go on a busy night for further review.",
        "$13.98 prime rib in the middle of the Strip.  Great deal when you consider a simple turkey sandwich could cost more than that across the street at the Bellagio or Caesars.  Nice menu, quick service.  Not very large, so I imagine there would be a wait at busy times.  I was there on a Monday night off season.",
        "Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?",

Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",

        "Warning - I got quite possible the WORST case of food poisoning I've ever had at this place. I am 100% sure it's this place because it's the only thing I had eaten all day - I'm here for CES. I got the Ruben and I thought something was weird about the sauce but attributed it to shitty Vegas food. Going on 12 hours sick. :(",
        "Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back.",
        "This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.",

        "Don't stay here. The room was in poor condition upon check-in. The restroom smelled like someone took a massive dump. The sheet was stained red which I am hoping is from cranberry juice. Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",

Waited in SPG line for over 20 minutes to check in. Ridiculous. Got to room and change immediately. Wifi was horrible as well. There is not one good thing about this hotel. I'm here for business and its been a long time since I've seen something this bad.",

        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "This place never disappoints when it comes to quick fresh food. I never feel like a disgusting slob full of grease leaving Wahoo's. They have a dish for everyone including vegetarians.

Never will I go back to this place.",

        "Totally disappointing, especially after dinner at SW the night before. \\n\\nEverything was pretty average. The short rib was one of the worst I have had. \\n\\nService was decent, but would have liked to have enjoyed the food. ;(",
        "I went here with a Meet-up group and had a great experience. The food, service and atmosphere was terrific! We all enjoyed ourselves and will return.",
        "Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.",
        "This is a fantastic small hair salon. I have been going here for years and they are experts. You always feel valued and always have great service (and a GREAT cut too!).\\nThe ambiance is superb- small, quaint, and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this caliber.\\n\\nI highly recommend!!!",
        "RUDE,RUDE,RUDE is all I can say about this place. If you want to be treated like dirt, this is the place for you. I went in there ro shop and rexeived the worst customer service I have ever receives anywhere. Snooty lady at the register was clearly inconvenienced by my being there and didn't want to help with one simple question I had about a scarf for my daughter. I definately won't shop there again.",
        "I am sorry but this show was just plain BOOORING, the big fat stupid baby is just lame, the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny. \\nDont think im not a Cirque fan because I am, I loved KA and Zumanity, but Mystere is just overated, skip it.\\nVery blah.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.",
        "It's gross in here...cobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthy..and how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat bread..and very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere...",
        "I am from Chicago,IL and I travel all over the states for my business, this is the worst Korean BBQ ever. The food was old and chewy and the service was very poor.They literally charged for lettuce they said it was extra, the side dishes were about five and when we asked for refill they were reluctant and not cooperative.Don't go to this place unless it is free.Big disappointment they also use gas instead of charcoal.",
        "The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)",
        "Very clean for a robertos very fast.  Food was amazing I have been to other robertos and they were filthy and slow..",
        "I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\\n\\nI will never go back there again.",
        "This place is overrated.  It was fine but not at all special, not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good.  Sorry.\\n\\nConsidering how many great restaurants there are in Vegas, there is no reason to come here.",
        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",
        "Worst mistake of my life. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. These are the worst \\\"students\\\" ever. I'm sure I'd be more comfortable having a monkey work on my teeth.",
        "Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.",
        "Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.",

        "Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  \\nHad to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever.",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "No doubt that the coffee was excellent- but the barista was rude and very cantankerous, despite attempts at being friendly. Not to mention the bathroom was out of toilet paper and just had a sign that said 'sorry- public bathrooms available down the street'. I wish I could give a better review since their coffee is great- but the experience was lackluster.",
        "Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.",
        "By far the worst and most overpriced pizza I've ever experienced.  If you want pizza just like this but want to get away cheap, buy the pizza from Sam's Club. Seriously.  I'm from NY and this is NOT what you find on the \\\"streets of NY.\\\"",
        "This place was probably the worst service I have ever had. Everything I ordered came out wrong, and the girl that took my order was super rude. I will for sure not be going back to this location.",
        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "Great performances and acts! The main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate. I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again",
        "Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.",
        "Worst meal ever. Everything I ordered was bad and it was really expensive. The Latte I ordered was cold and she ended up microwaving it instead of making me a new one. The Tar Tar was gross. Eek! Methinks not.",
        "Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty.",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "Had the worse nail experience here. I asked for a nail trim and a fill. The woman cut off some of my skin said \\\"sorry\\\" and passed me off to someone else. Wtf?! Definitely not going back!",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "The worst Korean BBQ I have ever been, not too much choice u can really eat, also they serve some Chinese& Japanese food, wt the hell!!!!!! It's not a real Korean BBQ. Also let's talk abt the price I walked in by myself, order a ice tea to drink, total for me is $28!!!!",
        "I thank God i got the tickets for free. Otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in Vegas. The women were hott, but the overall performance was really bad. They tried to mix in comedy and singing as well. Just horrible show. I did see only three couples walk out.",
        "Terrible service, terrible food quality and horrifying prices!  Seriously folks you can eat at PF Changs and have far better food, service and pay 1/3 of the cost!  Truly the worst Hot & Sour Soup and Mongolian Beef I have ever tasted, in fact I could only eat a tiny portion of each.  Steve Wynn should be ashamed of himself!",
        "If you want hepatitis this is a place where you can get it! Totally disgusting from the food to the restaurant and the waiters. This whole place should be bombed with RAID!",
        "Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back.",
        "So I was excited to try a new place. I loved the country music but that is about all. After being seated at a very wet table I sat for almost 10 minutes and was never greeted by a waitress. Many walked by me, but no one stopped to say hello. So my husband and I left.  Will never be back. Sorry. I love to support my Chandler restaurants, but that was horrible service.",
        "Stay away!!!! This AAA approved shop made me cancel my membership after the experience that I received from these guys.\\nThe worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Will not honor their warranty and will tow your vehicle if you try to dispute their work. Their service clerks are RUDE, unprofessional, and misinformed nit wits.",
        "I Love Akahana! I think most people don't realize it exists because it is located in a small shopping center beside a little bookstore in Plaza Midwood, but if you've never been and love shush, this is the place to be. They always have buy one get one free specials, tasty drinks and tons of fun rolls to choose from.",
        "You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing.",
        "This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled",
        "Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!",
        "Guy who did my nails did a horrible job. They looked awful. He seemed to be in a hurry and it showed. Definitely the worst full set I've ever had. This place is always too crowded and loud.",
        "Very expensive but very good Chinese food. The service is fast and friendly. The food is cooked immediately and is out in minutes. On a slow day, you can see the chefs watching you eat just to make sure they didnt screw it up. If you're willing to spend the extra dough, then go here. The lines can get long though, but they move people in and out rather quick.",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",
        "Horrible service! I ordered $145 worth of pastries and they overcharged me with sansrival that I never ordered. I called them to have them remove the charge, and the supervisor said, they can't refund the charge! Worst guest service ever!",
        "blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM",
        "This has to be the worst cupcake I've ever tasted. I've had better cupcakes from the grocery store. every thing is over priced (even for Vegas). But I will say that the shakes are good.",
        "Worst food terrible service and was forced to listen to the worst music ever created by a live singer hired to torture our ears\\nI could not wait to get out of here.\\n\\nIf there were negative stars for this review\\nIt would be warranted",
        "I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\\n\\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!",

        "Worst Golden Corral ever! I have been to many Golden Corrals in my travels have never been to an horrible restaurant such as this. \\n Food wasn't the best! Flies were in the restaurant. Lots of dirty plant mixed in with clean ones. Everyone was sick after of visit. The one in Victorville was awesome but, this one sucked ass!",
        "Skaters beware,  this is a communist park ran by racist people who don't like skaters.  This place had ridiculous rules that constantly change.  Be very careful, if someone there doesn't like you ,  they will kick you out.   Don't waste your time or money here...   sucks sucks sucks sucks.  Including the staff!",
        "I wish I could give them 10 stars. The service is always top notch and I love the Chimi's",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time."

Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.",

        "A terrible company.. Went to get business cards for my new small business..talked to Travis the graphic designer about what I wanted and he seemed like he was happy to help but now a month later and after multiple calls I have heard no response..should change their name from Never Late to Never Received",

        "Good place to watch a game, but I would never go there for anything else.  The menu is totally sports-bar-esque and the food was greasy.  Good place if you're hungover and want to watch the game.  Otherwise... ummm... no thanks.",
        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",
        "This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",
        "Worst experience!\\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\\nNever going back.",
        "Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \\\"all-you-can eat\\\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",
        "I don't see the difference from the Fitzgerald.  Actually, one of their openings has a D Las Vegas banner and the other opening still says Fitzgerald's.  The casino floor still looks the same and not really impressive.  I definitely understand that the place is continuing a huge renovation so i will just leave it at that.  Hopefully when I revisit this place, my rating changes for the better.",

From decoration to menu, it was all a snore.\\nI dont usually use how busy a dining floor is to judge how good a restaurant is, but when we were here, the place was completely empty, so i'm positive I wasnt the only person that was bored with this place.",
        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",

Waited in SPG line for over 20 minutes to check in. Ridiculous. Got to room and change immediately. Wifi was horrible as well. There is not one good thing about this hotel. I'm here for business and its been a long time since I've seen something this bad.",

I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",

I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",
        "Very slow...and there's not very many people.   Didn't bring food for two people.   When we asked why they said the cooked accidentally closed our order.   No real apologies.  Food ok but not worth the lack of service.",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it.",
        "Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!",
        "Circus Circus has not changed much since 1995, except that the buffet is $15.95 now instead of $4.95 back then!  The decor is stuck in the 1980's and the rooms are, unfortunately worse, with wildly circus-themed decors.  Much better choices!",

They have a roll topped with a coconut shrimp that is very tasty.  Also enjoyed the $5 bombers that were on special for Halloween.",
        "GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees. The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!",
        "I had the sausage pizza and thought it was great. I think the menu described it as a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the sausage is from Chicago, but this is not deep dish. Actually pretty thin. But I definitely liked it and would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. I was there too late for it, but they were advertising half off pizza during the late afternoon.",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",

        "It was pretty much what I expected except for the mermaids. Kind of a let down not to see them but still nice to see and very relaxing to sit next to with the pro shop waterfall in the background. Overall it was a nice change from the overcrowded strip for a change.",

        "My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",
        "After the manager read my review he contact me and apologized. I have yet to return to the place, but the manager assured me my experience will be different. Since then the server that served me was terminated. Looking forward to going again.",
        "I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner.",
        "We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks. I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot. Order it! So delicious!\\n\\nNeed to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome.",
        "Love this place. It's great for all ages, and don't get me started on how comfortable the beds are. The service is fast and very responsive.",
        "The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.",
        "I like it. I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant. And they have a few things on the menu you don't see everywhere else, and its all delicious. I dream about their pumpkin curry!",
        "Received an email from the owner of the restaurant,  who states they are still open and it was a competitor across the street that closed. I don't live in Montreal so I can't confirm,  but my apologies to the proprietor. I wish I had found your restaurant as I was very much in the mood for sushi that night. Perhaps some better signage might be in order?",
        "We like to go here for Tapas happy hour!  Fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharing.\\n\\nIt's a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza (there's a kid's menu).  \\n\\nService is usually pretty good.",
        "Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.",
        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",
        "Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead.",
        "Went looking for a Sonoran Dog and heard this place had a Phoenix Dog that was close to a Sonoran Dog. It was further then I use go for food but closest place with a Sonoran Dog. It was YUMMY!!! So were the onion rings. Not over priced either. The hot dogs are all beef and deep fried. Very clean and nice services.",
        "Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",
        "We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.",
        "Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!",
        "Tried to eat lunch here today.  Was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up.  Waited for a half hour with no service.  Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training.",
        "Sticker. Sticker. Sticker.\\n\\nSticker shock when I saw the bill!\\n\\nThank goodness it wasn't my turn. Lol. \\n\\nEverything was good. It's in a decent location, to where they can change you premium solely for location, but it's definitely a delight. \\n\\nEverything was delicious. The service was exceptional. \\n\\nWould definitely dine again.",
        "Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning",
        "Great service, quality, taste, and atmosphere.\\n\\nThe problem is that its way too expensive and not enough food.  I know, I know its vegas, joel robuchon, french, blah blah blah.  At least fill me up.  btw i got the chefs tasting menu and ate a bunch of bread.",
        "Considering the hype about this place, I will admit that I went into this meal with high expectations.  There are lots of menu options and you can customize your burger experience.  It just didn't live up to all the hype.  Without the hype, this place gets 4 stars, but if you go in hoping for a better-than-average burger you won't be disappointed.",
        "Pretty good area! Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat. Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.\\n\\nI prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.",
        "Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty.",
        "Very nice place especially at Caesar's Palace. This was my first time trying dining at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection was huge.",
        "went here for the first time & I have to say I was satisfied with their food. we ordered the chicken & beef bulgogi and grilled saury, they were all really delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars for the food & atmosphere alone, but I had to take one star off for slow service & some dishes on the menu are a bit over priced.",
        "In vegas, every restaurant is pretty good... but N9NE does it better with little things... things like the best atmostphere, a simple menu where they focus on things they can do well, smores, one of the best and freshest seafood platters I've ever had, etc. etc.",
        "Food is good but make sure to ask for easy sauce. All their dishes come with globs of sauce that is at the bottom of the bowl. There is no other rice bowl places is this area besides YC's. Gave 3 star because like YC's better and food comes with too much sauce. Will return but won't venture far into their menu besides ordering the teriyaki chicken bowl.",
        "I bring all my nice clothes that never get worn which I've bought within a year & they always give me a huge chunk of change. I'm very happy, this is the only placed I have spent money on clothes in years. I always find exactly what I want & come home with amazing clothes, even in my shoe size!!!",
        "We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.",
        "The Downtown Dill is my favorite cocktail! This place is the most amazingly chill cocktail bar I've ever had the pleasure of being to. They have a number of great cocktails for you to expand your tastes with. I've never had a bad drink at DCR and I've pretty much tried most of the menu. The bartenders are also extremely friendly and personable!",
        "Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.",
        "I bought a groupon to try this place out.  I'm not impressed with the wait as I was told half hour and it's been over an hour.  And there were upcharges.  Surprise.....so my 35 dollar oil change and car wash turned into an extra 32 dollars.  Won't be back.  The help was nice but still not returning.",
        "Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.",
        "I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good.",
        "Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources.",
        "Ambiance is a 5! Quiet and away from the bustle of E Carson St. BDC occupies the ground floor of a renovated row house. Tables are scattered over many rooms and an inviting outdoor deck. BDC serves Inteligensia coffee (like 21st Street). Oatmeal and gelato are also menu highlights.",

        "Terrible! The food is terrible. Like really terrible. Everything tastes like fish.  How do you manage to make a chicken quesadilla taste like fish?  That shouldn't even be possible.\\nService was so slow.  Took forever to get a menu, order, and get food.\\nAnd it's fucking cold in there. I didn't come to the desert to have rock hard nipples from how cold I am.",
        "Good price on full synthetic oil change and its quick and easy and got my tires rotated for free.  Need some other things done they said but seemed a little spendy.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",
        "So after the billet bar finally closed Bar 350 popped up and I hoped they would get away from the wannabe biker bar that billet was and the wannabe crowd that always hung out there.  Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.",
        "Forget the tablecloth-and-white-glove joints. I walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu, but was even more impressed with the healthy options available. I had an omelet and wheat toast, and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm - and I'm not a small guy.",
        "Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine.",
        "Food = mehh, service = subpar, what else is there to say? \\nSave your money. You'll be happy you did.\\n\\nI know i'm asking for Tina to stalk and insult me on Yelp by posting this bad review, but Tina, the truth shall set you free. You can choose to accept it and change your restaurant's operating policies, or you can ignore everyone and struggle to make things work."

        "Probably one of the best steaks in Las Vegas. Comfortable seating and busy. Very busy. Lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little, but delicious amount you got. For a new restuarant the staff was very well trained. Looking forward to next visit, minus lobster app.",

        "Good food the creamy mermaids are awesome as long as you don't get the old man that's always drunk and if he's sober he's incredibly rude will ignore you and plan to wait a long time to eat if he's your sushi chef. He's a nightmare not a nice guy but the waitresses were pleasant. Just a shame you have to deal with him.",
        "A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.  Their breakfast sausage was also outstanding.  Boy do I wish that they would distribute nationally like Fra Mani does.  Business would grow exponentially.  This place is absolutely outstanding.  Service is great, too!",
        "I was charged $130 for a $60 tire, $20 for $10 tire tape, and $20 to put the tire on the rim. Outrageous",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "I am from Los Angeles, and this place is the closest to quality of LA. Mexican food I've found.",
        "Loved the atmosphere, excellent music, very cool patrons and staff.  The seaweed salad was excellent!",
        "Very nice meal.  The lobster bisque is really TO DIE FOR!  The lobster Surf n Turf is the Business!  I also had an order of crab legs with the filet, however not as tasty as the lobster for sure!  Wonderful restaurant! Loved the lay-out and decor!",
        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "It was pretty much what I expected except for the mermaids. Kind of a let down not to see them but still nice to see and very relaxing to sit next to with the pro shop waterfall in the background. Overall it was a nice change from the overcrowded strip for a change.",
        "We just left and let me tell you, atmosphere was not good. Mainly caused by other patrons; in particular a group of women who were extremely loud and one who cackles.  We moved to the back of the restaurant to escape but the sound carried...  Food was above average, so we'll give it another try. Surf n turf roll was a little salty. I hope the ladies stick to joints were you might bring a colicky baby -- those with inherent background noise.",
        "This place gets only 1star as well because of the waitress was nice. One of the hostess as we walked in was rude and did not even smile. I commented for her to smile, the more she gave me this dagger look. We were excited about this new place but with what happened, it will be a while for the next visit.",

        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "Oh No!!!! \\nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy.

        "Ordered a Vogue Burger to go and after a little debacle with the hostess thinking I wanted to order beer to go, I was seated, served a beer while waiting, and ten minutes later  walking out the door. The burger was amazing and one of the best I have ever had, just a little undercooked when I ordered a medium well...but VERY tasty!",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "Gave this place a shot because my friends are always raving about it. The hostess was friendly. We sat at the only two open seats at the bar. No greeting or anything so we left after about 8 minutes of awkward waiting. To their defense it was extremely busy. Maybe I'll give it another try when it's not so slammed..",

Not too expensive either - 9 dollar glass of wine is cheaper than I paid anywhere on the strip!

Better than reading a copy of Us Weekly!",

        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "I don't want to give it any stars, it's a trick! the lobster isn't lobster it's mushy and gross.  It wasn't worth the price at all.  I really wish I hadn't insisted on coming here and paying more for less. The crab legs were the only thing I had that was good but you can't really mess that up. Next time I'm in town I'll pass on the buffet scene.",
        "Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty. I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty.

They do offer other selections other than sushi.",

I ordered the lasagna and its consistently lukewarm to cold. The chicken parm is the same way. The only consistently good thing on the menu seems to be the orzo pasta salad, which is cold to begin with.",
        "I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.",
        "The remodel is on point. Favorite hotel by far. Loved the staff and that free cookie was the bees knees. I can't wait to stay again.",
        "We come here often! The food is excellent and fresh. We have great service and enjoy the ambiance. They have delicious salsa and you can ask for one a bit hotter and wow it's great! They also have great lemonade!!\\n\\nDuring the week they have very reasonable lunch specials!",
        "I haven't had a lot of good experience with the buffets in Vegas, and this one was no different.  The crowd was huge of course, but we got through pretty quick.  But for the price ($37 or something like that) the food just wasn't very good.  Lots of it was lukewarm and not very appealing looking.  I guess I need to try one of the more traditional steak and lobster, old-school, casino restaurants for a good buffet in Vegas.",
        "For a seafood buffet I was not impressed. Crab legs were good. Lobster tails were small and chewy. Prime rib was good. Oysters were small. Desert selection was small but pleasing. Overall, ok buffet but I don't think I would return.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "Not so much for me . Last years participants was not impressive. I would rather spend more money and go to one of the bigger events like devoured , feast on the streets , or taste of biltmore. My friends that go like it because its family friendly so i can see that point of view , it is family friendly and a nice way to kick off the summer.",
        "this place is nestled inside the miles shop of Planet Hollywood. a cute indoor / outdoor restaurant. i've never been to Paris but i would imagine it to be quite similar. it's romantic backdrop, floral decor, cute waiters, and dimmed light gets you in the mood to order some wine/champagne/cocktails even before looking at the menu. We ordered crab cakes, whole lobster linguine, soup, oysters, chicken. \\ni enjoyed the food!",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "Went because of their $50 gift coupon.  The two for $99 filet and lobster tail special with sides and dessert was perfect.  Not Caesar salad fans but this one was tasty and the fresh bread was a nice start.  Fresh margaritas were made just right.  Leftover dessert came home with us.\\nWill definitely return for their attention to detail.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "Dinner here with family members. Large, varied menu. Heather was our server. She was pleasant and efficient. I had the ribs and salad  bar. Salad bar had a good selection of veggies and dressings. Ribs were OK but not stellar. Mashed potatoes were real and gravy was tasty.. I want to try the chicken fried chicken sometime. My sister had the blt and it was loaded with bacon.",
        "I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum.",
        "I came here with a group for drinks before a group dinner...didn't like that you couldn't seat yourself at the bar without the hostess helping you.  We tried some drinks and french fries...all were good, albeit overpriced, but nothing to rush back for!",
        "The Good\\nLots of local food\\nDelicious pre-made food options\\nPretty decent bakery\\n\\nThe Bad\\nNot a lot of options for staples\\nA little hard to navigate\\n\\nThe Ugly\\nPrice are sometimes just too high for my taste",
        "That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)",
        "I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait.",
        "The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.",
        "Lobster was too salty & my steak was over cooked, mentioned it to the waiter who offered to send it back but also told me it was cooked to the right temp but last I knew medium rare isn't fully cooked around the edges with a small rare center not all the way through.....",
        "Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.",
        "Get an espresso drink, the brewed coffee (caf\\u00e9 filtre) is mediocre and a little stale tasting.",
        "Definition of a roach motel with cockroaches working behind the front desk. I say its a waste of money remodeling \\\"the quad\\\" \\\"the linq\\\", \\\"imperial palace\\\", whatever Ceasers is calling it now-a-days. I say save the money and level it. This place is disgusting and stinks! Worse than the worst motel 6 on the planet! Employees are such jerks too.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Enjoyed the Tortellini and the service was excellent. Bypass the wanna be places like the Tilted Kilt in this area and go to a real place for food.",
        "It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it.",
        "Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4.",
        "I love Outback, the steaks are great and a lot less pricey then the hotel steakhouses.  The wait staff, hostesses and management are awesome.",
        "Waited 15 minutes at hostess stand to be seated, no one showed. Sat ourselves at the bar amongst other guests, where a manager was stocking beer. No greeting from manager even. Wait another 10 minutes to see other guests looking around for service as well, but no showing of a bartender, server or even the previously seen manager. Sad showing from such high expectations.",
        "Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. \\nWe sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. \\nThere are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great.",
        "We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \\\"shrunken\\\" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!",
        "After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.",
        "It's a bit on the cheesy side and could use some major remodeling but my 2 year old enjoyed it enough.",
        "This place has good pizza and wings, but the wait staff can't handle a good sized crowd. Waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up, waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing. You might get prompt service from the token greaser if you're a cute girl, otherwise steer clear unless it's dead. Sad, I had such high hopes for this place. More wait staff, signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe?",
        "Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!",
        "Service was terrible.  It started when I asked for a different table and the hostess said no. That should have been my clue.  The food was tasteless.  I have ordered the shrimp portofino several times previous.  I always thought it was good.  But tonight it was awful. I'll never come here again.",
        "Went for dinner last night, they have closed.  Don't know if it's just a remodel or whether they are out of here...",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "I had tried this place before for lunch and thought it was just OK.  I've since tried the brunch and, let me tell you, that's where it's at!  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  We sometimes plan our whole trip around making it to that weekend brunch.  It's outstanding!  Our favorites are the Steak & Eggs, Chilaquiles, and Coconut and French Toast.  Skip the shrimp BLT--pretty strange.",
        "I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years. I find the steaks are always good, but the seafood is really hit or miss. Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked. It was like complete rubber. It was barely edible. I should have known better to order it there, but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot. Very disappointing.",
        "I cannot really explain how slow the service is. We were seated and waited about 10 mins till we went to the bar to get service. We then waited another 30 or so for food. Our drinks were never refilled. The whole time  we watched about 5 hostesses sit around and and do nothing. Not worth $13 for a burgers.",
        "My boyfriend and I dined in and thoroughly enjoyed it. Food was good and our hostess/waitress was great!!! Good food, great service, great price.",
        "Went here early ***Sunday** the food was great/Drinks! The hostess and servers where perfect young and energetic . Sat at the large patio great weather!",
        "our favorites are the miso soup, mermaid and baked lobster roll! I take my kids here often, we love it!  The atmosphere is nice, the kids enjoy sitting and watching them make the rolls.  The lunch specials are very affordable the customer service is great.  very clean too!",
        "Just got my brows and lip done and all I have to say is wow!! Totally professional environment and so modern inside. I have really weird shaped eyebrows that pose a challenge for many estheticians but they were shaped perfectly here. My esthetician (forgot her name I'm sorry) even showed me how to correctly fill them in afterward. Reasonably priced for such a great job!",
        "Stoles it! I got the coconut shrimp which was amazing. The shrimp is huge! And I had the lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich which was awesome. However, the fries that went with it were average.",
        "Had better service at motel 6. Advised front desk of drunk patrons kicking my tires while awaiting valet with my toddler.  Front said \\\"I'm sorry to hear\\\", then walked away. Dirty towels and bed linen did me in... going back Motel 6 on next visit.",
        "The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back.",
        "Nice atmosphere. the breakfast is good. The staff seems friendly enough.  The macaroons are disappointing.although tasty, they are a little soggier than I would prefer. The Union at Biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 2-3 times the variety.",
        "My business partner and I met there for an impromptu lunch and discover a hidden gem.  We took the server's recommendations  for the roasted corn pizza with bacon, then the burger with arugula, tomato, caramelized onion and provolone. ( many other toppings available), and the roasted duck club sandwich. All we amazing, fresh and cooked perfectly.  Just found a new favorite!",
        "While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!",
        "This place is terrible. The waiters are on their cell phones most of the time. Management allows other patrons to scream, yell and cuss at the television as well as other patrons, all while banging on tables and the bar.",
        "This is pretty average. A couple of friends and I stopped by right around closing time, and the nice hostess was really nice about taking us in, which we appreciated. Other than that nice gesture, all I can say is that their food was average and merits a 3 star review. From what I can see their service was comparable. Pretty good portions for the price paid!",
        "So I walked this bridge many times on my way back and fourth from the Pirates game. The Bridge is closed during Pirate games, but has a safe walking area even when cars are allowed on.  The bridge has beautiful views and on one end a guy selling $1 waters and Pirate Swag.",
        "Yeah, Alexander is right...they do leave you alone. That's the good part. The bad part comes when you actually want some advice. For the most part they are clueless. What really gets me is how hard they push the extended warranties. I know that it's a big revenue stream for them but it really boarders on criminal how they take advantage of people. Oh well, buyer beware I suppose :-)",
        "the ambiance/circuses are ok....but the food is actually fast food hiding in fancy clothing...expensive but mehhh. the popovers are no way near as good as those at BLT /camelback Inn.  The place is ok but kind of caters to the Arcadia types and takes advantage of them. Expense does not match the value.",
        "My mother and I came here for Christmas Eve and we were SO PLEASED with the ensemble-style waitstaff. I had the surf and turf and she had the dual lobster tails. Perfectly prepared seafood, very light and buttery--but filling! Amazing ambiance, great food presentation. We came for the view, fell in love with the food. Had no room for dessert! We thought the photographer was a little aggressive, but she took some great photos.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended"

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew.",
        "A bit much for adults, but great for the young ones.  Lots of animated animals and large fish tanks.  Food is amusement park fare to match the ambiance.  A bit pricey if you don't appreciate the showmanship of the place.  Fine for families but not for a date in my view.  Service was very slow.",
        "Love these places. I was at one before in Dallas years ago so it had been a while but it was as good as I remembered. Very good drinks, super salad bar but don't fill up on it too much! All the meats they bring were all very good. So were the fried plantains. Incredible service. Always there when you need them. Not there when you don't. Pricey but worth it for a special night out.",
        "The pizza is good, but the pasta is outstanding. Nice quaint family outing place, or a great place to take a date for a private dinner. They, also, offer some good salads.",
        "If you order online and it's wednesday or later in the week DO NOT  use 2d day UPS you will not get your part unless you're  very close by. I'm in Texas and ordered on wednesday thinking I could get my parts by saturday latest.....nope 5 days later they arrive(what the Hell is 2 day air?) needless to say no more business from me. Yes I wrote them and they didn't have the courtesy to reply either.",
        "Wow first time in a while and this place is a mess kinda disgusting...kid was too busy counting the tips\\n\\nPreviously there used to be a girl who I would always see working here that kept the spot super clean...all I can say is if I were the health department they wouldn't get an A grade today",
        "Ordered chicken fingers and fries on special for $5.95. The chicken fingers were the kind of chicken you find in a $1 McDonald's chicken sandwich. The fries were completely tasteless. No salt. For the price, Jack in the Box or Farm Basket is much much better. Will not eat here again.",
        "My ice chest was stolen from my room which had a coffee commuter cup, three cans of soda, milk, and spoon.  The Front Desk Staff was no help. \\\"Frank\\\" The weekend Manager in Charge  and The Security Officer were the only ones that were helpful.  There has been no follow up from the Motel 6 Staff at 195 East Tropicana Avenue, Las Vegas. I was staying there from September 08, 2011 Through September 10, 2011.",
        "By far, the friendliest Chipotle I've been to. Awesome staff, above and beyond service. Thank you guys for being so awesome here!",
        "Solid chicken pad Thai and a good bang for your buck for the amount you get. Sweet lunch special for like 7 bucks I think. This is my go-to for quick Thai that is always solid.",
        "This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.",
        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "The food was pretty descent for the most part. My biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok.",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving. You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America. Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout.",
        "I joined the club and wanted to enroll with a personal trainer. The manager Neemo was so uncommunicative.    When we did speak he acted like I was bothering him and very condescending.   Christine was no help either. \\nFinally I connected with Corey and Lindsay and I am now a happy customer.  Thanks Corey and Lindsay.   Daisy.",
        "I tried this place after receiving a coupon in the Norterra flyer. I wasn't disappointed. This place has really good pizza and salads! Service was very speedy and their food was excellent. We ended up splitting a salad and a pizza and still had food to take home! Sauce also servers wine and beer which really compliments the food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food.",
        "I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was \\\"MOLE\\\" oh my!  I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized...",
        "I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use.",
        "We had a great experience! Such down to earth people who care about good food and service. I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak with a cup of creamy asparagus soup! Thank you Kristen for the great service!!!",
        "Super speedy online ordering and they come to your house so quick! Can't beat that. Hey it's Chinese food, not rocket science. It gets the job done for those awesome cravings. I am not a frequent diner at Chinese food restaurants, but all I know is that this tastes great and is delivered fast for my lazy days. Can't beat that.",
        "Still same real good food but take out only.  Upper St Clair Township does not allow eat in due to lack of parking, I was told.\\n\\nWe ordered a fresh Walnut and gorgonzola salad and sausage calzone, booth were real good.  Love the sausage!",
        "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger.\\nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips.\\nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.\\n\\nThis was worth trying once.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment.",
        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "The food here was pretty good. But the service was very slow. And we had a cranky kid with us which you would think would speed them up a little bit. But that didn't help. They don't have high chairs or boasters so I would say this place is NOT kid friendly. If you want to try it leave the little ones at home for this one.",
        "Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.",
        "Dr. Noggle is the best!! She's the only one I allow to touch my back. Great customer service and very personalized. I would recommend this going here to anyone!!",
        "I had the lunch special Mini-Pizza while traveling through Tempe.  It was too salty.  Not pleasant.  The ambiance was very noisy.  The service was slow.  I would not go back.",
        "Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.",
        "This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays.",
        "Freddy is fantastic!  I needed a valve replaced in my toilet so it would flush and called Freddy who arrived within an hour on a Sunday and charged me less than half of what other plumbers were quoting me for a Sunday repair.  He's very honest and reliable...THANK YOU so much for your help today!",
        "Ehhhhhhh.\\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",
        "Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds.",
        "Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip.",
        "Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \\\"three amigos\\\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!",
        "I've been to the Tussaud's in London, in Hollywood, and love the one in Vegas, although they have many of the same figures in all three (that's the economy of scale you get having multiple locations, I guess).  Fun to take pics of you and the celebrities and get right up and see them up close and personal.",
        "Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.",
        "Excellent service; GREAT food. \\nThe staff is really nice and accommodating. We eat at Bunky's frequently and I just hosted a baby shower there.  They did a great job of accommodating my budget and making my friend feel very special.  I highly recommend them for catering as well.",
        "There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher.  There is no customer service.  In fact, most employees are down right rude.  They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food - whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them.  Avoid if at all possible.",
        "Moira  updated their menu and took off those frozen potstickers that I mentioned in my earlier review.  Service was terrific and their new offerings were delicious.  They have a roll topped with a coconut shrimp that is very tasty.  Also enjoyed the $5 bombers that were on special for Halloween.",
        "Everything we've tried has been amazing, including the Blind Special. Friendly staff; great decor; one of our favorite places to brunch.",
        "Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "Now it is my turn to write a review! I had my appointment with Paul! He did the most amazing tattoo in memory of my brother, Darryl. I had to incorporate my favorite thing as well Hello Kitty. His imagination & expertise to it to another realm & exceeded beyond my wildest imagination. Well worth a months rent, lol. Thank you to every one there for being so incredible & wonderful! I LOVE this place!",
        "Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.",
        "A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. \\n\\nThere are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.",
        "I was greeted right away by a very friendly staff.  Even those I was late I got started right away. I appreciated the little extra time Tina and Hyeu took to make sure my nails were meticulous! They run a clean shop and do an excellent job! Thank you Kathy for the humorous chit chat on the side.  I am coming back for certain",
        "Came here to check out the BBQ. It was just okay. Service was good. But just not special enough to come back to. I think this place is more for their drinks.",
        "Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!",
        "Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.",
        "Quick and tasty Chicken Sandwches. Nothing special",
        "This place is overrated.  It was fine but not at all special, not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good.  Sorry.\\n\\nConsidering how many great restaurants there are in Vegas, there is no reason to come here.",
        "At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food.",
        "It's a great place to go on the weekend. My favorite part is the diner the food is great, prices are perfect,  and service is amazing.  My favorite server is Kristy.",
        "The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.",
        "poor in room Quality, but Close in Atmosphere.  The Hotel seemed more personal, not too extreme.  staff is friendly.  The gift Shop sales Liquor and I won $500 one night and $1600 the next on the same machine.",
        "Amazing one of a kind furniture!  I have purchased several items for my new home and love everything I chose.  Everything is hand painted and has a special touch.  Owners are very nice and have a delivery service available to assist you if you don't own a truck.  Check it out!!",

        "Great little bar to grab a bite before getting your drink on at the Gin Mill.  I love the quaint atmosphere and seriously good bar bites. We had less than stellar service on our last visit, but you know, that's not what brings me into a place like this in the first place.",
        "Good Mexican food, but it's expensive (at least I thought so). I went there for lunch and had the lunch special ($10) and a coconut margarita ($10) which equaled $22 for lunch! The drinks were also slow to come out. So if you're a tourist, I think it's okay. But for a local, it's pricey.",
        "Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back",
        "Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...\\n\\nPassed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus",
        "My expectations are usually fairly low when eating in a mall food court. Decided to give this place a chance and wasn't disappointed. \\n\\nI ordered a mini bento box which was actually plenty of food. I was surprised to find the amount of flavor in the dish. You could tell that it was prepared with care and had a wonderful presentation.\\n\\nReasonably priced- overall enjoyable. Nothing special though.",
        "Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!",
        "Wanna get drunk as a skunk under 5 bucks?? Just sit at a machine over here and play pennies while cocktail waitresses bring you drinks incessantly. The moment you walk in they take your order. I suggest the \\\"Adios Motherf*ucker\\\". You'll thank me later.",
        "If you want a great, gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road. They are cheaper and she's an accomplished pastry chef. The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all.",
        "This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.",
        "Solid Mexican in a seedy part of town.  It's a shame that Carolina's is so close otherwise I might drop by here more often.",
        "Catfish taco lunch special every Friday.  Great lunch for $5!\\n\\nThat said, the best time of day to visit the Kitchen is happy hour - bargains on very high quality offerings.",
        "I truly love golds. Clean facility , friendly staff, and my favorite part : the cardio cinema ! Not to mention the wonderful personal trainers, namely Jamie. She is always friendly and motivating. I've learned so many great work outs that I can easily replicate at home. The prices are reasonable as well.",
        "Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.\\n\\nThe drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny.",
        "This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.",
        "If you're a barbecue fan, this is the place for you.  Get the little pig if you're a beginner, its a good intro to BBQ.  The atmosphere is great, and on a sunny day there is no better place to grab a beer (specially on work lunch break - wink wink).  Parking can be a challenge at time but nothing too concerining.",
        "Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.",
        "Got home after picking up my order and realized they forgot my breadsticks. I even ordered extra. I called to get a refund on the extra ones and was told I would need to speak to a manager, 10 minutes holding and no one. I hung up. Poor customer service. Food was good though.",
        "The service is the BEST in town!  Did you know that this engine runs on veggie oil?  Good for your tummy and good for the environment.  An all around PERFECT experience.  Thank you Cpt. Bill",
        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "Great performances and acts! The main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate. I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "Half of my kalbi was cold and the solution to the problem was to order more and get I would get a little extra? No thank you. Portions are even smaller when ordered to go as well. What happened to this place?",
        "TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix.",
        "Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \\nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \\nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc.",
        "The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !",
        "I like to stop in here now and again since its so close to home. Good service and a really fun selection of gelato. Shares the building with coffee shop Hava Java next door. Nice private outdoor, shaded, seating as well. Good overall, but three stars for an previous issue with some spoiled gelato.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "What an amazing facility. If you are ever in Pittsburgh the Cathedral of Learning is a must see. Walk in awe as you travel the different floors via the elevators. The views from some of the floors are unparalleled. The history and beauty of this treasure will definitely make your trip to the Pitt campus a special one. Be sure to also check out the Hines Chapel right next door.",
        "Good sushi!! The place is located on a very quiet, kindda ghetto part of Fremont but the sushi is excellent.",
        "I thank God i got the tickets for free. Otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in Vegas. The women were hott, but the overall performance was really bad. They tried to mix in comedy and singing as well. Just horrible show. I did see only three couples walk out.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "Extremely poor customer service - the owner lied to me when I came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready. That was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready. There's nothing special about this place.",
        "Waited almost 2 hours for food. One server for about 11 tables. Poor thing was running like crazy. First batch of chips we got were cooked in so much leftover oil they tasted like old oil. Second round was better. By the time we got our food we just had a packed up so we could leave. No drink refills. However very nice folks. I may give it one more chance just because of how nice the owners were.",
        "This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled"

        "Had fried tofu, fried pork, peanut butter dumplings and eggplant. The fried foods were dry and tough. Pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in Montreal. Only try this if you're desperate for Chinese. (The pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood.)",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",
        "Dude, this place ain't half bad and I didn't even have the munchies!  You don't have to be stoned here to enjoy the food.\\n\\nA variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something.  Doritos anyone?",
        "Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!",
        "HANDS DOWN most authentic Asian cuisine my hubby Andi have found in Madison!  Congee love! The chicken was moist and tasty, so good!",
        "The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.",
        "Not a place you can judge by its location or ambience - you just have to eat the food! Delicious and unique - not getting these dishes anywhere else in Madison. When we moved on to dessert, the chef brought us out 2 piping hot leaves filled with sticky, sweet rice (wish I knew the names of these dishes...) The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!",
        "This place is a Madison game day staple. The only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people (and that may be modest). If you are into ass to elbow people, but an incredibly good time, this is the spot for you!",
        "Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere.",
        "Nice bartender. Calamari was awful. All you taste is the frying batter. Sushi rolls were fine. Beer was cold! Happy Hour is better spent elsewhere.",
        "The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house.",
        "This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.",
        "Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "Worst service of my life. Slow service. Wasn't busy at all. Got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out. Save your money and go elsewhere.",
        "The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere.",

        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "This place gets only 1star as well because of the waitress was nice. One of the hostess as we walked in was rude and did not even smile. I commented for her to smile, the more she gave me this dagger look. We were excited about this new place but with what happened, it will be a while for the next visit.",
        "I hate to leave a negative review because I love getting hair here but I realized today they're ripping people off. I bought hair and it was $99 on the price sticker. When I got home I noticed the sticker had been placed over another. I peeled back the sticker and the other price was $45 and they tried to sharpie through it. Over a 50% markup?!?! I believe I'll start shopping elsewhere!",
        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible.  \\n\\nThe girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",
        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost. Long lines are not worth the wait. Look elsewhere",
        "It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere.",
        "This is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station.  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",

        "Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!",
        "Absolutely horrible.  Did take out chopped salad was not worth $11.00.  Small portion and the pizza was ice cold and was like as thin as a piece of paper maybe 3 pieces of the schrieners chicken sausage on it.  Pathetic.  $30 for that meal Are you kidding me. My girlfriend and I arent even full.  We had to go get more food.  Never ever go back.  Get your shit together!!",
        "Nope-not authentic, pre-prepared, the chips are way too greasy and flavorless, and every entree tastes the same as every other entree. I went there with a party of five.l tasted everyone's entree. Tasted like we were all eating the same thing.\\nI have not had authentic Mexican anywhere in Madison. I'm told by my friend from Mexico, that yellow cheese is not used in Mexican food, nor are black olives.",
        "Visited EQ3 for some decor ideas. It was OK, very contemporary (which doesn't happen to be my style), but overall nothing spectacular about this place. They had some items priced reasonably, but lots that I felt were overpriced for what they were. I would keep this place in mind, but look elsewhere first.",
        "They wanted 30 dollars to hem a apron..when I told them that's too expensive they told me I can go somewhere else and gave me my apron. Don't like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.",
        "I Love Akahana! I think most people don't realize it exists because it is located in a small shopping center beside a little bookstore in Plaza Midwood, but if you've never been and love shush, this is the place to be. They always have buy one get one free specials, tasty drinks and tons of fun rolls to choose from.",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",
        "Yummy, quick lunch! This is our go-to local Chinese restaurant. It has been consistently good over the past 4-5 years we have been living here. We especially like their luncheon specials and to go dinners. We love their mu shu chicken/pork and their wonton soup.",
        "Sulky customer service every time I've been here. They also skimp on the portions compared to other Milio's locations in Madison.",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.",

        "Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs.",
        "We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.",
        "This is my morning place. A quick drive from my house and conveniently located on Tatum. The lines here move quickly, coffee is great, staff are friendly. What's not to love? It's what you'd expect from a Starbucks, but what few actually deliver.",
        "Overpriced and nothing special. Tried it twice in a year. Money better spent elsewhere.",
        "I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.",
        "Great for walking around in, The Prices are expensive for everything from Alcohol to Gelato to Watches and Various items. But it is the Forum shops and makes for a great time none the less to get out of the Hot Vegas Sun and look at things you may never afford or would want if you could afford it. Lots of good restaurants inside as well. Which range from reasonable to Take out a Second Mortgage on the house.",
        "I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price.",
        "I didn't like the BBQ sauce on the ribs here.  While my ribs were passable, they certainly weren't excellent.  I'm not a fan of baked beans at all, so I skipped that.  I think they were barbequed which seems unappealing.  The cole slaw wasn't my favorite either, it was kind of blah.  All in all, I'd say go elsewhere if you are looking for delicious barbeque.",
        "Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. \\nBreakfast is ok, but not more. \\nService is friendly. \\nNo twin rooms available..",
        "Very nice brew pub to compliment the Madison beer scene. All the tastings in the beer flight were good. The food menu is also quite good. Worth a return visit.",
        "Despite the 2.5 rating on yelp, the food can be compared to a average home town buffet without the selection. Overall the food was okay and your better off going to the In-n-out down the street for a bomb ass juicy burger. In addition, there is the smoke from the nearby casino that permeates the buffet, so if your into that then this place is definitely your bet. Otherwise, I'll dine elsewhere.",
        "Fair prices [including kids size] and great specialty flavors! Saw them @ First Friday and it was definitely a great stop on a hot June day. Quick and friendly service with a smile! They drive their truck to many locations so call and see where they are located and go get one of their shaved ice treats!",
        "Great service! No wait, actually owned by Pamela's! The food was great-- maybe even better than next door! All sorts of Yiddish references and fun Jewish foods that are hard to find elsewhere. Love the challah French toast. Highly recommended!!",
        "I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere",
        "The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star.",
        "Don't go here to gamble! The food is good, but the bartenders are awful. They spent the whole night gossiping in the corner and talking on the phone. I'd rather take my money elsewhere.",
        "Stopped by last evening and sat at the bar for nearly 15 minutes being ignored by the two bartenders.  The guy next to me was served and then the bartender went out to smoke.  He watched me as i walked the length of the bar to leave.  Called them today thinking they might like some feedback, but never heard from them.  Was I too old?  Wrong shirt?  Many other bars in town seem happy to take my money.  I suggest you take your business elsewhere.",
        "I have made it a habit of stopping here for boba milk tea on my way home from a delicious meal at hot and juicy crawfish.\\n\\nThis place can get pretty crowded, but the to-go line is reasonably quick. I've never eaten in, so I can only comment on the boba. I am never disappointed with the texture or the taste of the boba. The consistency and yummy taste keep me coming back for more.",
        "After trying a few Chinese places around Campustown, I decided that I liked this place over the others. I really enjoy their orange chicken, the mongolian beef, and the beef with broccoli. Their sichuan food is also worth trying. The atmosphere is okay and the service is acceptable. My complaint is that the price is a little more than others but my favorite dishes taste better here than elsewhere so I am fine with that.",
        "Swanky place, good atmosphere & food, right in the heart of Madison's cultural center. A great place to meet friends for food & drinks, even catch the game @ the bar.",
        "Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \\n\\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere.",
        "The food here is awful. Go elsewhere.",
        "Always good food and wine here. Tonight we each had the green salad with beets. My wife added grilled NC shrimp (an $8 add on). Nicely prepared and flavored. I had the salad without any add ons, but I once again succumbed to the sliders; done perfectly.  We left with a smile on on faces.",
        "Food is good. The burger is great. The service a bit slow and dreamy. They think they are Bohemians and they aren't. Finally avoid the owner she is a complete ditz and space case...just smile and avoid this cat lady.  Cheers.",
        "What can I say...always fabulous, every time we get off the plane, whether I'm with my Mom, my boyfriend, my friends, doesn't matter...this is where we come first! The hash is AMAZING, the service is always with a smile and efficient. The venue itself is fantastic and just all around one of my favorite Vegas restaurants.",
        "So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \\n\\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!",
        "Everyone was very helpful and friendly here. Food was good as well. Had the dungeness crab w/ 2 sides for $22. Can't wait to come back and try the maryland blue crab!!\\n\\n**Update\\nBlue crabs were great, very sweet... But worth it if you don't mind getting your hands dirty!\\n\\nMy favorite. Their snow crab, easy to get to and delicious!!",
        "Francesca has an amazing vision for all things skin. Pricing is competitive and she has great monthly specials as well.On top she's a total sweetheart!! I couldn't imagine going elsewhere.When i find something that works I stick with it. Love her!!!",
        "Amazing, unique, and fresh wings.  If atmosphere is important to you, then go elsewhere.  But if you are all about the food, then this is the place for you.  I dragged my lady (who loves wings) to this dive bar in the middle of nowhere.  She was very skeptical until she had a wing.  Apparently now we have to go there every Sunday for football.  Great great wings.",
        "This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \\nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "Wonderful little cheese shop with a variety of cheeses you've never heard of or heard of but never tasted. You can buy small pieces - orphans, they call them - so that you can taste without spending a bundle. There are gifts for foodies, too: jams, confits, crackers, etc. Really friendly staff and great sandwiches. Wish this had been around during my days at UW-Madison.",
        "They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.",
        "PROS:\\nIf you have been boycotting Starbucks for a long time, this is the place to escape to. \\n\\nThey have a coffee drink called 911. \\n\\nStaff is really cool and one informed me that they give proceeds to MDA. \\n\\nCONS: \\nA small menu of coffee to choose from. \\n\\nNo shady area to sit. You have to drive thru and go find that shade elsewhere.",
        "A GREAT value for your money IF you get the rennovated rooms in tower 2.\\nHowever, the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing. My advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere.",
        "My favorite Indian restaurant in Madison! Delicious!",
        "Great music, but bartenders seems to be bothered or you feel unwelcome, no smile :( just drink!",
        "Im not from this area so when I come around Phoenix I always have to stop at a Jersey Mikes since there are very few in So Cal.  I can't wait till they open more where I live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to Subway and Quiznos.",
        "i spent the better part of a slightly drizzly afternoon here last week.  so so pretty.  even with the cold and the rain. seeing lovely things like jewels and crowns and all the various nooks and crannies to be found was quite lovely.  the admission's a bit steep, but it's really a must-do in edinburgh. the views of the city are to die for and the history is fascinating.",
        "Grade: C-\\n\\nThe most over-rated restaurant in Madison. Decent food. Outrageous prices. Good service. How this place is still in business amazes me.",
        "It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.",
        "It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.",
        "A traditional (dark wood and real ale) Edinburgh pub which offer a lot more than its dark interior suggests, for starters they serves up some surprisingly tasty food until midnight. Offerings include a selection of Buffalo burger, a hot pot special and normally a tasty homemade soup and while not the cheapest the food is well prepared and filling thus well worth the money.\\n\\nMy advice - check out the green mantle, have a few jars and something to eat, relax and enjoy.",
        "This year all the markets were labeled \\\"Edinburgh's Christmas\\\" but some of the old faves were still at the old school end. Not as many pretty handcrafted things, but lots of options for nibbles and plenty of entertainment.",
        "I got pushed here from the flamingo for a night. Even though it's free don't do it. Pay to go elsewhere.  Service was terrible. Check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers.",
        "The fish on the sushi gave my friend food poisoning. Worse part is the manager is literally watching you from the Cameras in the back. \\n\\nThe worst part is that if you order more of the same sushi they reduce the fish portion and increase the rice amount. I ONLY TASTED STICKY RISE!!!",
        "Great selection of Triple 7 house brewed beers and pretty good food, but a little bland. Great atmosphere with plenty of bar seats and tables. Will come back for sure for the beer. Will eat lunch or dinner elsewhere. This is in a not so desirable part of town, wouldn't venture here at night.  Go during the day,enjoy some really good beers and get back to the good restaurants on the strip.",
        "The rooms are so gross and dirty.  I got a skin infection from it.  Really needs updating a  good cleaning.  Very outdated.  Difficult to find anything in the hotel (mainly the gym).  Stay elsewhere.",
        "This is probably the only sushi spot in the airport and there is not a ton of variety, but gets the job done if you are in the mood for sushi. I didn't think the fish tasted very fresh (some weird chewy textures going on) and the edamame tasted microwaved.  I know airport food isn't great in general, but I'll pass on the sushi next time and go for a salad elsewhere if I need a healthy fixing.",
        "We were going to do a Cirque show but couldn't fit it in. Went to the Jersey Boys instead. WOW,  That was awesome.  Great story.  Great music.  I am so glad we ended up at this site instead.",
        "This is probably the worst breakfast place in the whole Madison area.\\nEven McDonald's pancakes taste better, and at a third of the price!\\nbottom line, one star food at two dollar signs price.\\nIf you are looking for a better place at a reasonable price in Verona, go to the HyVee restaurant (just next to the HyVee grocery store).",
        "Took my buddy here the other day to nurse a hangover. Great food. Reasonably priced. Definitely did the job for us. They are open til 2pm serving breakfast. Friendly staff. They brought us pitchers of our drinks so we didn't have to chase a waitress down everytime we wanted a refill. I like that.",
        "After a day traveling around Edinburgh, Wings was the perfect snack to fill my American wing-loving desires. Good atmosphere. They had a movie marathon going on downstairs. Service was pretty good too. I had a magner's and dancing in the bleu flame (hot bleu cheese)! I'll be coming back sooner rather than later! :)",
        "Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere",
        "This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. \\n\\nYou have to see this if you are in Vegas!"

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",

        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.",
        "We came to Vegas on a very small budget. We got the buffet of buffets deal and ate at le village, it was lovely. The decor was beautiful and the food was outstanding. We even decided to return for dinner. Very pleased with the entire experience.",

Went to get business cards for my new small business..talked to Travis the graphic designer about what I wanted and he seemed like he was happy to help but now a month later and after multiple calls I have heard no response..should change their name from Never Late to Never Received",

Came with fries and a drink. \\nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \\nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \\nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome.",

        "Extremely unprofessional. In the waiting room I heard the secretary have to reschedule several appointments because \\\"the system doesn't update properly and they're looking into it.\\\" They can't copy Xrays so the entire reason we went there is useless. Had to get another xray at the oral surgeon, and they still billed us for the Xray that we couldn't use.",

Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous.",
        "Food is always great but the service was horrible.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. There was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored. Next time I want Chompie's I will be going to location in Tempe!",
        "I give one star, not because the food was bad. In fact we didn't get a chance to try the food. Walked in and they said, \\\"no more orders.\\\"  That's bad when you're open for 20 more minutes. \\nIts hard to earn new customers and we probably won't go out of our way to come back",
        "Went there with a party of 9 and they refused to seat us together. Service was awefull and food took over an hour. They were not busy.   Some people liked the food, some didn't.

        "Not a place you can judge by its location or ambience - you just have to eat the food! Delicious and unique - not getting these dishes anywhere else in Madison. When we moved on to dessert, the chef brought us out 2 piping hot leaves filled with sticky, sweet rice (wish I knew the names of these dishes...) The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",

It's not brain surgery people!!!!",
        "On vacation and this place was across the street. The guy who helped me was very nice. He carried on conversation and reccommeded places I should try in the area while visiting. I wish I knew his name to put on here. He spoke english and lived in North Carolina at one time. Anway, prices were good and service",
        "Decent food. The pizza is really cheap and when I got it I realized why it was so cheap not that great. The reason I gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie. Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley.",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",

Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",
        "Really wanted to like this place :( 3 stars just for the fried yuca. The meat in my arepa tasted like steamed dog food, had a really gamey flavor. We literally took the rest of our arepas home and gave it to our dog",
        "Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \\\"all-you-can eat\\\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",

Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",

Christine was no help either. \\nFinally I connected with Corey and Lindsay and I am now a happy customer.  Thanks Corey and Lindsay.   Daisy.",
        "Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila... The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back.",
        "boo. hiss. \\n\\nfor some reason i'm just not a fan. the service was simply horrible, and quite unacceptable for such a baller hotel. \\n\\ni asked for the front desk to complete a small task such as deliver envelopes to other hotel guests. i was less than impressed when they lost the envelopes 4 separate times! also, they charge $2.50 to deliver an envelope. lame. \\n\\nnot. rad.",
        "Went for dessert & drinks.  Bar service was a slow & desserts were meh.  Did like the location & that the front walls opened to the street, but that isn't enough to get me to go back. Too many other great options around the area to settle for meh.",
        "The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house.",
        "of course since i stayed at the Bellagio, i went here to check it out. i knew since i stayed at the Bellagio, that this place would be a tad expensive, which it was. when I was there, the place was packed! my friends and i had bottle service so we did not worry about ordering drinks at the bar. The music was good. I'd go back here if I'm ever in vegas.",
        "Went to an afternoon show with my Dad (he's 76, I'm 52), and we both loved it. Only issue is that there are no servers, just a self-serve bar. Kid-friendly, too.",

I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized...",
        "Loved this place!! I went two nights in a row after the club. Pizza is great but the only drag was the wait. And it's on the 3rd floor on the opposite site of the pool tables btw ;)",
        "I came in to get a pedicure with,my friend and we had a lively time. Great atmosphere with legit technicians.",
        "i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast.",
        "Did not like this place at all. It was small and very empty. Now this could be that it was a tad early in the evening, but we left and went right to the mirage's other club, and it had a lot of people and was a lot more fun (5 minutes after this place).  So, not sure what the story was on that.",
        "okay, i want to start by saying that i was dressed like a champ and had no money. my two friends however, had a couple dozen K  on them and were dressed \\\"okay\\\". we were treated like shit almost everywhere we went in this casino because of that. Michael Mina was an outstanding place though. if you're hungry and love wine, go there!",
        "I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!",
        "I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.",
        "Went here today and this place was great. All my coworkers gave about there gluten-free and vegan donuts but I went with their snickerdoodle. Moist, chewy. Just the right amount of sweet. And you don't feel quite as bad about eating it because they use the highest quality ingredients. I recommend it and I will def be going back real soon.",
        "When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \\\"certified technicians\\\" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else.",
        "Went again, this time for dinner.  I still say it's not worth it for the price, even more so now after I've been to the Studio B buffet. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-b-buffet-henderson)\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving it another star is because that creme brulee is out of this world. And maybe I didn't hate their meat as much this time.",
        "The sales approach at this place is nothing short of a Used Car lot.  Three gentlemen fought over shaking my hand as I walked through the door and everything went downhill from there.",
        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "I had a so-so experience at AZ on the Rocks my first visit but due to the absolutely wonderful follow up and customer service I have received since then I am definitely amending my original review. The owner really went out of his way to make sure that my next visit is much better. As soon as my schedule allows I will be heading back to check it out for the second time.",
        "It's packed like PURE is and you're really just constantly moving around. Pretty hard getting drinks. \\n\\nMy cousin was doing the robot (haha) and then taking a picture with these dudes...and then the next second, he's ready to fight them for whatever reason. Good times. I told him I wasn't ready for a 6 v. 2 battle, but maybe after two more $15 shots of Patron I would be.",
        "I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!",
        "One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!",
        "We came here since we were at the airport right by. This is a smaller Chipotle but it was sooooooo clean and the service was great!\\nPlus I'm always a fan of chipotles and this one definitely represents the company in a great way!\\n\\nYum!",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "I really had high expectations for this place given how everyone before me raved about it. Plus I have been traveling to research dishes when I open my own izakaya restaurant. \\n\\nOf course, my friend and I come here after being at LAX, so we may have gotten in on the tail-end of it all. Overall, it was not bad. Seems like the type of place you go with friends to drink and be merry. Not the culinary adventure I was expecting.",
        "Me and a friend went here for dinner after he lost a bet on the pool table. The place was very quiet and not busy at all because it was fairly late on a week night. Service was fantastic but the food was phenomenal. I certainly would recommend it and had no complaints at all except my friend who was a bit sore from losing the bet, I am sure my meal tasted better since it was free. Haha.",
        "This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays.",
        "Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service.",
        "Ehhhhhhh.\\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",
        "During marching season, my boyfriend and I went here nearly every Friday for date night. We still go every few Fridays, as we absolutely love it here! The food is delicious, especially the curry and coconut ice cream. The servers are always kind, they tend to try keeping conversations short and to the point. Its an extremely nice restaurant.",
        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "Worst service of my life. Slow service. Wasn't busy at all. Got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out. Save your money and go elsewhere.",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "We went here for a wedding reception. The food and drinks were excellent. I had the stuffed salmon with mashed potatoes and my man got the steak. Both were delicious!!!!! The restaurant was dark and quiet very nice for a romantic dinner away from the strip. I met the owner in the restroom, she was very nice and friendly :)",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",
        "Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price.",
        "Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\\\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \\\"meh\\\".",
        "My favorite after work hangout!  \\n\\nAlways consistent with the food quality and taste.  There was only one time my food didn't come out the same and the manager came out to help me replace the order or to take it off my bill.

Either way, the atmosphere here is great on the weekends.  The patio is big and has a bar but the shape of it makes it just a little awkward when its busy.",
        "Horrible service! Do not come here ever. One time I came to the store 15 mins before their closing time and they didn't let me in. Another day I came 40 mins before they closed and they were rushing me to the cashier the whole time. Super rude! Also, one day I asked for the price of an item and she said \\\"I don't know\\\" and walked away.",

Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return.",
        "Well I can't really say anything seeing as I wasn't able to get in. I know they do not take reservations and it is walk in only. I tried calling to see what the wait time would be and nobody answered the phone. I was transferred to hotel concierge who wasn't able to get ahold of anyone either. So far not a good impression. I'll try again another time",

He took his time and did a phenomenal job with 2 repairs in my home. I would call him again in a second.",
        "Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.",

Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.",

We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook.

They do offer other selections other than sushi.",

        "Wunderbare Filme in heimeliger Atmosph\\u00e4re, ein typisches Programmkino mit dem dazugeh\\u00f6rigen Publikum. Hin und wieder muss man eben auch Filme mit nur 18 weiteren Personen im Saal ansehen. Daf\\u00fcr ist die Schauburg genau das richtige.",
        "Vegetarian or not, your will love this place!\\nThey serve reinvented classics as well as unique vegetarian et vegan dishes. \\nI could pick randomnly anything on the menu and be happy!\\n\\nThe service is not always impeccable, but always very friendly!\\n\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone!",
        "I ordered a Belgian waffle which was good.  My sister ordered the chicken strips and fries.  Her plate was mainly filled with fries.  My friend ordered a milkshake and we wondered where her silver mixing cup was with the rest of the milkshake.  Our waitress was a bit on the slow side and she was not very polite.  The food was good, the service could have been better.  It was funny looking at all the different outfits the employees were wearing.",
        "I love this place because of a few reasons. They have pretty good sushi for the boxed ones and they can make me rolls without avocado with no complaints because I'm allergic. The service is quick and friendly. It's a fast way to grab something to eat when you're on the go.",
        "Had curry noodles with chicken, as spicy as they make it. It was pretty spicy, but I wasn't crying and sweating from my forehead like a few of the other good pad Thai places around Vegas. Chicken and vegetables were fresh and simple. I will have this again for sure. Eat it with chop sticks,everything just falls off the fork. \\nVery nice atmosphere, very friendly, extremely attentive staff.",
        "Always a great place to stay.\\nVery clean, and attentive.\\nThey offer free Internet and a great Tapas bar to unwind from a long day away from home and family. \\n\\nWhen traveling on personal trips the hinton would be my go to hotel, very close to Metro and other fine dining.",
        "This place is always packed whenever I come here.  It's good, typical do-it-youself yogurt stand.  Nice staff.  I like that they have games here, it makes for a fun night out with the family.",

        "I've only been here a few times, but I have never been disappointed. Excellent customer service and ALWAYS amazing food. If you love yourself, order the acai berry smoothie and the Smoked Turkey & Avocado sandwich. Best items on the menu, as far as I'm concerned :)",
        "Had the stairs cleaned in my condo today by Rob. FANTASTIC JOB!  Rob was professional, friendly and very hard working.  \\n\\nWhile I have \\\"self-cleaned\\\" my condo stairs before, the job that Rob did was far better than I could ever have done.  Efficient, friendly, cost-effective are only a few words I can say!\\n\\nThank YOU, ROB!!!  I will recommend you highly!",
        "Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming.",
        "Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\\\" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.\\nI don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre.",
        "I have eaten there in the past and the food was decent. I took mu wife there this weekend and ordered grilled fish tacos. They were terrible. Really no fish. Just a very small amount of this disgusting chopped up fish stuff. Not even sure it was fish. A weird color. Basically I paid 12.95 for lettuce and cheese tacos with beans and rice. I will never go back. Not one person asked me how my food was. Probably knew the answer.",
        "10:30am - 2:30pm. The deli side is open!  They have the best sandwiches!  I recommend the ham and cheese on pretzel bread or the turkey and avocado.  As soon as you step in Eugene makes you feel welcome, is helpful and genuinely glad to serve you!"

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",

I notice that the dining area has become more formal than it used to be but the atmosphere and food are still fantastic.  Their peach bellini's are yummy and all the food super delicious!",

        "1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",

I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "Finally! A dollar store that fits the bill! This shop is nice and clean. Tidy. No mess. Great product assortment and variety of goods too. Had everything in stock that I was looking for. I really like the wide aisles to maneuver your shopping cart. Clerks were available and ready to help too. Oh, and my wait in line was just a few seconds. High five to this Dollar Tree store.. Keep it up!!",

        "Tao was so lame.  It was way too crowded, no room to dance or simply walk past.  I saw very few hot guys, mostly a bunch of corny ass dudes.  If you go, get extremely faded beforehand so you don't notice how lame it is when you walk in.  On the bright side, if you're a hot girl you'll get in free.",

        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",
        "As always, the peril cornbread appetizer is a delicious meal.  Unless you  have a big appetite..you will be pleasantly full from this one dish.  The chile rellenos is awesomely different.  \\n Located in downtown Phoenix, it is fun to sit outside and peoplewatch.",
        "Good spot on Mill to try a wide variety of beers.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable of the beers, which is important in a place like this.\\n\\nIt is a bit loud but they do have an upstairs area that I would recommend if you're with friends and want to have a conversation.",

        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "Food is alright. Had the mac and cheese and country green beans. The biscuits were good. Sis was insistent on trying it and since we were crunched on time we took it to-go. Took a while for the take out and prices are pretty high for the quality.",
        "Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "Great spot to find a wide variety of records, and most other things music related! They also have guitars and amps, and everything is priced fairly.

        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "Easily one of my favorite places in Arizona, let alone Tempe.  And that's from day one... (I was pretty late to the Cornish Party).  The atmosphere is unbeatable... feels like I'm in San Fran or London.  The steak / blue cheese pasty is fannnnnnnntastic.",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",
        "My previous review was very harsh, but true.  I met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect.  I have had nothing but poor service previously, but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter.  So, I'm upping the stars, hopefully the service keeps improving.",

The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",
        "Pretty good area! Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat. Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.\\n\\nI prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.",
        "Used to be better. Beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it. Walnut shrimp over cooked. Chicken Tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken. Yuck!",
        "Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.",
        "Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.",
        "Great deal for breakfast/lunch. The food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you weren't eating straight heavy fat. GO HERE!",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Nope-not authentic, pre-prepared, the chips are way too greasy and flavorless, and every entree tastes the same as every other entree. I went there with a party of five.l tasted everyone's entree. Tasted like we were all eating the same thing.\\nI have not had authentic Mexican anywhere in Madison. I'm told by my friend from Mexico, that yellow cheese is not used in Mexican food, nor are black olives.",
        "A student-friendly take on the whole style bar thing that would have looked and felt quite modern and interesting about 8 years ago, but now just feels lazy.\\n\\nJust like the slovenly, disinterested staff, whom oddly enough I actually warmed to due to their sheer indifference. Having worked behind bars myself, and felt exactly like them doing it, a trip to Koko invariably ends up feeling like a trip down memory lane.",
        "We've ordered cupcakes from Treehouse on two occassions.  We've had lemon blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, and churro.  All were wonderful.  The mini cupcakes are the perfect bite.  Highly recommend.",
        "Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.",

        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.",
        "Get some late night dessert here and receive free entry to the club. The desserts here are so pretty, that you'll have to take a picture before you take a bite. Too bad the dessert doesn't make up for the lame club there have here afterwards. The music is wack and I just can't dance to wack music.",
        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient.",

        "This is a decent place to grab a bite to eat. On two occasions the steak was purple in the middle not only did the manager come and comp my meal but replaced it with a free steak which was filet for free and gave me free drinks. I understand when your busy that you try to fly out food as fast as possible and the only problem with that is make sure that the meat is cooked. The manager made up for everything though and the food if prepared correctly is great",
        "Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.

Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "I was really looking forward to eating here based on all the reviews. But my husband and I were really disapointed. The food was just okay.

Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate.",
        "OMG, great burgers! I fell onto this place, after shopping in the mall area.  I ordered the Phoenix and my daughter the Portabello Mushroom. Both were delicious, although I favored mine (with the jalapenos). Didn't care for the skinny fries with sea salt, as they had very little flavor and were dried out.",

        "I've been back 4 times since my initial visit, but today's lunch merits a star reduction, due to the underwhelming special tostada today, which was probably 50% imitation crab meat, instead of the promised variety on their special tostada.  The San Diego tostada was still delicious, but I will begrudge them the krab I reluctantly consumed.",
        "It's a pretty big Walmart. Has its own deli among other things, a Wetzel's Pretzels and a McDonalds. Plus this place is open 24 hours (not the deli and McDonald's). Classic Walmart prices as well.\\n\\nNot a bad place for Black Friday either. Everything mainstream is partitioned in the center aisles rather than their usual locations. Helps get the chaos over with quickly.",
        "One Of my favorite bars in Pgh:) they have a wide variety of beers on tap and there is always specials running everyday of the week... Appetizers are delicious, burgers are well stacked and sum pretty yummy wings! you can buy the sacuses for the wings which is amazing!! I recomend the teriyaki or the honey BBQ wings!",

        "Definitely pub-like, in a cavernous sort of way. Good Strongbow on tap is a plus. Ordered the Confit Duck Legs on Whole Wheat with Black Truffle Mayo and Todd English BBQ sauce. Also had the New England Fish & Chips. Although definitely not \\\"pub\\\" prices, very delicious and somewhat worth it. Lots of interesting foods on the menu to try. \\n\\nVery good food and fun place to hang out.",

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "Had fried tofu, fried pork, peanut butter dumplings and eggplant. The fried foods were dry and tough. Pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in Montreal. Only try this if you're desperate for Chinese. (The pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood.)",
        "This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now.",
        "Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria.",
        "The incline is attractive, but the staff were universally rude and treated the customers much like cattle.",
        "Their beer sampler is fun way to sample their good beers and have fun at the same time. I thought their fish fry was really good, too.\\n\\nIf you're going to dine there during warm month, try the pretty outside garden seating and make sure to share appetizer with friends for start of a nice evening to ensue.",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain.",

        "Really gorgeous breakfast, everything looked good, but the pancakes were divine! Massive portions, but that's America! Taste was exceptional, one of the best places, for breakfast, I've ever eaten. The price was very good, about $40 for coffees and 2 lots of pancakes and that's including a generous, although normal, tip for America. Great atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Don't be put off by the queue; it moves quickly.",
        "We stopped in for breakfast.  The prices were high for very marginal food....frozen potatoes that weren't even served warm.  Food didn't seem very fresh either.  Left with that heavy, ugh feeling.",

The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.",
        "We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??",
        "Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.",
        "The food was pretty good. The service was pretty good. The problem was that it didn't really fit the Bellagio feel, it was like a straight up diner (not a cafe) in a fancy hotel.\\n\\nExpect a diner, not a cafe.",
        "The food was pretty descent for the most part. My biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok.",

The service was great and very friendly. They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it, so totally worth the extra calories :)",
        "I have been here many many times and it never gets old. The hardest part about being there is trying to choose what rolls you want.  Its a pretty small place, which I love.... its very ambient and relatively romantic.\\n\\nNever had a problem with service or waiting either.",
        "Loved this place. \\n\\nWe had a great time, it took us about an hour; but honestly that's all the time that we had as we got there at 4, and it closed at 5. \\n\\nIt was pretty cool to see the history of Andy Warhol - certificates and pictures from his life, along with notes and of course his art. \\n\\nVery memorable, and I'm glad I got to see it.",
        "We are in Vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just can't find anywhere else. Yayo Taco was excellent!!! I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go...",

        "The BBQ is decent, depending on what you get (the brisket is meh, the chicken is pretty good, the ribs are decent).  The Saturday college football viewing is nice.  The service is friendly, even when your kids are making a huge mess.  It's definitely going in the Saturday afternoon rotation.",

I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized...",

        "Small quaint little airport. Pretty nice not the fanciest. You can gamble if you like there. Luggage is weird. You have to take a train to another area to get your luggage. Shuttle to the strip is easy and cheap, 7 dollars one way. Better then driving and cheaper and more relaxing.",
        "Spicy tuna roll is pretty good, big pieces of tuna, not the usual mayo mix. Nice sushi chefs, good happy hour prices, not a large sushi selection though.  (They did tell me they were in the process of expanding it.)",
        "Rachel's Kitchen has a small selection wraps and burgers which are all pretty good. Where they really excel is with the smoothies. Highly recommend.",
        "Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!",
        "This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9.",
        "Great location for finding better clothes. I have found East Mesa, South Gilbert, Chandler, and Northwest Scottsdale to have the best clothing at these Goodwills! I love 50% saturdays and service is usually pretty good! Just try to beat the crowd early on the 50% saturdays or go later in the day.",

Pretty hard getting drinks. \\n\\nMy cousin was doing the robot (haha) and then taking a picture with these dudes...and then the next second, he's ready to fight them for whatever reason. Good times. I told him I wasn't ready for a 6 v. 2 battle, but maybe after two more $15 shots of Patron I would be.",
        "Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.",
        "I thought this place was pretty cool old school arcade games and a bar. Its a pretty good combination.",
        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "Pretty solid soup dumplings, and definitely worth the price, but I prefer the location on Lincoln.",

        "The side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing, but the sandwiches I've tried so far have been pretty bland.  I love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though.  It's a nice atmosphere",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment.",
        "this tj is pretty awesome. great finds here; i even found bliss bath products one otherwise unmemorable afternoon! clean and organized with helpful staff. men's selection is particularily good at this store. shoes always seem over priced whether they be men's or women's. bags, accessories and even jewelry selections are interesting and don't look like leftovers. overall, a great store with great prices. i'm definitely a fan.",
        "The food here was pretty good. But the service was very slow. And we had a cranky kid with us which you would think would speed them up a little bit. But that didn't help. They don't have high chairs or boasters so I would say this place is NOT kid friendly. If you want to try it leave the little ones at home for this one.",
        "The rocking chairs are genius!\\n\\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\\n\\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \\n\\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \\n\\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20.",
        "Food was pretty good. Nothing too unique or memorable besides the decor, and the 60s music absolutely killed the mood. They need to keep with the theme and have instrumental chill music. Ciabatta chicken sandwich was ok. Bread lacked the traditional ciabatta flavor. Sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. Hummus was pretty good, though the pita tasted a bit raw?",
        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",
        "It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.",
        "Awesome!  Pizza rocks!  Pasta is great homemade stuff.  Really different than pretty much Italian type restaurants.",
        "The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \\n\\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.",
        "We went here for a wedding reception. The food and drinks were excellent. I had the stuffed salmon with mashed potatoes and my man got the steak. Both were delicious!!!!! The restaurant was dark and quiet very nice for a romantic dinner away from the strip. I met the owner in the restroom, she was very nice and friendly :)",
        "Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\\\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \\\"meh\\\".",
        "Love this place! Been to pretty much all the Pho spots in the valley and this spot is authentic. As for customer service, I really enjoy having my order taken and not being bothered while I enjoy my dinner HOT. Affordable, delicious and the broth is aaaamaazzziiiinnngggg.",
        "I have two free meals here and can't seem to bring myself to going. \\n\\nAnyone want to try it risk free? Pm me and I will arrange the details.",

        "Tastes like home made! Better in some cases.. \\nThe tortillas tasted absolutely amazing, the carne asada was great. You gotta try the breakfast burritos. Customer service was great, our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas.",
        "Food is alright. Had the mac and cheese and country green beans. The biscuits were good. Sis was insistent on trying it and since we were crunched on time we took it to-go. Took a while for the take out and prices are pretty high for the quality.",
        "Tried Archies cafe for the first time. The service was great and the food was the best Tai food I've had so far. I ordered the Pad Tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter. It is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant.",
        "Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  \\n\\nAnd definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.\\n\\nI'll be back again!!",
        "Since it is an older establishment, they are starting some renovations starting in the casino, which is where I have been at. The gambling atmosphere is pretty good, they have dancing girls which is cool. A nice classic touch are the Flamingo girls who stand outside waiting for you to take a picture with them. Party on!",
        "They don't do AYCE :( but prices are reasonable otherwise..since we pretty much ONLY do all you can eat, we won't be back. Picked up a few rolls to go and quality was okay, not the best.",
        "I had the sausage pizza and thought it was great. I think the menu described it as a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the sausage is from Chicago, but this is not deep dish. Actually pretty thin. But I definitely liked it and would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. I was there too late for it, but they were advertising half off pizza during the late afternoon.",
        "I love all of the cupcakes!  They are so pretty and ridiculously delicious!  I am so happy they are so close to my house.  If you have not tried this place you definitely should!  You will not be disappointed.",
        "Pretty good... Not as good as \\\"Wahoos\\\" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.",
        "Totally disappointing, especially after dinner at SW the night before. \\n\\nEverything was pretty average. The short rib was one of the worst I have had. \\n\\nService was decent, but would have liked to have enjoyed the food. ;(",
        "It was pretty much what I expected except for the mermaids. Kind of a let down not to see them but still nice to see and very relaxing to sit next to with the pro shop waterfall in the background. Overall it was a nice change from the overcrowded strip for a change.",
        "Great quality and selection of workout, yoga and athletic apparel.  Not your typical, lame stuff you find at the generic sports stores. The owners & staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful.",
        "A bit overpriced, both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry....  This place also does not have a friendly vibe....  It's pretty pretentious.  Good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air...",
        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible.  \\n\\nThe girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",
        "I just ate here and I order some garlic shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp was so over cooker, it was super hard and I could even taste where it was burnt on the edges. The garlic, needless to say, was also very burnt. I pretty much didn't like the salsa and beans all too much and I generally could have had a much better dining experience here.",
        "Easily one of my favorite places in Arizona, let alone Tempe.  And that's from day one... (I was pretty late to the Cornish Party).  The atmosphere is unbeatable... feels like I'm in San Fran or London.  The steak / blue cheese pasty is fannnnnnnntastic.",
        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere.",
        "I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.",
        "Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive).",
        "This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.",
        "We like to go here for Tapas happy hour!  Fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharing.\\n\\nIt's a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza (there's a kid's menu).  \\n\\nService is usually pretty good.",
        "This food was pretty terrible and overpriced.  I would not go back.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "Just went tonight with coworkers as we're staying right in the area, apparently both of them had been here before and thought of it fairly highly. Food was good, I had the lamb shank which was pretty well done for a brewpub. Beer was also pretty tasty as well, especially the seasonal porter and the regular wit. Service was pretty friendly so I would come back.",
        "We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.",
        "Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning",
        "Pretty good area! Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat. Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.\\n\\nI prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "In vegas, every restaurant is pretty good... but N9NE does it better with little things... things like the best atmostphere, a simple menu where they focus on things they can do well, smores, one of the best and freshest seafood platters I've ever had, etc. etc."

        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "Very efficient and a good value.  I booked online just prior to flight departure.  Good directions to get to the shuttle, very short wait and in the hotel in less than 30 min from  landing (no bags).  On departure they were actually a few minutes early for pickup but sent a text telling me they were waiting.  Would definitely use Super Shuttle again.",
        "Hurray for happy hour! 98 South has an awesome happy hour and you should totally go.\\n\\nGet a dirty martini, red red wine and half price appetizers. Usually on Monday nights they have an awesome couple playing jazz. They're really cool man.\\n\\nCheers.",
        "$30 for adults even though the sign outside says $21.99. This price also includes bottomless mimosas. The line is never long and you pay through a machine to get in.\\n\\nThe best items in the meat section were the prime rib, bacon, and bacon bits. The best desert item was carrot cake. Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "Don't stay here. The room was in poor condition upon check-in. The restroom smelled like someone took a massive dump. The sheet was stained red which I am hoping is from cranberry juice. Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.",
        "Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in.",
        "I've seen holiday inns better than this.  It's filthy. Stained carpets, stuff sitting out in the hallways. Market doors, peeling paint, you can smell dust and mold.  Waited in SPG line for over 20 minutes to check in. Ridiculous. Got to room and change immediately. Wifi was horrible as well. There is not one good thing about this hotel. I'm here for business and its been a long time since I've seen something this bad.",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "I took my car there yesterday after it stalled at a red light. The staff there greeted me almost immediately and ran a test on the car. He identified the problem and was able to fix it right away. I was in and out within ptetty quickly considering. Very professional and gave me the information I needed to make a decision on what services were needed. No pushing or pressure to get services. Thanks Jiffy Lube! I will definitely be back!",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "this tj is pretty awesome. great finds here; i even found bliss bath products one otherwise unmemorable afternoon! clean and organized with helpful staff. men's selection is particularily good at this store. shoes always seem over priced whether they be men's or women's. bags, accessories and even jewelry selections are interesting and don't look like leftovers. overall, a great store with great prices. i'm definitely a fan.",

Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!",
        "Salsa verde, cilantro, pork crackling. You can't ask for anything better. Surprisingly dioecious authentic Mexican food. Excellent drink and food selection. Having grown up on Mexican food, this is certainly up to standard. Good ambiance, too.",
        "For the food, price & service this place has to be the best gyro restaurant in Avondale. It's a little hidden gem in this neighborhood. Food is always good. The service is always fantastic. The two young men behind the counter are always friendly & efficient. Definitely one of my favorite places!",
        "28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word \\\"Express\\\" from your signage.",
        "This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",
        "A bit overpriced, both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry....  This place also does not have a friendly vibe....  It's pretty pretentious.  Good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air...",
        "The pizza is so good that I forgive them for being Red Sox fans and will continue to eat there despite all the Red Sox posters. So if a New Yorker can tolerate Red Sox paraphernalia the Pizza has to be good!",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",
        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",
        "Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "No doubt that the coffee was excellent- but the barista was rude and very cantankerous, despite attempts at being friendly. Not to mention the bathroom was out of toilet paper and just had a sign that said 'sorry- public bathrooms available down the street'. I wish I could give a better review since their coffee is great- but the experience was lackluster.",
        "Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.",
        "I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.",
        "Disappointed... Went in with a friend, my coffee was quite bitter, and the service was unpleasant. It took 30 min to get our sandwhich while other customers walked out with their food in hand. This is my second bad experience so I doubt I will be returning. :(",
        "I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.\\n\\nPoor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.",
        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",
        "Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty. I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty. I ordered a few of there specialty rolls such as the Lobster roll and the Eel and Avocado roll. They were both good but nothing really that amazing to make me go back. They do offer other selections other than sushi.",
        "Great breakfasts, veerrry attentive staff, and dog-friendly!  What else can I say?\\n\\nOh yeah, wonderful patio with outdoor bar, and quaint French-inspired bathrooms (waterclosets? :) ).",
        "It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.",
        "This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!",
        "Andrea is professional and efficient--as painless as a wax can be.  It's easy to set an appointment with her and she is always quick to respond to my texts.  I've been going to her for over a year and think her service is great. Pricing is reasonable and oftentimes you can get a groupon!   I highly recommend her to others.",
        "Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,",
        "One word. Nasty! Take a walk to burger bar at Mandalay shoppes better service and way better food!!!!",
        "Gross. Gross, gross, gross. \\nNot my choice to dine here. The food is super greasy, inauthentic, and unpleasant. Even the fruit cup had stupid fruit- you know, the kind that's not ripe and isn't varied. \\n\\nThere are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, and not all of them are expensive. If you're using yelp, please, go find a better spot for breakfast.",
        "Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare.",
        "I haven't stayed here but I've been inside. Hotel looks really nice. Nice lobby and very well decorated. Its located at a descent location on the Strip. However, their casino isn't the best. If you are a gambler, might wanna hit up some other casinos.",
        "I'm in Sun City visiting my mom, and apparently this is a favorite of she and her husband. I'm absolutely stunned, as they usually have decent taste. Thus place was truly terrible.  The only redeeming quality was that it was relatively clean.",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline.",
        "I never really liked this place. Every time I dined here I always had a bad meal. Not worth the money. The seafood dishes are bad and the meat dishes are even worse. I think Red Lobster is better, not by much. Save your money and do not even come here.",
        "Took a chance and stopped at this Barros my original place is on thunderbird I regret it!! Cashier was rude asf once you get that nasty attitude walking in and having them take your order in a rude matter you can't enjoy your stay there and can't help NOT coming back to this location. (No name tag on the cashier)",

Equally as good as the other Pho restaurants we've frequented here in the valley - and the price is right.  $24 for 2 people, no drinks, ate until we were full.  We will definitely be back!",
        "Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible.",

        "The checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked. No ventilation, as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room. Then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places. Not recommended.",
        "Looking around town for Jin's chicken and fish which wasn't in its normal Francis location we found this spot. Fulfilling after bar chicken/fish sandwiches. Would never go here for a meal but it's a perfect after bar spot. I got a chicken sandwich which was basically two chicken fingers drenched in Franks Red Hot, mayo, tiny lettuce piece on a thin hamburger bun. Did the trick for what I wanted.",
        "There was basically no cheese on my \\\"cheese combo sandwich\\\", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us.",
        "I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake.",
        "I was pleasently surprised. I haven't had good crepe in a while. The avalon was pretty amazing and not too heavy on the goat cheese. Somehow it was just the way I liked it. \\nThe environment is cute and quant (Even their bathrooms) \\nThe best part was the their service. The place is really small, but he staff will go out if their way to find a seat for you.\\nI'll definitely be coming  back",
        "I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall.  You then get the sight and sound.",
        "I ordered a chophouse burger for dinner this evening along with the bottomless root beer float. We hadn't been to Red Robin in quite sometime mainly owing to having outrageously busy work schedules. The burger was excellent but I drank too many floats before it arrived. It was nice to receive a red royalty discount of 10% off the bill.\\n(4/7/13)",
        "really fresh Hamachi, Uni and red snapper sashimi and other raw creations by chef John.  Matcha Tiramisu really hit the spot after some great Sushi.  Definitely will come back to try their happy hour and lunch menu.",
        "We use to love this place, but the food - value ratio is on the decline. We had the thin crust pizza and it tasted like crackers with red sauce. We enjoy the live music and warm tea on the patio at sunset, but it has changes so much. I am not sure if we will give it another try, very disappointed.",
        "Got in for free on Thursday night. The music was honestly the BEST when no one else was on the floor. So that's why it was just me and my girl dancing on the floor. The moment the hip hop came on, it was mixed so badly that i just was annoying.You couldn't really get into it to make much of a dance. But very nicely decorated and $15 martinis!",
        "Wow!  Happy hour wings are the best!  Nachos portion is huge and great price for what you get.  You may need to keep on your server cause it's a little hectic in there but happy hour is the way to go here... My kids love the lazer tag and video games!  Not bad for little Surprise ;)\\n\\nDon't expect the waitresses to be quick.  Ours was very slow.",
        "The wheels completely fell of this place!  After enduring a number of weeks here for work I finally gave up living in the slum and moved to a much better location right around the corner.  \\n\\nOne to many mornings with a cold shower, cigarette burnt bedding, mystery stained towels, and horrible smells in the hallways.",
        "I was in the mood for a salad and looking at their menu I decided to go here. Nice place inside, very clean and decorated in blue and white. I ordered the Greek Salad with Gyro meat and no onions. I didn't get any of the olives either, bummer. My wife ordered a Pita with no onions and as she took a bite noticed onions. The service was decent, your average wait staff, pretty friendly",
        "Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends.",
        "$25 worth of trash. Look at the picture. We waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container here's the real show",

        "Great coffee and snack selection.  They are friendly and efficient.  I usually end up here more than I expect because Einstein Bagels next door tends to let me down, so I walk right over here and they consistently great.",
        "This place is always consistently good.  They obviously have a great beer selection on tap, but the food is also very good.  The jalapeno popper burger is awesome and something I've never seen anywhere else.  Service is always friendly and efficient.\\n\\nAnd of course, you can get six-packs to go.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "8 of us just finished eating here.  Service was very friendly, prices were definitely reasonable, and we all really enjoyed our meals. \\n\\nI would come back again for sure!\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn't snap any photos of our food, but here are a few of the place.",
        "The first and last time I went, this place was crowded. It seemed a little out of date to me, and the people that were here didn't speak English and let their children run around barefoot while screaming. (Not trying to be racist at all, that kind of behavior is just annoying) Needless to say, I'm sure I can find a better place to do laundry until my landlord fixes my dryer.",
        "Dinner here with family members. Large, varied menu. Heather was our server. She was pleasant and efficient. I had the ribs and salad  bar. Salad bar had a good selection of veggies and dressings. Ribs were OK but not stellar. Mashed potatoes were real and gravy was tasty.. I want to try the chicken fried chicken sometime. My sister had the blt and it was loaded with bacon.",

        "Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!",
        "Pool was terrific.  Room was great.  Old Town Scottsdale was a trip.  Me and my girlfriend had an absolute blast.\\nSpecial note*** Aurora at the front desk took great care of us.  She even surprised us by buying a bottle of red wine for my girlfriend on her birthday!  Who does that?!  High recommendations.",
        "Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town.",
        "This was the first and last time that I will go to Red Robin.  The waitress, named Katie, was terrible.  The restaurant was only half full, but she took forever to come to our table.    I ordered a black and blue burger. It was just awful and terribly over-priced,  even the tea tasted bad,  I actually left thirsty.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",
        "This is a pretty big buffet but it's pretty gross. It's reminds me of the old school Vegas buffets, before they got fancy. It's a big long line of trays which makes jumping to and from items pretty difficult. Expect nasty little kids running all over and fatties trying to jump in front of you for the last piece of fried chicken. The ONLY reason to get this buffet is if it's free.",
        "I scheduled an appointment with the Dr. He never came in. The PA came in for 5 minutes. He barely did a physical exam. Never even tested for reflexes! Complained to the office manager. Had to track her down and keep calling to reach her. Horrible practicioners and patient service. I found another Dr. Complete different attitude. She did a complete physical exam and spent time with me. Never go to AZ Center for Pain!!!",
        "Not very impressed. The crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza. The sauce was not very flavorful and didn't have any spices to it. I had to add a bunch of crushed red peppers to get some kick into it. The cheese was good and tasted real, but the mushrooms seemed like they were from a can. $23.78 for a 13\\\" medium pizza to go, was way more than this was worth. Disappointed.",
        "Top service for my slowly leaking tyre in my hire car. Quick and efficient, and CHEAP. No bullshit either. They patched the tyre and all is well. I thought it might have taken a while and went across the road to the Del Tacos to get some lunch (we were starving) and by the time we got back 30 mins later it was all fixed and ready to go. If you need tyres and you're in Vegas, go here.",
        "Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \\\"home\\\", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service.",
        "I concur with several other customers commenting on the owner. We frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner, that was it for us.  Unpleasant and Rude is an understatment. It's not the way we want to spend a nice evening.",
        "After 30 mins of waiting for two open seats I finally got one.  We sat right in the middle in the second row of tables.  The first few acts were alright, I wouldn't quite describe it as incredibly ground breaking, but there are some interesting displays of light and precision choreography.  Other than that, there's not much you can do with a bunch of similarly-shaped women and sub-par acting.",
        "Stayed here for the first time.. Fabulous!  Great atmosphere... Friendly staff, clean hotel & rooms!  Only down side is there are no shower curtains in the showers... It's cold out there!  They said the architect they had said its the new style!  Oh well. Everything else was great!!",
        "I have been wanting to try City Tavern for a while now. I feel as if I should have tried them years ago. It almost seems as if the restaurant may be cutting corners. The food is subpar. Most of what I had was previously frozen. My egg roll was cold in the middle and the calamari was incredibly chewy. My \\\"sushi grade\\\" tuna was pink, not red. It was basically over priced bar fare."

Good for a quick stop, but there are much better options when looking for a full flavored, spicy, authentic gordita. The service was very friendly and the restaurant spotlessly clean, almost antiseptic.",

Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $18, with a spicy tuna roll.\\nFelt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though.",
        "Wanted to like this joint...yelp reviewers were positive...but sheesh, cannot\\nrecommend anything.  Service was awful & taco corn tortillas were hard &\\nbrittle.  Fillings were below par too.",
        "Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there.",
        "La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.",
        "Never order steak here! It was tough and not good quality for its price.  Steak was also bland and it was almost well done :(",
        "This was literally the worse buffet food I have ever had and really has no place on the Vegas Strip. The food was bland, poorly presented and of medicore quality. The line layout is inefficient and confusing and the dessert table was like something at a gas stations snack area. Not even worth it when its free.",
        "Restaurant sympa, la nourriture est bonne et originale mais l'ambiance est un peu froide et le service impersonnel.",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!",
        "A mom n pop kinda place.  Small, pho was good, shrimp roll was okay...but then againI grew up in Toronto, Canada where we have a huge Vietnamese population and pho places are everywhere, cheap and tasty!\\nSatisfied my pho craving while in Scottsdale.",
        "Man I LOVE this place! I really hope they do well! You will not find better Mexican food and a more laid back relaxed atmosphere!!! They only thing they need to do is put sand on the floor! Great beer and booze selections! I will be back again and again.",
        "Before I finally tried this place, a couple people told me this was the best noodles in Vegas. I has the T. Shoyu noodles & Takana fried rice. Both were filling & okay, but I thought pho was more satisfying. Don't think I'll be back. I tried seeing if they had siracha hot sauce, but the server ignored me. These are only my opinions, perhaps many others think Monta is one of the best as well.",
        "Decided to try this place out after we saw a movie at the galaxy theatre. We just got one chocolate cake pop for $2.50 although it was good I thought the $2.50 was a little much.  I can go to Showboy BakeShop in Anthem and get an entire cupcake for the same amount.",
        "The side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing, but the sandwiches I've tried so far have been pretty bland.  I love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though.  It's a nice atmosphere",
        "this tj is pretty awesome. great finds here; i even found bliss bath products one otherwise unmemorable afternoon! clean and organized with helpful staff. men's selection is particularily good at this store. shoes always seem over priced whether they be men's or women's. bags, accessories and even jewelry selections are interesting and don't look like leftovers. overall, a great store with great prices. i'm definitely a fan.",
        "Food is just good, not great. Vanilla custard French toast is good. Omelets are a little bland. Corn beef hash was sweet and spicy...it is made in house.",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Chimichangas are very good and filling....couldn't finish it. The salsa was decent and slightly spicy.  Had a peach Margarita...very yummy and strong.",
        "Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.",
        "Crap..... giving two stars only because waitress was helpful. Shrimp is extremely fishy and everyone else's food was bland.",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\\\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \\\"meh\\\".",
        "Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "Located within treasure island. It's an odd combo a pho shop and coffee shop. I only ordered a Cobb salad $15 and service seemed good, unlike other reviews.  The salad was decent and serving size was large. We spilt the salad between two people  and it was enough food.  I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the pasta dishes and the infamous Grandma 'za. Oh, and for uptown this is unusual - parking is actually a viable option, and it's free.",
        "Pizza is good.  Got the pasta and it was bland not thrilled with the salad either",
        "Tried the eclairs..chocolate & vanilla.  Absolutely wonderfull!  The vanilla was made with real vanilla beans, no extract or flavoring.  Filling was light & creamy.  Moderate pricing for such a high quality product.  The eclairs cost $5.00 for the two and each eclair was about eight inches long.  I would've gladly paid $5.00 for just one!",
        "Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.",
        "Don't be afraid to try this place out for size. The rooms are small (as all older hotel rooms are) but well appointed. The casino itself has a vintage appeal with alot of historic items on display. the 777 Brewery is suberb and will exceed your expectations. No pool though.",
        "The rolled tacos were like chewing hard rubber and the carne asada burrito had a stale tortilla around bland meat.\\n\\nHaving enjoyed Robertos in other cities, I was very disappointed in the quality here and will not be back.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "The flavors and toppings were okay.\\nI was a little disappointed how few non-fat options there were.\\nThey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes.",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "Here's the quick and dirty. I can see how some people may like it here. However if you've ever had a real crepe this place won't do it for you. The toppings are very standard although they have lots, it's all sweet or sweeter nothing really exciting or new happening here.",
        "Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.",
        "ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!",
        "Second time coming here this week-delicious! I love the topping selection, how QUICK they cook your pizzas (I have a short lunch break), and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on. Yum!",
        "Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago.",
        "Oh No!!!! \\nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much.\\nWould not go here again......bye bye bob\\nFor that price go to charcoal room",
        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Female server lacked personality, didn't check on me except to bring me my food or water, and gave me my bill without even suggesting dessert. Cook forgot to make an item I ordered, and she didn't even notice!\\n\\nLIKE  The curry. The loco moco. The different sides and toppings. The desserts.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "This is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station.  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next train.\\n\\nOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage , egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads.  They had quite a few combinations.\\n\\nNext time I am back to this train station, this will be my go to breakfast place!",
        "It's a sandwich shop modeled on Subway, better than Subway, but it's still just a sandwich shop with deli-meat laden subs, wraps, fold em's and salads; no sides except chips; and cheap combo prices.  Filling and a good value, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe donut shop thingie encroaching on the dining area is just a bit odd.  Expensive little donuts.  How cool.",
        "Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places.",
        "It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!",
        "Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also",
        "I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.",
        "Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.",
        "Table of 4, wait was 20++ minutes late on a Thursday night.   No bar to wait in, plus no alert system (buzzer or whatever) so we couldn't wander around the casino.   Once we were seated, the food was great.....  Just burgers but lots of toppings, etc.   Nothing bad nor was it overly memorable.  Very sufficient for a bite in Harrahs!",

        "I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",
        "Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty. I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty. I ordered a few of there specialty rolls such as the Lobster roll and the Eel and Avocado roll. They were both good but nothing really that amazing to make me go back. They do offer other selections other than sushi.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.",
        "The chicken snitchel was the best! We got a combo to try weiner chicken and pork chop ...next time I will get just the chicken snitchel as the flavors were amazing!! We also started with the beef vegetable soup...took me back to my youth in England. Very authentic. The service and atmosphere was great too!",
        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "I've had better experiences at other churrascarias. the pork tenderloin and ham-and-pineapple selections were the only highlights.",
        "The sandwich filling options are good, but the bread is dry, crumbly, and tastes mass produced. With options like milio's and Jimmy john's so close by with much better bread, it's hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here.",
        "Pretty solid Korean food imo. Ordered the Gamjatang (meat was tender, broth was flavourful) and bibimbap (this also came with a soup which was nice!).\\n\\nWould recommend this place for a good Korean meal in Waterloo :)",
        "If you want a very filling and enjoyable sandwich for a great price, try out Capriottis.  The first sandwich I ever tried was a Bobby, which is Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and filling that I was full after half a sandwich.  You get a mix of turkey, gravy, stuffing, and more goodies.  There are other great hot sandwiches available as well.",
        "Not just coffee, but don't forget the tea!  Great loose leaf blends and knowledgeable staff to coach on steeping times and the varieties.  They could even cite the amount of caffeine in each. Very impressive.... cannot wait to try the coffee.",
        "RESTAURANT INFLEXIBLE. Reserved table for wine pairing dinner months in advance with the understanding that one of the party didn't eat meat. \\nTwo days before the dinner we were sent a menu which contained no options other than meat. The chef refused to alter her menu to add a non-meat option. \\nChef too self-important to accommodate clientele.",
        "The combos aren't combos and the guy behind the counter looks like he's gonna cry.  D,:",
        "Been there several times.   Greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Servers took orders quickly and knew the menu well.   Specials were related and all questions answered.\\n\\nFood served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.\\n\\nService seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently.",
        "Pie in the Sky's pizza is way better than Fuel's, hands down. I would absolutely recommend this place, especially if you need to order for an inexpensive business lunch. I have never been dissappointed! My favorite pizzas are the Supreme and the BBQ Chicken, but they are all good. Also, get the Greek salad. They don't skimp on toppings and the dressing is great. Love this place.",
        "I love that you can make your own samples here. It makes the experience so much easier and makes for a quicker decision!\\n\\nThey also have a great assortment of flavors and toppings. You can either go healthy and fruity, or decadent!\\n\\nAnd really cute spoons!",
        "I order the number two combo which is the combination burrito fries and a coke. The French fries at Del Taco are always good. the combination burrito was very small and bland. the first half of the burrito was all beans and the second half of the burrito was all meat. The place looked fairly clean and the workers seemed nice. I'm here for the food please lets get it right.",
        "Went here at 1am on Black Friday. The place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casino.\\n\\nOxtail Soup was the only thing worth trying. Ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside. Also tried the steak and it was pretty bland. One trick pony in my opinion.",
        "I will eat here when a friend insists, but I think almost every time I've eaten here, I have gotten diarrhea.  And the food isn't worth the diarrhea.  Its kind of bland.  And its overpriced.  Just my opinion though.  I know lots of people are ga-ga over this place.",
        "Oh Ya!!!! The most incredible bodies on the planet. Performance is impeccable and who knew the best pop-locking I've seen in a long time!! What a great surprise! True Cabaret!",
        "Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.",
        "There was basically no cheese on my \\\"cheese combo sandwich\\\", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us.",
        "I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake.",
        "I was the only customer, service good, the spaghetti sauce must of been out of a can plane as could be. Meatballs hard no taste. The Italian combo sub was like eating the sole of a shoe. The appetizer tomato.and garlic toast was very good. The atmosphere was nice. For $31 left very very DISAPPOINTED will NEVER GO BACK. I hope the owner reads this.",
        "I would go back.\\n\\nReminds me of a mom n pop stop.  People were friendly, service was pretty good.  The food wasn't anything to write home about but I did enjoy my meal.  I liked the casual setting and it's in a convenient complex with plenty of parking.",
        "A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the full tasting menu with one wine pairing.\\n\\nThe dishes were very original and the presentation of each dish was extraordinary!\\n\\nEverything was beyond our expectation!\\n\\nBravo!",
        "Yelp and Good Fellas  really came through for my family and I while we were off the beaten path looking for some good grub.  Good Fellas is very very good food.  They have a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is just about the food.  Try the two meat combo.  MMMMMM!  The lentil soup is excellant (try it with some lemon juice).  The only thing I did not like about the place is it is not in the east valley!",
        "I'm really amazed that this place is getting such great reviews. It is TERRIBLE. The food is bland and overly priced. The amount of pretention in the air from the staff is unbelievable. The service is poor, wait times even with reservations are not acceptable. I guess when people don't know what a good meal is, they just jump on the band wagon when one person somewhere talks about a 'cool, hip place'",
        "the portions are generous and the staff is friendly and helpful. but the food is just ok. nothing to write home about. i was really interested in going here for quite sometime, maybe that had something to do with why I thought the food was so bland. I had it built up in my head to be better than it was.",
        "Great little rest stop along the strip. Numerous selections in burger styles. I highly recommend the chili burger.",
        "Every time I come here, I want to leave with something.  The 16 international flavors of Coke is interesting.  It costs $7 and they give you a fair amount, so you could split it with like 2 or 3 otehr people.  Must try it.  Obviously a very touristy place but it's fun.",
        "There's not much to be said about the pizza here except that it is comparatively cheap, quick, and is no frills. Whether you're tired of overpaying for things on the strip or want to get late night grub without a reservation, this is your place. Free water and condiments, and you get to tease everyone at the Cosmopolitan with your cheap yet filling pizza. Can't go wrong.",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "Cadre sympathique, bon service et surtout de bonnes bi\\u00e8res",
        "This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time."

        "Had fried tofu, fried pork, peanut butter dumplings and eggplant. The fried foods were dry and tough. Pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in Montreal. Only try this if you're desperate for Chinese. (The pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood.)",
        "I really wish this review could be great because my wife and I love other mellow mushrooms were we have dined and very happy to have one now uptown. However, the Uptown location doesn't quite seem to be ready for prime time business.  Lack of staff but plenty of seating.  Be prepared to wait.  I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",
        "Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew.",
        "It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!",
        "Surprise this place doesn't have many reviews . Place stays busy.so on with my review . Well all I can say is there service is at perfection to me . I've heard and experience the horror storys that happens going to the wrong dry cleaners . Trust me that won't happen hear .",
        "I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in. It's about time to scale back the number of clients and/or appointments you take. Look, I've even had enough time to write this review AFTER reading all the others.",
        "I absolutely LOVE this place. I have been here several times after reading about it in las vegas weekly. the food is to perfection everytime! the prices are amazing for this type of quality of food. i LOVEEEE the sauce that they serve on the side of the arepas. they are to die for.",
        "My husband and I were totally impressed by the dining experience. Everything, from good quality, presentation to service are top notch. This is our first time dining at a Michelin 3 star restaurant and Joel Robuchon definitely lives up to its reputation.",
        "My ice chest was stolen from my room which had a coffee commuter cup, three cans of soda, milk, and spoon.  The Front Desk Staff was no help. \\\"Frank\\\" The weekend Manager in Charge  and The Security Officer were the only ones that were helpful.  There has been no follow up from the Motel 6 Staff at 195 East Tropicana Avenue, Las Vegas. I was staying there from September 08, 2011 Through September 10, 2011.",
        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",
        "A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",
        "This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",
        "Went here with the husband and our 2 teens and we all get something different so we could share. Everyone enjoyed their smoothie and the employees here were very friendly. \\n\\nI just wish these dang things were a little less pricey...and i would eat em more often, they are like having a meal.",
        "We were at the point in our Las Vegas vacation where we were sick of food and yet still hungry.  So we tried this place out and, yes ma'am, very good.  My husband had a waffle with frozen yogurt and I had the very berry crepes. Not expensive but not a cheap meal, either.  Good to people watch, great for somethin different in the Vegas experience which did not include the word 'buffet'.",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid.

Bizarre. Those of us who are born too long ago have to pay to get in now. Be sure to check the site before going.. Recent change.",
        "One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!",
        "This place is sweet. Complimentary valet, non smoking, need I say more?\\n\\nThe breakfast is and guest services is amazing, me an my new fiance have no complaints.\\nThe rates are great even during BIG weekends.\\n\\nWill return!",
        "I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also.",
        "I found this restaurant late at night, and it was really awesome. The chicken was amazing, but the potato balls with rice and sweet sauce were the best things I ate in Montreal.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "Iron-man for sure. Thanks Tony for an amazing job and dealing with a difficult customer. My husband finally found his Barber! Truly an amazing cut and experience. Great location and shop.  You rock in the Mohawk dept.",
        "Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \\\"three amigos\\\" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!",
        "Simply the best ramen in Scotland, chasu ramen all the way.",
        "The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere.",
        "Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service",
        "Wow, cougar city!  This must be where all divorcees end up going to find their next husbands.",
        "I was surprised to read the negative reviews here, I actually really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very nice, a couch, a refrigerator, nice bathroom couldn't ask for more. I have stayed at many hotels and wouldn't normally stay here but my brother is a regular gambler here and when I come with him this is where we always stayed. I love having the monorail right at the doorsteps, sure beats driving especially after a night out.",
        "The owner is there every day and he takes his food seriously. He loves for people to come in and it shows.  The burgers are just so good! Hot Juicy and Tasty. The milkshakes are to die for. My husband generally hates takeout, but even he loves this place. I highly recommend Lobby's Burgers.",
        "Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.",
        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "My wife and I have recently ate here twice in the same week. Love the atmosphere, Great food, prices are reasonable, happy hour is fun with great specials and decent discounts. Oh, the service was great as well!",
        "Meat delil lady today talked crap to her manager about me not knowing my wife was stand right there. So she went and found me to try and help after she relized. All I was asking for was her to cut my meat. I emailed corporate about her.",
        "I love this place!!! My husband and I claimed this to be our quick fix for dinner options!!",
        "If I could, I would give this place zero stars! The food was not bad but if you like to be treated rudely and enjoy crappy service then this is a place for you! Right when we were seated my husband wanted to get up and leave but we were in a large group so out of respect for everyone else who was hungry in our group we stayed.",
        "Received an email from the owner of the restaurant,  who states they are still open and it was a competitor across the street that closed. I don't live in Montreal so I can't confirm,  but my apologies to the proprietor. I wish I had found your restaurant as I was very much in the mood for sushi that night. Perhaps some better signage might be in order?",
        "Portions were huge!  We ate it all though.  That must have meant the food was tasty.  My wife and I shared one dish, The New Mexican Platter.  We also enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.",
        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",
        "Reallllly good sandwiches,  i love this place, just had a bad encounter with the owner one time though. Ive seen the guy on several occassions and he is nice,but this one time he basically borderline disrespected me....ugh I hate that because it has left with me with  a foul taste in my mouth for the place. HOWEVER --- I can't resist. I love this freaking place...",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "My wife and I really like this place. Its a casual atmosphere, friendly wait staff, good food. The manager is very knowledgeable about local beers and even made me a custom beer flight. They have a big selection of local draft beers. Wings are good, burgers excellent, good deserts. I've never had a bad meal here. I've only sat in the bar area. I've been 6 or 7 times and the service and food always consistently good.",
        "My husband and I needed new screens and batteries for our cell phones.  They were quick to fix the issues and we felt the prices were reasonable.   The store itself is a little hidden.  It's located upstairs in case anyone gets lost!",
        "Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.",
        "It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!",
        "Located next to C1, it's the perfect place to drink off that Vegas hangover while you wait for your flight. Not too expensive either - 9 dollar glass of wine is cheaper than I paid anywhere on the strip! I got some entertaining Vegas stories from the other patrons -- including one from a man whose traveling companion was too drunk to make it through security. Better than reading a copy of Us Weekly!",
        "The service is outstanding and the food is wonderful! My husband and I come here all the time.  The management and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The mardi gras roll is amazing!",
        "Stopped in for breakfast about 9:00 AM on a Monday.  It was not crowded.  The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP - tasty.  The noise level in this place was awful.  The music (50's music) was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers.  Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did.",
        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",
        "I go here every week with my husband and a group of friends.  I've noticed there are some negative reviews on here, and that came as a big surprise to me.  My husband and I have had Indian food in many different states and even different countries around the world.  After traveling around the world to find the perfect curry, I can tell you that this is the best.  I have not had better Indian food.  Truly.",
        "Great place to stop by and check out. My husband and I come here for produce and pine straw. Staff is always friendly. They usually have a large variety of produce. During Apple season I think they had about 15 different types to choose from.  \\n\\nHillybilly is Located at Margaret Wallace and Independence Blvd. This location can be difficult to get out of on Saturday and during rush hour because the right lane turns into a turning lane for Village Lake Drive.",
        "Excellent per-Valentine's Day dinner! The salmon I had was excellent and I liked their escargot. My fiance had the lamb. I normally do not enjoy the taste of lamb, but this dish was excellent. The atmosphere is really cute, really reminds me of the Provence. We did not have a chance to try the absinthe, but we'll be back...",
        "Entire experience was outstanding from spotting Don (husband of Vicky from the Real Housewives of the O.C) to my first time having brussel sprouts and Kobe NY strip,  the BF had Hangar Steak and for dessert we have a Jasmine Panna Cotta with Poney and Pears.\\n\\nI quite do not understand how there are vegetarians out there.  I love the smell and taste of beef!",
        "I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. \\n\\nThey are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me.",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "So I was excited to try a new place. I loved the country music but that is about all. After being seated at a very wet table I sat for almost 10 minutes and was never greeted by a waitress. Many walked by me, but no one stopped to say hello. So my husband and I left.  Will never be back. Sorry. I love to support my Chandler restaurants, but that was horrible service.",
        "This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!",
        "Even though I wasn't able to have  Gimme Some Sugar make my wedding cake I knew that I wanted to stop by their new bake shoppe while I was in Vegas. My husband and I were not disappointed. The opera cake is a must! I even picked up a few gifts for family while I was there and was told that the birthday cake macaroon was AMAZING!",
        "My wife and I went to the Waterfront tonight. Had a few drinks and appitisers. The coconut  shrimp is awesome. Has some great habanero seasoning with the salad side. It was a lot of fun sitting outside looking over the lake and having a beer. Very nice place, good food, good atmosphere, great staff.",
        "I really love Lumberjacks. My husband and I used to go every Monday as a day date. I can't believe it's the same place after reading the reviews. We've never had anything less than exemplary service with incredible food.The portions are huge and the service is fast.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "don't go here.\\nafter reading reviews, i went to it.\\ni and my friend ordered 2 pastas. they were horrible taste.\\nalfredo didn't have anything. only it and sauce.\\nif you are very hungry, i want to recoomend here.\\nthey serve huge amount of pastas",
        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",
        "Worst food terrible service and was forced to listen to the worst music ever created by a live singer hired to torture our ears\\nI could not wait to get out of here.\\n\\nIf there were negative stars for this review\\nIt would be warranted",
        "I'm in Sun City visiting my mom, and apparently this is a favorite of she and her husband. I'm absolutely stunned, as they usually have decent taste. Thus place was truly terrible.  The only redeeming quality was that it was relatively clean.",
        "My wife and I had breakfast here while staying at the Wigwam. The coffee was great. We both ordered omelets which were good sized and packed with ingredients. Very tasty and a good atmosphere.",
        "We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.  Happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with $3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps. My husband is a huge fan of the wings!",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",
        "Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.",
        "Recently had Tonya do a maternity shoot for my husband and I out at Lake Las Vegas. LOVED working with her. She had some great ideas and was very professional. Can't wait for her to do our newborn photos when our little guy decides to arrive!",
        "My husband really likes this place and I think they do a couple things really well-Chicken Parmigiana, Caesar salad and bread (an important part of an Italian meal experience). He gets the Veal Parmigiana or Clam Linguine and always enjoys it. The other things I have tried aren't to my liking, but I think this restaurant is worth a shot.",
        "Such a fun place. Bouncers are really friendly and even get in the show sometimes. Laid back atmosphere that's great for meeting up/chatting when the doors open. Once the show starts it gets loud. You can sit back and chill or get up and dance--whatever you prefer. Drink specials are pretty good (and usually strong!).  I am so sorry to hear this place is closing!!",
        "CC Sizzle on a sopapilla was awesome.  Like a super flavorful puffy taco.  The wife had the chicken tacos and mentioned the fresh tasting corn tortillas.  We also got a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa.  Everything was fantastic. \\n\\nAlso, the guy and lady working there were super nice and polite the whole time, major points for that.  I'll be returning.",
        "I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him.",
        "New to the vapor scene my wife and I ventured in to get some new supplies. The owner was very patient with us and took the time to explain every detail of the process And took apart the vaporizer and pieces it back together. You can sample the flavors before you buy. They give a punch card where every 10 bottles are free. Thanks for being so helpful and friendly!!",
        "No reason to waste a meal here if you're visiting Montreal for a few days. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good. The place was filled with tourists (myself included) and the service was understandably indifferent. Felt like a wasted 2 hours.",
        "Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!",
        "A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the full tasting menu with one wine pairing.\\n\\nThe dishes were very original and the presentation of each dish was extraordinary!\\n\\nEverything was beyond our expectation!\\n\\nBravo!",
        "Montreal is a great and vibrant city but PET Airport is cramped, dated, dark, and congested.  Its too bad that everyone gave up on Mirabel Airport.",
        "I am not sure if I went on an off day or what.  My omelet was less than mediocre.  My in-laws had sandwiches that came in regular sliced white sandwich bread, yuck! My husband had another omelet and he didn't finished his either.  My friend keeps asking me to go there with her, but I am too traumatized.",
        "It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well.",
        "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  We were ecstatic to hear of this opening as we were frequent diners at Postinos.  Everything we have ordered has been fabulous.  Their specialty cocktails are a perfect blend.  They always have different beer selection that is wonder.  Their service is top notch!  \\n\\nIf you are looking for some home cooking and great service give Windsor a try!",
        "This has to be the worst Mexican food I have ever had and the only reason I went was because my husband kept wanting to go here. He was as disappointed as I was. They charge for chips and salsa and it was really bad. They wont be here long and if they are it will be how they may cater to the college students.",
        "This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again.",
        "I was in the mood for a salad and looking at their menu I decided to go here. Nice place inside, very clean and decorated in blue and white. I ordered the Greek Salad with Gyro meat and no onions. I didn't get any of the olives either, bummer. My wife ordered a Pita with no onions and as she took a bite noticed onions. The service was decent, your average wait staff, pretty friendly",
        "Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "My wife and I had these hot dogs last night. Absolutely delicious!!!!! All toppings r free, n nicely presented for a 3.00 hot dog. Definitely a must for late night munchies"

        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.",
        "Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.",
        "It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!",
        "Napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes, the lobster and and soups are great, but the crab was bitter.",
        "Food just ok for me. I had a savory crepe with ham & cheese. Wasn't great. I'd like to go back & try a dessert crepe next time. Dim lighting, cool, calm & classy interior. great place for a date.",
        "Awesome AYCE sushi. They have egg custard which is my favorite. The only down side is its a little brown. But, still delicious. The sushi offered includes nigari and combo rolls. The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",
        "I felt like I was cheating on America's Dairyland.\\nNo Wisconsin cheese but hundreds, \\nHUNDREDS you guys from around the world!\\nAnd even though I'm lactose free I could appreciate the spectacular array of options and add-ons, quick things to grab for a lovely picnic or some charcute.",
        "Really gorgeous breakfast, everything looked good, but the pancakes were divine! Massive portions, but that's America! Taste was exceptional, one of the best places, for breakfast, I've ever eaten. The price was very good, about $40 for coffees and 2 lots of pancakes and that's including a generous, although normal, tip for America. Great atmosphere; quick and friendly service. Don't be put off by the queue; it moves quickly.",
        "The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.",
        "Not a place you can judge by its location or ambience - you just have to eat the food! Delicious and unique - not getting these dishes anywhere else in Madison. When we moved on to dessert, the chef brought us out 2 piping hot leaves filled with sticky, sweet rice (wish I knew the names of these dishes...) The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!",
        "2 stars for frozen hot chocolate... yummm\\nWaiting time to be seated 30 mins\\nWater to be delivered at your table 15 mins\\nAnother 15 mins wait to take your orders\\n41 minutes wait for the food :( \\nFood was so-so, not bad, not that good either.\\n\\nI only want the frozen hot choco, so I'll just order at the window next time.",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.",
        "Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one.",
        "1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",
        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",
        "This is convenient if you're staying at Delano, but its definitely not a place to trek to. \\n\\nI ordered a cheese panini and it was just okay. The sandwich was haphazardly put together. The bread was just decent and the cheese was just okay. The small side of tomato soup was good. \\n\\nThe fruit side had a chemical taste to it and I just couldn't eat most of it.",
        "This was literally the worse buffet food I have ever had and really has no place on the Vegas Strip. The food was bland, poorly presented and of medicore quality. The line layout is inefficient and confusing and the dessert table was like something at a gas stations snack area. Not even worth it when its free.",
        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",
        "Went for dessert & drinks.  Bar service was a slow & desserts were meh.  Did like the location & that the front walls opened to the street, but that isn't enough to get me to go back. Too many other great options around the area to settle for meh.",
        "We had a great experience! Such down to earth people who care about good food and service. I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak with a cup of creamy asparagus soup! Thank you Kristen for the great service!!!",

        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there.\\n\\nThe food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!\\n\\nOverpriced for the quality of food and service. \\n\\nI highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.",
        "This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!",
        "Called to make an appointment. Was asked what insurance I have and told her I didn't have insurance. She said Dr. Venkat wasn't currently taking cash patients. Wtf! Seems kinda rude.",
        "Pretty solid soup dumplings, and definitely worth the price, but I prefer the location on Lincoln.",
        "The side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing, but the sandwiches I've tried so far have been pretty bland.  I love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though.  It's a nice atmosphere",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Best hot and sour soup I've ever had!\\n\\nTake out! It's a hole in the wall. Family owned and ran, great people! I've been going here since a kid service and quality are consistent! Make sure you call in your order takes forever but that's how you know it's fresh!",
        "Came here a while back for a date night. We had backed escargots-delightful, lobster cocktail- just because its date night, onion soup-good, beefsteak tomato salad with anchovies-cant go wrong, the chateuabriand-finished at tableside, nice and tender. The accoutrements and ambiance are a reminiscent of vintage supper clubs. Its a special spot.",
        "Hamburgers and Onion Rings - the bomb.  They are good.  Service - can't say much for that.  First time, service was not good at all.  Second visit, service was better, but they messed up our orders.  Tortillas soup - 10.00 - very brothy, not much else in it.  Perfect place for burgers and onion rings.",
        "Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however.",
        "28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word \\\"Express\\\" from your signage.",
        "I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and have wanted to eat at one of his restaurants forever. Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait! We had his famous beef wellington, which was to die for! The atmosphere was awesome, servers and waiters were incredibly nice and informative. I can't wait to go back!",
        "GREAT FOOD . . . slow service (hence only four stars). We loved the atmosphere and the menu was small but complete. A pork, beef, vegetarian, seafood, poultry choice for main entrees. The beet salad was amazing--very different from anything I have ever had. We also had salmon, duck, and halibut. Everyone was happy. The dessert sampler at the end of the meal is perfect!",
        "Yummy veggie noodle soup... Veggie spring rolls and shrimp rolls are delicious... Lightly fried... Glad my family enjoyed it and they say that Vegas doesn't have good thai food..",
        "Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again.",
        "For $35/person but no olysters or sahimi?  No way!  It's just not worth it.  I dont understand why it's rated four stars.  If you put aside the dessert, it's a $15 buffet top.   For same price, I'd rather go to Todai at Planet Hollywood.",
        "Alway a very good lunch...make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal!  Opa!",
        "Decent thickness and nice roast of chashu. Spicy misco doesn't go over the good taste of soup but I would still prefer the original. I will not order Gyoza next time because I am  going to save space for the ramen.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "Friendly service!  The quiche and granola pancakes are both delicious!  The lattes are huge.  I've also had the Peter Wrappit, which was very good.  We generally go to Manna for brunch.  I'd say it's one of our favorites in Madison!\\n\\nThe dinner service is really nice.  It has a really different vibe than the breakfast atmosphere.  They accept Bicycle Benefits!",
        "At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food.",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",
        "Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.",
        "The price was \\\"ok\\\" and a bit high but I have to say that their food portions were large. I got pho with everything in it and as a vietnamese person who eats pho regularly, this was not all that great. There was hardly meat, just mostly ramen and soup. The flavor wasn't entirely there, at least not what I am use to. Save your money and head over to Saigon for some good pho for the right price on Alma school.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "I love this restaurant, I've been eating here for years (when it was still at Barbary) and not only is the food great but service is like none other!  Get the dover sole if you like fish and lamb if you like meat.  Delicious onion soup and salads are made tableside.  Its pricey but well, well worth it.",
        "There are better car insurance companies.  I had Geico for a long time, but when you need them, they don't care about you at all.  Too big a company, and uncaring.",
        "I introduced this joint to my five companions on my most recent trip to Sin City and they immediately made it their dining choice every night (i should say morning..) for the remainder of the trip.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong coming to this place, unless you try to eat at around 7pm. In that case, expect a 75min wait for the best value restaurant in the county.",
        "Amazing food- each plate we shared was phenomenal and unique. The white onion soup was honestly one of the best soups I have ever had- sweet and savory, rich and light all at once. The chayote with rock shrimp was also fantastic. To top off all the great food, when they heard it was my birthday they brought out a cute happy birthday plate with 2 cake pops and fruit (complimentary). A very nice touch!",
        "Really good soups.\\nGreat place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time",
        "Very friendly staff. Food is cheap like any fast-food chinese restaraunt. The portions are huge for the lunch and dinner specials. The veggies are fresh just the right crunch. The food is better than the more expensive chinese restaraunts. Dissapointed with the egg rolls and the soups though. They can use some improvement but overall a quick and easy decision.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Female server lacked personality, didn't check on me except to bring me my food or water, and gave me my bill without even suggesting dessert. Cook forgot to make an item I ordered, and she didn't even notice!\\n\\nLIKE  The curry. The loco moco. The different sides and toppings. The desserts.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "Rookie place. If you don't care about decor go to US Egg around the corner. Better service, food and coffee. Bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress.",
        "Paid for a venti green tea lemonade and got a tall green tea lemonade . Reason why I didn't go back was because I had to go to school was in a rush I wish the girls that always take my orders were there",
        "Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.",
        "Terrible. Tried the bulgogi sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a mocha frap - none of it was good and it was as expensive as the awesome deli dinner I has the night before.",
        "I love the bread pudding and the soup.  But the prices are high, not open on Sunday, and I was not impressed with the breakfast.",
        "I'm writing this at the bar at BRI. I just finished the stacked enchilada. So very good!! It was pretty spicy but not in an overwhelming way. Super tasty!! \\n\\nThe other night I had the Spanglish sandwich. That was another huge winner!! \\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty good too!\\n\\nYou should check this spot out!",
        "M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.",
        "Entire experience was outstanding from spotting Don (husband of Vicky from the Real Housewives of the O.C) to my first time having brussel sprouts and Kobe NY strip,  the BF had Hangar Steak and for dessert we have a Jasmine Panna Cotta with Poney and Pears.\\n\\nI quite do not understand how there are vegetarians out there.  I love the smell and taste of beef!",
        "Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I.",
        "Terrible service, terrible food quality and horrifying prices!  Seriously folks you can eat at PF Changs and have far better food, service and pay 1/3 of the cost!  Truly the worst Hot & Sour Soup and Mongolian Beef I have ever tasted, in fact I could only eat a tiny portion of each.  Steve Wynn should be ashamed of himself!",
        "The chicken snitchel was the best! We got a combo to try weiner chicken and pork chop ...next time I will get just the chicken snitchel as the flavors were amazing!! We also started with the beef vegetable soup...took me back to my youth in England. Very authentic. The service and atmosphere was great too!",
        "Had a nice breakfast, I tried the Mexican Omelette and it was very good. I recommend getting the salsa on the side as my omelette had a lot of salsa on it. They had fresh squeezed lemonade which was really good as well. If you need to get some breakfast this place was great since it's in a nice location.",
        "Get some late night dessert here and receive free entry to the club. The desserts here are so pretty, that you'll have to take a picture before you take a bite. Too bad the dessert doesn't make up for the lame club there have here afterwards. The music is wack and I just can't dance to wack music.",
        "Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday.",
        "Pretty solid Korean food imo. Ordered the Gamjatang (meat was tender, broth was flavourful) and bibimbap (this also came with a soup which was nice!).\\n\\nWould recommend this place for a good Korean meal in Waterloo :)",
        "Yummy, quick lunch! This is our go-to local Chinese restaurant. It has been consistently good over the past 4-5 years we have been living here. We especially like their luncheon specials and to go dinners. We love their mu shu chicken/pork and their wonton soup.",
        "Stopped at this vintage A&W restaurant on the way back from Las Vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat.  We both had the classic rootbeer float.  It was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child.  Only used the drive-through so cannot comment on anything else.",
        "Nice place for a brunch. A bit expensive though and no pancakes!",
        "Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \\n\\nThe bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu.",
        "yummaaaaaaay....open till midnight! Chill outside on the patio at night, or during the day if its not 110 degrees. Fresh veggies, tasty blue cheese dip. Weird baked beans, more like baked bean soup. They tell everyone 18 minutes for the order to be ready. You may want to call ahead if your impatient.",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "Went here at 1am on Black Friday. The place is pretty ghetto for being inside a casino.\\n\\nOxtail Soup was the only thing worth trying. Ordered the fish and chips and it was still cold on the inside. Also tried the steak and it was pretty bland. One trick pony in my opinion.",
        "The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The salsa tasted like spicy tomato soup, the tortillas were hard, but I had a veggie fajita and they brought out beef, I am vegan so had to ask for just veggies but when the veggies came out they were good lots of variety, broccoli, squash, zucchini, and mushrooms.",
        "Have been here several times and so far, only one dish was OK: the pasta dish under Health Conscious. All the other dishes have been disappointing, including the Fruit Crepes which I had today, the omelette which was overcooked, the pancakes which have been tasteless. For breakfast, I would be better off going to IHOP.",
        "Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.",
        "It's a very close distance to ny my hotel where we were staying. the prices are great. They have gluten free pancakes which is awesome. The food is really good compare to its price range. Nothing fancy but practically good.",
        "If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  \\n\\nAnother great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior.",
        "I frequent Spokes about once a week with a group of friends. The place is great. Food is tasty. Staff is friendly. My only complaint is about the water. The water is terrible. It has a dirty taste to it. Their tea and lemonade also tastes that way. Everything else is good here.",
        "I got the Kyawe Soup which is a rice noodle soup. Really tasty and reminds me of food I get at home. My friend got the Kyar San Hingar which is a similar noodle soup and just as good. Didn't try the sushi, but my friend got the 16 piece and they gave him 20. Owners were really nice.",
        "I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good.  So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood.",
        "The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \\\"krab\\\", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.",
        "I ordered a chophouse burger for dinner this evening along with the bottomless root beer float. We hadn't been to Red Robin in quite sometime mainly owing to having outrageously busy work schedules. The burger was excellent but I drank too many floats before it arrived. It was nice to receive a red royalty discount of 10% off the bill.\\n(4/7/13)",
        "Yelp and Good Fellas  really came through for my family and I while we were off the beaten path looking for some good grub.  Good Fellas is very very good food.  They have a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is just about the food.  Try the two meat combo.  MMMMMM!  The lentil soup is excellant (try it with some lemon juice).  The only thing I did not like about the place is it is not in the east valley!",
        "Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.",
        "We come here often! The food is excellent and fresh. We have great service and enjoy the ambiance. They have delicious salsa and you can ask for one a bit hotter and wow it's great! They also have great lemonade!!\\n\\nDuring the week they have very reasonable lunch specials!",
        "Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better."

For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",

        "AC just died on Sunday and after looking at Yelp I found these guys with glowing reviews. I see why. They were consistant on what time they would be there and they diagnosed the issue quickly. They were informative and friendly. That is a great way to recieve repeat business. Hope the AC doesnt fail anymore this summer but if it does Im calling the Flores'",
        "Fried chicken salad was really good. Good service. Only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth. I said no, a table. Arrived on time and it was packed...and they had saved us a booth.  Kind of pricey, though, unless you get the happy-hour specials. And there were families with kids in there; little kids, so it's ok to bring your family.",
        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "We stayed here for a couple of nights.  Since it was the middle of the week, we had a sweet deal.  Thankfully we were in a floor that was fairly quiet, as well as being well off from the elevators.  The room was nice and clean, albeit starting to show a little wear and tear.  Staff was really nice and our kids loved swimming in nearly all of the pools.  Would definitely stay here again.  It was a really nice way to start off our vacation.",
        "Have only had 1 massage here.  It was ok; felt more like a sports massage (with stretching involved) than a relaxing one.  I prefer the atmosphere and massage techniques at Dolce.  I do frequent this place for brow waxing, even though they did burn me once.  Cute place though.",
        "poor in room Quality, but Close in Atmosphere.  The Hotel seemed more personal, not too extreme.  staff is friendly.  The gift Shop sales Liquor and I won $500 one night and $1600 the next on the same machine.",
        "I introduced this joint to my five companions on my most recent trip to Sin City and they immediately made it their dining choice every night (i should say morning..) for the remainder of the trip.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong coming to this place, unless you try to eat at around 7pm. In that case, expect a 75min wait for the best value restaurant in the county.",
        "I never thought much of this place but tried it again recently and it was alright.  Nice that they have Old Meck on tap, the beer is bitchin.  I had their chili cheese fries and they were a fail.  It was like that liquid cheese like the jar stuff by frito lay.  The chili was like real chili and made the fries slimey and wet.  I had wings as the main course and they were good, no complaints with them.",
        "Went looking for a Sonoran Dog and heard this place had a Phoenix Dog that was close to a Sonoran Dog. It was further then I use go for food but closest place with a Sonoran Dog. It was YUMMY!!! So were the onion rings. Not over priced either. The hot dogs are all beef and deep fried. Very clean and nice services.",
        "Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  \\nHad to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever.",
        "Tried to eat lunch here today.  Was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up.  Waited for a half hour with no service.  Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training.",
        "We ordered an egg free cake for a birthday. The cake is delivered on time. That is my first star. Other than that, nothing is worth mentioning. The cake is hard as hell and the sweetness is not up to the mark. The texture is too hard to cut through. I had number of egg free cakes before this, but this is not even close. Never again am I going to give this a chance and I don't recommend this to anybody else.",
        "I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!",

        "This place is so outdated... the rooms are for those who just want to have a place to crash... maybe with a group of friends on a whim trip! The location is nice for going places on the strip but this hotel is in need of major repair!",
        "Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.",

        "I like to stop in here now and again since its so close to home. Good service and a really fun selection of gelato. Shares the building with coffee shop Hava Java next door. Nice private outdoor, shaded, seating as well. Good overall, but three stars for an previous issue with some spoiled gelato.",
        "I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.\\n\\nPoor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.",
        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",

        "You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing.",
        "The sandwich filling options are good, but the bread is dry, crumbly, and tastes mass produced. With options like milio's and Jimmy john's so close by with much better bread, it's hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here.",
        "A very nice sports bar.  Great place to watch a game or just hang out.  They have awesome TV's.  My boyfriend is in love with their nachos because they use fresh jalapenos, which makes them pretty spicy.  I'm very excited to have such a nice sports bar so close to home.",

        "We really enjoyed our meal here.  Food was delicious and fresh and RAPIDLY PREPARED.  Very nice ambiance; well-decorated and comfortable.  Equally as good as the other Pho restaurants we've frequented here in the valley - and the price is right.  $24 for 2 people, no drinks, ate until we were full.  We will definitely be back!",

And the soothing music.",
        "Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one.

        "It's a PITA to get in if you're with all guys as they allow only 1:1 male:female ratio. This is great because women outnumber the guys, and there is nothing worse than going into a club and being surrounded by guys (unless that's your thing). It get extremely crowded even though there are 3 different areas of the club. Tao Beach has a great view. Overall a decent Vegas club.",

        "This place visually is nice, as far as the attitude of staff and service don't expect too much unless you are the money mogul type. This place is ran by old school people that still lives in the 1930's.

It seemed a little out of date to me, and the people that were here didn't speak English and let their children run around barefoot while screaming.

I am 100% sure it's this place because it's the only thing I had eaten all day - I'm here for CES. I got the Ruben and I thought something was weird about the sauce but attributed it to shitty Vegas food. Going on 12 hours sick. :(",

The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ).",
        "Before I finally tried this place, a couple people told me this was the best noodles in Vegas. I has the T. Shoyu noodles & Takana fried rice.

These are only my opinions, perhaps many others think Monta is one of the best as well.",

        "Located within treasure island. It's an odd combo a pho shop and coffee shop. I only ordered a Cobb salad $15 and service seemed good, unlike other reviews.  The salad was decent and serving size was large. We spilt the salad between two people  and it was enough food.  I can't speak for the pho, but the bowls seemed large and people around me seemed to be enjoying them.",
        "Yum! I enjoyed a basic New York pepperoni pie and they definitely did it justice. Loved the crust and the sauce. Also tried the house sangria, a bit sweet for me but it was just about right after adding some freshly-squeezed lemon juice.

        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Pretty good... Not as good as \\\"Wahoos\\\" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.",
        "Luiz did a great job!  I was impressed that he called me back within a few minutes of my initial call and was able to schedule me within 24 hours time. He also provided a reasonable quote over the phone and did not try to upsell.  I asked for additional services when he arrived and he provided a fair price for the additional area. My carpets smell fresh and look like new. I definitely would recommend Luiz's company to anyone looking for an honest and thorough service.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)",
        "This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.",
        "Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors.\\nDinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size.\\nSave room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce.",
        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me.",
        "My previous review was very harsh, but true.  I met some friends at the roosevelt last week and the service was perfect.  I have had nothing but poor service previously, but this new hipster guy that waited on us was a really great waiter.  So, I'm upping the stars, hopefully the service keeps improving.",
        "Friendly staff and great options for sauce. But quality of food of comparable to cafeteria food. Feel like Im eating at high school again.",

        "Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  \\nHad to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever.",
        "Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED...

        "Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!",

        "Seriously, no idea how anyone could give a good review for this awful restaurant. Agreed on the nice setting. But the food is terrible. And really overpriced! It's always empty...for good reason. I make better fajitas than this place (and so does TGIF) but they charge $22 for them...and sour cream is extra. Food cannot be less authentic. No clue about Mexican food at all. Save yourself the bother.",
        "Food is good but make sure to ask for easy sauce. All their dishes come with globs of sauce that is at the bottom of the bowl. There is no other rice bowl places is this area besides YC's. Gave 3 star because like YC's better and food comes with too much sauce. Will return but won't venture far into their menu besides ordering the teriyaki chicken bowl.",
        "Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.",
        "We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.",

        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",
        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",
        "Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.",
        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "I'm guessing Paul McCartney was singing about Lookout Mountain when he serenaded us with, \\\"the long and winding road, that leads me to your summit\\\".  Well, it seems that The Walrus had a flair for exaggeration.  While the path was truly winding, it really wasn't that long.\\n\\nTotal time up and back was 29:18.  Pretty easy hike.  This was my first of four mountains, one Saturday in April.",
        "the chicken shwarma sandwich was pretty good, but not the best i've had.  the sandwich was dripping with grease, which might freak other people out, but i'm ok with it.  the potatoes with the garlic cream sauce is off the chain though!",
        "As a resident of South Scottsdale, this is a true gem.  The food is fresh and crazy good.  They are creative and farm to table I believe is truly what they are.  The cocktail program is spot on if you want to enjoy true craft spirits.  The service is 5 star and you never get disappointed.",
        "Absolutely enjoyed the dinner I had here.   Service was excellent and I have some very good memories from the dinner here.  A true pleasure and enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",

Sandwich's as big as your head, with tons of different stuff on them...\\n\\nAwesome beer selection, great atmosphere...\\n\\nThis place + some friends= one of the best times you ever had!\\n\\nFYI: they are pretty cool about you doing whatever you want to a headwich...more sauce, add this, extra that, :)",
        "nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.",
        "So after the billet bar finally closed Bar 350 popped up and I hoped they would get away from the wannabe biker bar that billet was and the wannabe crowd that always hung out there.  Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.",
        "Forget the tablecloth-and-white-glove joints. I walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu, but was even more impressed with the healthy options available. I had an omelet and wheat toast, and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm - and I'm not a small guy.",
        "Stopped at this vintage A&W restaurant on the way back from Las Vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat.  We both had the classic rootbeer float.  It was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child.  Only used the drive-through so cannot comment on anything else.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",

        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \\n\\nThe bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu.",
        "Waited 10 min at airport for shuttle to arrive.  Waited 15 min to load the bus in a leisurely and surly fashion.  Waited 10 min after bus was full, not sure why.  What would have been an 8 min taxi  ride took over an hour with all the stops.  And we only saved $5 for the two of us compared to a taxi.  Just say no to Slowtime.",
        "My third timing coming. I really want to work with them because there's not much Chinese in Phoenix and the staff is super nice; however, the sauce is horrible! More so, it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring, blabs way too sweet sauce. I will not be back.",
        "Came here once and wasn't too sure if I wanted to return. Food was okay, just had better. I had the bun riue and it had real crab but it was missing something. I added more fish sauce but it didn't have the taste I was used too. We had the spring rolls wasn't all.that great.",
        "yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too.",

Also, this Starbucks is generally open until 10:00 pm. It is the Starbucks open the latest that is not built into another store or casino.",
        "I was the only customer, service good, the spaghetti sauce must of been out of a can plane as could be. Meatballs hard no taste. The Italian combo sub was like eating the sole of a shoe. The appetizer tomato.and garlic toast was very good. The atmosphere was nice. For $31 left very very DISAPPOINTED will NEVER GO BACK. I hope the owner reads this.",
        "If you want to be ignored, listen to your bartenders complain about their lives, enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers, and have that true crap Southside experience, this is the place to be.",
        "I went here with 2 of my friends. It is clean and service was good but the food was disgusting. We all got different dishes and none of liked it. My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce. Would not recommend this place if you have taste buds.",
        "I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good.  So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood.",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "We use to love this place, but the food - value ratio is on the decline. We had the thin crust pizza and it tasted like crackers with red sauce. We enjoy the live music and warm tea on the patio at sunset, but it has changes so much. I am not sure if we will give it another try, very disappointed.",
        "The waiter was amazing, and so was the food. The ambiance is really nice. Very fun and loud. VERY casual. Don't wear anything nice, you WILL smell like their sauces. The food was really great and super interactive. I don't suggest the shrimp, they're not that great. King crab still has my mouth drooling.",
        "Great customer service by knowledgable, friendly staff. Not true cheapest place in town but you get what you pay for. Highly quality tint and great service. Worth every penny, money well spent. I highly recommend them.",

My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",

Came with fries and a drink. \\nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \\nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \\nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome.",

The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",
        "Ordered chicken fingers and fries on special for $5.95. The chicken fingers were the kind of chicken you find in a $1 McDonald's chicken sandwich. The fries were completely tasteless. No salt. For the price, Jack in the Box or Farm Basket is much much better. Will not eat here again.",

        "This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",

        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. \\nHad the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. \\nService was attentive and friendly - no issues. \\nWill eat here again.",
        "Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "The BBQ is decent, depending on what you get (the brisket is meh, the chicken is pretty good, the ribs are decent).  The Saturday college football viewing is nice.  The service is friendly, even when your kids are making a huge mess.  It's definitely going in the Saturday afternoon rotation.",

The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",
        "I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!",

        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger.\\nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips.\\nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt.\\n\\nThis was worth trying once.",

Only cash or debit card.",
        "The place looked good from the outside. Yet, as I ordered one of their burgers, I was disappointed. The beef patty was very thin and soggy. The fries were, in addition to sharing the sogginess of the burger, a tad cold. The place was packed though--so, it must have been one of those orders that did not hit the mark. I am not sure I would go back.",
        "For the fans of Bueno Burger it's no bueno because the lights have been turned off at this location. I was going to do lunch on New Year's Day and there was a For Lease sign. It's a shame, the lady who ran this place was so accomodating. She let me crash there while waiting for AAA after I pulled into the adjacent parking lot with a flat tire a couple of months ago.",
        "Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.",
        "Food was pretty good. Nothing too unique or memorable besides the decor, and the 60s music absolutely killed the mood. They need to keep with the theme and have instrumental chill music. Ciabatta chicken sandwich was ok. Bread lacked the traditional ciabatta flavor. Sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. Hummus was pretty good, though the pita tasted a bit raw?",
        "Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.",
        "Ehhhhhhh.\\nOverhyped in my opinion. I've tried it a couple of times at a couple of different locations but came away with the same impression: burgers - nothing special, good but not great; shakes - same; fries - meh.\\nI'll give it another shot the next time I'm in Scottsdale and try to remember to order off the \\\"secret\\\" menu. Maybe that's where the really good stuff is.",

        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service",
        "This is your typical greasy spoon place. A run down resto that has amazing hot dogs, fries and poutine. Not a classy place but a great spot for a quick bite.",
        "We love going to the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay.  You build your own burger.  Pick your bun, meat, toppings and condiments.  I usually get the Angus beef with pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup and mustard on a wheat bun.  Our favorites are: skinny fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, the sliders and the chocolate or vanilla milkshakes - oh my!",
        "Fried chicken salad was really good. Good service. Only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth. I said no, a table. Arrived on time and it was packed...and they had saved us a booth.  Kind of pricey, though, unless you get the happy-hour specials. And there were families with kids in there; little kids, so it's ok to bring your family.",
        "Front staff annoyed me. They have about 3 girls they look like they're 16 or 17. Have no customer service skills or communication skills. I asked her a simple question about the open bar she had no fucking idea how to answer my question. Security guard total asshole. Not to mention they only accept cash.",
        "WARNING !!!  this location is worse than any used car lot I ever visited.  Had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me.  Good therapists and good massage but HoRRiBLE business ethics,  DO NOT give them your credit card or checking info",
        "Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again.",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "There are better car insurance companies.  I had Geico for a long time, but when you need them, they don't care about you at all.  Too big a company, and uncaring.",
        "I never thought much of this place but tried it again recently and it was alright.  Nice that they have Old Meck on tap, the beer is bitchin.  I had their chili cheese fries and they were a fail.  It was like that liquid cheese like the jar stuff by frito lay.  The chili was like real chili and made the fries slimey and wet.  I had wings as the main course and they were good, no complaints with them.",
        "Doesn't quite have the spirit of camaraderie  of an actual pub house but hey this is Scottsdale and ideas of brotherhood are easily snuffed out by skinny jeans and tawdry gossip.  \\nI recommend that you go on a quiet night so you can enjoy this place uninterrupted.  The menu has all the standards but with an improved twist.  I have a hard time leaving the Squealer Burger and fries but the whole menu is a welcome joy.",
        "Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \\\"chicken\\\" tacos.",
        "not worth going to. go to the south rim its better because u can take pictures there as well as free shuttle buses and a theatre. you have to pay to get in on the west rim as well as not bringing no phones no camera. what is the use of paying $74 a person to go on the skywalk and then not using your camera to take photos that is a rip off. everyone comes miles and miles away to come here to take photos.",
        "I truly love golds. Clean facility , friendly staff, and my favorite part : the cardio cinema ! Not to mention the wonderful personal trainers, namely Jamie. She is always friendly and motivating. I've learned so many great work outs that I can easily replicate at home. The prices are reasonable as well.",
        "We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again.",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Located next to C1, it's the perfect place to drink off that Vegas hangover while you wait for your flight. Not too expensive either - 9 dollar glass of wine is cheaper than I paid anywhere on the strip! I got some entertaining Vegas stories from the other patrons -- including one from a man whose traveling companion was too drunk to make it through security. Better than reading a copy of Us Weekly!",
        "Food was ok, maybe a step up from dennys with a nice selection. I do have to give props for the service though. The server was excellent and the manager, who I overheard talking to the couple in the booth next to us, was bending over backwards to make them happy so the place really seems to want to make their customers happy. So in a nutshell ok food with good service at decent prices. Can't recommend but I might give them a second shot.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "I went here with my girlfriend and neither of us were impressed with the food. She had the brisket sandwich which completely lacked any sort of flavor along with corn on the cob which was soggy and inedible. As for me I had the baby back ribs which were OK but far from great. I would not recommend this place to any friend and will certainly not be coming back.",
        "I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the chili cheese fries. Otherwise, my burger was dry and seemed to be one of those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. Gross. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was dry and not enough sauce. Not to mention that the service was sad. Will never return, even if I was staying at the Flamingo.",
        "Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.",
        "Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! \\n. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's.",
        "Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.",
        "Beware of this place.  If you give them a credit card they will charge $25 on it no matter what even if you paid cash.  It happened to us a few nights ago.  We called the bar and they said it's their standard practice to charge this and then sometime later in the week to refund it.  Total BS we paid in cash there should be no charge on my card period.  We will never go back.",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.",
        "Kimberly the waitress was nice and helpful when ordering as for the differences in ribs.  As for the ribs I ordered spare ribs and the baby back ribs both were good. For the sides I got fries, onion rings, potato salad, and coleslaw nothing great.  Definitely would go back again",
        "Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!",
        "I thank God i got the tickets for free. Otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in Vegas. The women were hott, but the overall performance was really bad. They tried to mix in comedy and singing as well. Just horrible show. I did see only three couples walk out.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "Not much to say other then you better have money if you think you're going to shop here. They have a couple restraints I look forward to trying but will never come back to shop. Watch out for the security. They were following me everywhere like I was a criminal. I assume it was because I was wearing sweats.",
        "This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .",
        "This was a great burger experience. I had he bbq bacon burger and smash fries. I called in the order and ate most of the fries on my 10 minute ride home because I was afraid that thy would be nasty cold. I was wrong! My fiance had the sweet potato fries. They were still yummy once we got them home. I have driven by this place many times and will be back soon!",
        "Great rooms but that's all. First we have been moved to another room the second night ruining our morning. Barbara at the front desk was rude and unhelpful and made us get crazy to solve a problem they caused! They also messed with our players card and we never saw coffee and newspapers included in the suite price! A beautiful setting ruined by the attitude of the employees.. Will never book it again!",
        "Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,",
        "The egg pizza is the bomb!!  Also, awesome garlic fries and a great chopped salad.  Everyone we recommended the egg pizza to loved it!!",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",
        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "Was a great hotel and love the fact that I got 40% off my KA tickets. But when it comes to the small things it sucks. Like no free wireless Internet, no fridge, and no microwave. But I still had a great time.",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "Way to much salt on everything and I like salt but this was over the top. I was looking forward the the veggie fries but I couldn't eat more than a few. The chicken was fatty, really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt.\\nMy friend raves about the burgers so maybe that's the way to go....\\n\\n\\nHonest to god I wouldn't eat here again for free. Gross.",
        "Good food great old school hip hop high ass prices....definitely different items ..like ox tail fries,  different.",
        "Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "Elements is a gift shop in Aria that sells cigarettes , snacks and some interesting , random gifts and suveniors . They had blackjack strategy cards for $2 which was kinda random but nice . The snacks and beverages at this store might be kind of overpriced just like everything else in Vegas but the great thing about this store is that they're open 24 hours .",
        "Awesome! Five guys....Mmmmmm! That's all I got to say...love the fries..talk about canon style.",
        "Last night was my first time there the fries were recooked with a bottle of salt and the veggie burger fell apart....35 dollars later for two no thank you my last time",
        "Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",
        "I order the number two combo which is the combination burrito fries and a coke. The French fries at Del Taco are always good. the combination burrito was very small and bland. the first half of the burrito was all beans and the second half of the burrito was all meat. The place looked fairly clean and the workers seemed nice. I'm here for the food please lets get it right.",
        "Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.",
        "Worth everything you pay here.  I used to drive about 7 miles for Pho, but now I come here, less than a mile away for my fix.  I love to order the beef special with rare beef, brisket, and beef balls to go.  Their broth is really clear.  Their egg rolls are really good as well.  Worth the try if you live in the area!",
        "I went here for breakfast daily when I was on vacation because of the reasonable prices so that I was able to do some damage at the steakhouses at night!\\n\\nDon't forget to get your patronage card stamped because after a certain amount I think you get a free one.\\n\\nThe service was good and the food was Ok but its really hard to mess up breakfast."

        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now.",
        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",
        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "Probably one of the best steaks in Las Vegas. Comfortable seating and busy. Very busy. Lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little, but delicious amount you got. For a new restuarant the staff was very well trained. Looking forward to next visit, minus lobster app.",
        "Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken.",
        "Their beer sampler is fun way to sample their good beers and have fun at the same time. I thought their fish fry was really good, too.\\n\\nIf you're going to dine there during warm month, try the pretty outside garden seating and make sure to share appetizer with friends for start of a nice evening to ensue.",
        "Ate here before seeing Terry Fator. This is my first time eating at this chain. I was NOT impressed. Freschetta FROZEN pizza tasted better than this place. The prices were ridiculous. For the same price I would rather go to Settebello's. They are the BEST pizza in town! Save your money and forgo California Pizza Kitchen.",
        "This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes.",
        "Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.",
        "This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious. \\n\\nThey don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!",
        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",
        "Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.",
        "Typical college restaurant. Food was mediocre for me but a good choice for college kids.  Had the pizza and the artichoke dip.  It was recommended at not that good.",

        "I have been a big fan of this restaurant until this evening.  I had loved the fish and chips, but tonight the portion was measly and the chips were frozen fries instead of the waffle ones.  For the price, which I use to not mind because the food was exceptional was a rip off. Kids pizza was down right nasty.  Unfortunately, this neighborhood gem has turned into a huge disappointment.",
        "Way too crowded for it's small size. Have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies. The only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in. The place looks nice but I'm not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me.",
        "Hurray for happy hour! 98 South has an awesome happy hour and you should totally go.\\n\\nGet a dirty martini, red red wine and half price appetizers. Usually on Monday nights they have an awesome couple playing jazz. They're really cool man.\\n\\nCheers.",
        "We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",
        "We are in Vegas on vacation and we always enjoy finding the local places to eat that you just can't find anywhere else. Yayo Taco was excellent!!! I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything from the menu; the Pollo, the Camarones, the Texano and the Shanghi tacos were incredible!!! You gotta go...",

        "This was literally the worse buffet food I have ever had and really has no place on the Vegas Strip. The food was bland, poorly presented and of medicore quality. The line layout is inefficient and confusing and the dessert table was like something at a gas stations snack area. Not even worth it when its free.",
        "We were at the point in our Las Vegas vacation where we were sick of food and yet still hungry.  So we tried this place out and, yes ma'am, very good.  My husband had a waffle with frozen yogurt and I had the very berry crepes. Not expensive but not a cheap meal, either.  Good to people watch, great for somethin different in the Vegas experience which did not include the word 'buffet'.",
        "The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house.",
        "You will find no other bruschetta place with such diverse menu and ever-changing wine list, which consistently exceeds expectations.",
        "Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive).",
        "The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25",
        "I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "As always, the peril cornbread appetizer is a delicious meal.  Unless you  have a big appetite..you will be pleasantly full from this one dish.  The chile rellenos is awesomely different.  \\n Located in downtown Phoenix, it is fun to sit outside and peoplewatch.",
        "Super slow service, mediocre to poor food..I'd check out other IHOP's in the area....not worth your time.",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",
        "Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price.",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "Un service chaleureux, un couscous g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reux, des dattes aux amendes savoureuses pour accompagner un excellent th\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la menthe. Le coin berb\\u00e8re est un must!",
        "Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!!  Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had!  I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!",
        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",
        "Amazing food from beginning to end. Don't miss the quinoa stuffed avocado. The Classic Saltado is scrumptious! Great kids menu too :)",
        "Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.",
        "Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place.  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon.  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices.  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich!!  Yikes.  We will not return.",
        "This place makes me want to put my dick in a panenni press....how hard is it to toast a bagel and stir a coffee??? Jeeze, everyone who is involved with the drive thru is hard of hearing and are constantly fucking up orders and screaming their names through the speaker, Donna, relax girl. I don't give a fuck what your name is just make my coffee and shit right....",
        "I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame. \\n\\nI could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!",
        "Have been for late dinner, and happy hour appetizers.  Both good, but only good.  Which is good!!  Italian is top quality for Las Vegas, but with a club inside the restaurant it becomes tough to take serious as a top quality restaurant.  The appetizers are great, cocktails are decent. If you want Vegas flare, it is one of the top places that cater to people who need both liquid and solid.  Definitely worthy!",
        "Love this place. The bruschetta is awesome",
        "Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors.\\nDinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size.\\nSave room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce.",
        "My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",
        "I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",
        "the \\\"grilled\\\" vegetables were limp and steam-cooked. the vegetarian fajitas had bits of shredded chicken in them. the rice was this weird rice-a-roni take-off on \\\"spanish\\\" rice. yuck. maybe the meat dishes are decent, but the vegetarian dishes were at best mediocre. i can cook better stuff at home.",
        "Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.",
        "Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive).",
        "I went here only because we had a 90% off Restaurant.com Coupon and I'm glad I didn't actually pay full price. The food was so mediocre that I determined that they don't put much effort into the food because they assume that the people eating here are already so wasted that they won't notice. Not a fan...",
        "Disappointed because I wanted to send a gift to my Mother and Grandmother for Mother's Day.  Tried to order two gift tins of Medjool Dates on the website but unfortunately the website was not functioning properly.  No big deal, I will give them a call, which I did....  During business hours, but got an answering machine.  Left a message that I wanted to place an order.  Nobody returned the call.  I guess they already have all the business they need.",
        "This place is horrible! \\n\\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?",
        "Great sandwiches and great service.  But what's with the no restroom policy?  Isn't it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom?  The hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isn't cutting it folks.",
        "Oh No!!!! \\nTo begin with twist cap wine-really??\\nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much.\\nWould not go here again......bye bye bob\\nFor that price go to charcoal room",
        "Reallllly good sandwiches,  i love this place, just had a bad encounter with the owner one time though. Ive seen the guy on several occassions and he is nice,but this one time he basically borderline disrespected me....ugh I hate that because it has left with me with  a foul taste in my mouth for the place. HOWEVER --- I can't resist. I love this freaking place...",
        "Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead.",
        "Amazing little place!  So many sodas and root beers!  Love it must go and eat waffle sandwich. Mmmmm!",
        "Everything is good. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Mole =)",
        "Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return.",
        "Risotto = basically rice in Cheese Whiz. \\nGnocchi = supermarket-shelf pasta, drenched in cream.\\nWine selection abhorrent.\\nWay overpriced. \\nOne of the most depressing Italian meals of my life.\\nAmbiance? Huge, glaring TV screens, inexperienced wait staff, dark lighting (could barely see my plate!)",
        "Mediocre at best. Overpriced grill chicken over rice. There's not even an option for brown rice. Was really excited was the reviews. This will be our first and last time here. Family of 4 cost about $30.  Better off going to Braddah's Hawaiian food by Rainbow and Sahara. You won't be disappointed.",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!",
        "Son said his Mochi was hard. Hubby and I thought this place isn't as good as yogurtland as far as flavors and quality.",
        "This is my second visit and this time the food wasn't satisfying. I tried their T-bone steak and ask for it to be medium. It turned out to be too dry and over done. To top it off the steak was cold. Compared to the last time, I ordered the chicken and waffle which was to die for. I was a little disappointed this time.",
        "Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!",
        "I truly love golds. Clean facility , friendly staff, and my favorite part : the cardio cinema ! Not to mention the wonderful personal trainers, namely Jamie. She is always friendly and motivating. I've learned so many great work outs that I can easily replicate at home. The prices are reasonable as well.",
        "Ate here on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very good and big! I got the SMORES COFFEE drink. Very good. It had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. We shared the MAN VS FOOD favorite SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT! Very good and plenty of food for 2. Service was great as well.",
        "My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",
        "Mediocre food, but great service. Lots of comfy seating with great views of different TVs and games.",
        "I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but this place is delicious. I've been here a few times and got a couple different sandwiches and one of their bowls and everything I've had was really good. I'll take their Big WAC over a Big Mac any day.",
        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",
        "The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !",
        "Mediocre in every way.  Service and food.  Overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name.  The whole place looked tired and past prime.",
        "I'm writing this at the bar at BRI. I just finished the stacked enchilada. So very good!! It was pretty spicy but not in an overwhelming way. Super tasty!! \\n\\nThe other night I had the Spanglish sandwich. That was another huge winner!! \\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty good too!\\n\\nYou should check this spot out!",
        "M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.",
        "Not the best place to dine at. If you want to watch sports, they have alot of TVs but there are better places to go. Also, very smoky environment. I got a headache from staying there too long. I tried their all you can eat fish and chips....its mediocre. I rather pay a little extra for better quality.",
        "This place is very small but packs a huge flavorful punch to your taste buds! Made me an instant fan! I had the #1 carne machado, beef empanada & the coconut with cheese pastelito. I also tried the guava & cheese pastelito, that thing was amazing! I loved every morsel of all the good food I was able to try.",
        "We came here on a regular basis until they started wrapping our three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole in paper rather than the little black boxes that always came in. Now the guac I get charged extra for, is all over the paper and not on my tacos. I'll go elsewhere moving forward.",
        "Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!",
        "Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty. I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty. I ordered a few of there specialty rolls such as the Lobster roll and the Eel and Avocado roll. They were both good but nothing really that amazing to make me go back. They do offer other selections other than sushi.",
        "Kimberly the waitress was nice and helpful when ordering as for the differences in ribs.  As for the ribs I ordered spare ribs and the baby back ribs both were good. For the sides I got fries, onion rings, potato salad, and coleslaw nothing great.  Definitely would go back again",
        "It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.",
        "Wonderful experience. Nice little sushi house. The fish was fresh and the rolls were rolled nicely and balanced in flavor. \\n\\nOur server - short with curly hair - was very knowledgable and kind. \\n\\nI checked in with yelp and whereas it says that you receive a free appetizer with a check in, that's incorrect. You get a gross sweet little cocktail-type drink. I was kinda annoyed by that.",
        "Food is overpriced. Service is awful. They give you two tiny pieces of bread with a sizeable appetizer, but when you ask for more bread, they act like you're robbing them. They are all incredibly rude, including the chef. Terrible ambiance, no music. Trying to be New York. Waste of time, head to Herb Box, right around the corner.",
        "This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .",
        "It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.",
        "Get some late night dessert here and receive free entry to the club. The desserts here are so pretty, that you'll have to take a picture before you take a bite. Too bad the dessert doesn't make up for the lame club there have here afterwards. The music is wack and I just can't dance to wack music.",
        "Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday.",
        "Even though I wasn't able to have  Gimme Some Sugar make my wedding cake I knew that I wanted to stop by their new bake shoppe while I was in Vegas. My husband and I were not disappointed. The opera cake is a must! I even picked up a few gifts for family while I was there and was told that the birthday cake macaroon was AMAZING!",
        "The sandwich filling options are good, but the bread is dry, crumbly, and tastes mass produced. With options like milio's and Jimmy john's so close by with much better bread, it's hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here.",
        "Definitely some of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I always look up to gay people when it comes to things artistic. I'll definitely be adding food to that list. Get any sandwich with avocado in it, shit is on point. 5 Star Stunna!!!!!",
        "Sulky customer service every time I've been here. They also skimp on the portions compared to other Milio's locations in Madison."

        "Not a place you can judge by its location or ambience - you just have to eat the food! Delicious and unique - not getting these dishes anywhere else in Madison. When we moved on to dessert, the chef brought us out 2 piping hot leaves filled with sticky, sweet rice (wish I knew the names of these dishes...) The host was very friendly and answered all questions we had. We look forward to returning for more!",

The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",

Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",

        "Great Breakfast food...expecially the skillets.\\nConsistent style and portions...I really like the chicken, bacon, avocado skillet. However, I'm not a big fan of the coffee...i think it's quite bitter. but they have fresh squezzed O.J....and great whole grain pancakes.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "Good Day\\nA week before Christmas we arrived in Las Vegas.  Visiting our daughter who lives in the area.\\nTruly memorable,  great food , excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet. Christmas songs, great food,  wonderful ambience. \\nWill definitely be back .",
        "Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.",
        "Ewwww! I drive by this place everyday. Thought I would give it a shot today. I took 2 bites and had to throw the rest away. I will never come here again. The owners should be embarrassed to serve this slop. I wish I could get my $7 back.",
        "So dirty, super greasy menu. Dirty plates. Food was bad. Bad interior. Very bad overall experience. I'm just being honest.",
        "We recently dined there while visiting family in Scotland.  The food was very mediocre.  I ordered the salmon. I took a couple of bites and knew it was NOT fresh. I called the waitress and told her.  She said she would tell the chef. They did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it. I became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish. Not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse.  We would never go there again!",
        "Sorry, this place sucked. It was crowded, the service was absolutely awful and the food was mediocre. I was literally asked for my I'D 3 separate times (I'm 45 by the way) AND you're only \\\"allowed\\\" 1 drink at the bar per ID.... even though the waitress at the table took at least 45 minutes between rounds..... yeah,  NEVER going back to this establishment.",
        "Totally fits in with the willy street culture.\\n\\nLove that a chain name is UNIQUE and actually has familiar faces that you recognize whenever you visit.\\n\\nYou can get almost everything you want from Ace Hardware Center!! Snacks, drinks, tools, kitchen gadgets, cleaning agents, furniture. Wow, I'm grateful for Willy street Ace hardware!!",
        "Love the music here, a mix of 70's, 80's and 90's. The burgers are grass fed all beef and are very delicious and if you're in the mood for comfort then get some wings they are bigger than Buffalo Wild Wings and they have a good selection of sauces to go with and even have an all you can eat wing option and all you can eat salad bar. We will be back and nice touch with the throwback arcade games.",
        "I love Mojo Yogurt! You can't go wrong with a frozen yogurt company on Mill Avenue. With their late hours, you can practically get a cup at any time!\\n\\nHere's a tip: hit up the goodies bar before you fill your cup with yogurt. Layering the goodies can be fun! And if you are really adventurous, ask for the Cheesecake Bites that they store in the refrigerator in the back. YUM!",
        "My wife just got a haircut at this place and she seems to be pretty happy with her experience. Full marks for the ambience. The stylist name was Nathan and he seemed to be friendly and did a great job. Will be going there again. I strongly recommend R Salon.",
        "Restaurant moved location about two years ago, and the menu was changed a bit.  Still a diner atmosphere, and on our recent visits the food was only fair.  Service was very slow and they may have been understaffed.  It's OK as far as restaurants go, but there are several nearby that we prefer.  Meals are not too pricy, but the food is mediocre at best.",
        "We ventured out to this great place and we weren't disappointed. The Backyard burger will become a tradition for my Vegas visits. The Biloxi chicken sandwich and steak salad are also very very good.   Service was polite and professional and though we had a trainee for our meal, everything went well. I'd recommend this place to anyone for a reasonably priced well prepared meal.",
        "Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!",
        "This place was great. I really haven't had a better pedicure. The massage was long, the hot stones (included!) were amazing, and the chairs were comfortable. The atmosphere was nice as well. Typical nail salon interior, but the employees were nice, not all on their phones (which happens a lot in other salons), and it was a relaxing place to be. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I will continue to come here for pedicures!",
        "We used a groupon for my wife and I and enjoyed the massage/detox. They didn't short us any time and the only comment I would make is to communicate if the masseuse is too strong. They will happily cater to your needs and we left feeling relaxed and refreshed. They massaged our heads, necks, shoulders, arms, feet, and legs. Overall we were very happy.",
        "This buffet is very strong with food quality and comfort. The buffet has a great feel to it and doesnt look like a buffet when you are seated and see big windows. The good is good and has a big meat and cheese section. However the selections are fairly limited and it is a little smaller compared to a lot of other places you will see in town. The deserts are excellent though.",
        "Horrible service, ok burgers, good fries. Overpriced and a la carte ordering (burgers and fries separate). Waitress didn't place our order with the kitchen then offered 15% off after waiting 1.5 hours for burgers and fries. Nice patio seating in Oakland.",
        "It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it.",
        "Food not that good, fair price though. I ordered a chocolate and is way too sweet! You can't even take 2 or three bites because you will get sugar rush.",
        "Cupcakes and cake bites are great, though the red velvet needs some work. While not a selling point for me, they have milk on tap to wash the goodies down.",
        "Guys must wear shirts with sleeves, even when the weather is ridiculously hot in Vegas.  Pricy, but the food and interior make up for it.  Lots and different choices of things to be put on the your plate. Their desserts are actually good compared to other buffets. Their corn on the cob is super delicious!!!",
        "This place is terrible. So bad we lied to get out of staying a second night. Light and air don't work. It's liken a renovated motel 6, so shitty",
        "I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.",
        "Nice selection, local hangout spot, poorly located. At least currently it requires a walk slightly out of the comfort zone for some. Worth it if you aren't too cautious though.",
        "I was very impressed with the service received from Pure Plumbing. They were quick, reasonably priced and did a good job. The serviceman put on slippers so he did not bring dirt into our house. He was very friendly and helpful with advice. He cleaned up the area worked on before leaving. I received a thank you note along with a Starbuck's gift card. I will certainly recommend Pure Plumbing to others.",
        "Majestic Cabinets refinished the cabinets in my entire house. They did an amazing job and the price was very reasonable as well. They were flexible as well when I changed my mind on color in the kitchen. They also have several other references that you can call that all recommend this company!!!!!",
        "The roast beef was bland and boring. It took a long time. Didn't love the ambience.\\n\\nI always get a little annoyed when I see someone review a fancy restaurant (that I love) and criticize them for their $20 hamburger, so perhaps I should be a little kinder here given what might be appropriate expectations - but honestly I expected something...more.",
        "Spotty service, haughty attitude, and mostly food misses has brought this place down. Terrible accompanyments ruin the burrata and mozzarella. The pastas are heavy and after trying them all, there is only 1 I would ever order again. This place tries to be a foodie find but after several disappointing visits, it's time to give up.",
        "Apparently they don't staff appropriately for a Saturday night.  we didn't wait long to be seated but waited for the server.  The bathrooms were terrible wikth no toilet paper  except for entire roll in the toilet and towels all over the floor.  The server Leo was good.  The water also tasted bad like there was mold somewhere.",
        "The food here is good and I like the decor but they over-season everything.\\nFor example, my chicken liver mousse had apple slices and a spoonful of honeycomb and some sweet purplish sauce around it; when I took a bite of the liver without any of the accompaniments it already tasted sweet and nothing like liver.\\nIf I wanted a cup of cream and sugar, I wouldn't have ordered coffee!",
        "Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.",
        "Very polite service when I called Rakeman plumbing yesterday.  Charlie was at my house within the hour without having to pay a diagnostic fee as with two other plumbers I called.  Fantastic service, polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  Will definitely use again.  Thank you Charlie!",
        "I guess you have to try it at least once to say you did.\\n\\nWe had the sweetest lady for our server, so the service was excellent.\\n\\nThe food was your typical cowboy fare...not bad, not great.  \\n\\nThe entertainment was heee-larious.  I felt like I should've worn a ten-gallon hat.\\n\\nIt's tourist-y, for sure :o)",
        "One of the most frustrating layouts of a restaurant I've ever been to. Two \\\"front\\\" doors, bathrooms placed too far away from the bar and the dining area, strange patio layout.\\n\\nFOOD: Possibly the best French onion soup I've had in Phoenix. The burger wasn't earth shattering, but was good.",
        "Very family oriented.... Which is disappointing for our group with no children. Needs an adult only pool, needs more adult oriented activities. Beer or wine tasting? Very small gym. Buildings are awkwardly set up. Had to walk down a hall literally the length of a football field to get to our room, no stair access from first floor. Rooms were very nice though. Very large bathrooms and great patio space. Grills for cooking outside are super clean.",
        "I had my wedding reception here and it turned out amazing! Lalana was great with every aspect of planning my wedding. The food was amazing, the service everything! I was so happy I chose to have my reception here, it made our day even more unforgettable!",
        "Unprofessional. Really nice interior design though!",
        "I had an issue with plumbing and did needed it fixed that evening.  Service was quick (only had an hour window) an problem was fixed quickly.  I definitely recommend Freddy Fox Rooter",
        "This place has it all: the food, courteous staff and ambience.  The Shepard's Pie and Bread Pudding are out of this world.  Be prepared for large portions!  I enjoyed looking around at the interesting old photos and memorabilia on the walls.  Try it and it will become one of your favorites."

        "Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!",

I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)",
        "Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",

        "Went back today for lunch. I had the Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. It was fabulous. Had great flavor, crunchy bread. Came with fries and a drink. \\nThe sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. \\nI had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. \\nThe lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome.",
        "High pressure sales tactics and an average product. It was funny to listen to the guy tell me how much better their solution was that my current one and then try to justify why it was going to cost almost twice as much for approximately 1/2 the channels. I think I will stick with DISH.... however, I would use them over COX.",
        "I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in. It's about time to scale back the number of clients and/or appointments you take. Look, I've even had enough time to write this review AFTER reading all the others.",
        "Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "Food is always great but the service was horrible.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. There was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored. Next time I want Chompie's I will be going to location in Tempe!",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "Went there with a party of 9 and they refused to seat us together. Service was awefull and food took over an hour. They were not busy.   Some people liked the food, some didn't. My spaghetti carbonale was very dry, not good at all.  \\nDefinitely don't recommend this place.  they just didn't seem to care.",

The Front Desk Staff was no help. \\\"Frank\\\" The weekend Manager in Charge  and The Security Officer were the only ones that were helpful.

I am 100% sure it's this place because it's the only thing I had eaten all day - I'm here for CES.

        "Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. \\n\\nI had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste.",

The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",
        "HEAVEN. Hea.  Ven.  Heaven.  These folks do cured and encased meats REALLY well.  Took home tons of their chorizo and hot soppresata, which in Los Angeles would sell for 3 times the price.

Service is great, too!",

It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",

        "The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly.",

        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town.

So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!",
        "This is one of our favorite places to go.  Good food, love the omelets and of course the bacon.  Good coffee.  Service can depend on who's area you are seated in, but over all we haven't had a bad experience.  Make sure if you go at lunch that you order before any big groups, it can take a while.",

        "The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25",
        "I really enjoy Pei Wei and will continue to eat here. I find it is better to stick with what you like when ordering however. I went for lunch over the weekend, and my girlfriend and I both tried something new. We were both disappointed with our meals, especially because they were both too heavy on the sauce. The staff was friendly and the food came out quick. I still plan to attend and stick with the healthy options they offer on the menu.",
        "Just ok. Nothing worth the hype. Def not worth waiting in line. You're probably there to just experience it and call it a day! Super cute inside and staff was friendly. I will say I didn't try the sweets, only breakfast food. So maybe that was the issue.",
        "Great place for fast lunch!!! The buffet is always stocked here! Keep it up! Easy to get in and out of.",
        "Two words: KIDS SUITE!\\n\\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!",
        "The food here was pretty good. But the service was very slow. And we had a cranky kid with us which you would think would speed them up a little bit. But that didn't help. They don't have high chairs or boasters so I would say this place is NOT kid friendly. If you want to try it leave the little ones at home for this one.",
        "Hamburgers and Onion Rings - the bomb.  They are good.  Service - can't say much for that.  First time, service was not good at all.  Second visit, service was better, but they messed up our orders.  Tortillas soup - 10.00 - very brothy, not much else in it.  Perfect place for burgers and onion rings.",
        "For the fans of Bueno Burger it's no bueno because the lights have been turned off at this location. I was going to do lunch on New Year's Day and there was a For Lease sign. It's a shame, the lady who ran this place was so accomodating. She let me crash there while waiting for AAA after I pulled into the adjacent parking lot with a flat tire a couple of months ago.",

You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.",
        "I like Big Buddha for its fresh taste, price, portions, and speed. I love it when I call in an order and when I get there (only 5 mins away) its almost always done I rarely have to wait for anything. I'm not real big on there fried rice seems like its just like the white rice with some Soy sause mixed into it... But over all a go place to go.",
        "15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\\n\\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.",
        "I would rate the food but it never came. I contacted them again after an hour and half of waiting and they told me they are 10 minutes away. Another 20 minutes has gone by and no pizza so I contacted them once more and now they tell me they forgot to tell the kitchen about my order. Good gosh, how incompetent are they, oh and terrible liars when they told me they are 10 minutes away they should have realized my order is not cooking.",

        "The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it.",
        "Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!",
        "28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well.

        "Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. \\n\\nNice low-key atmosphere.\\n\\nFood is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",
        "I love this place because of the great food and I enjoy how they have a separate dining area from the bar. The different styles of burgers are great! We enjoyed watching a hockey game on the big screen in the dining room. Go on a Monday when the burgers are $5. I personally wouldn't pay $8-11 for a burger.",
        "Really enjoyed myself at the Auto Collections! The cars are beautiful, and there are so many of them! \\n\\nPrice is reasonable (12.50 I believe).\\n\\nWould recommend to anyone who loves old cars!",
        "I brought my car to Clean Freak today. When I got out, the car looked like it was never washed.  Although I paid for the 5.00 wash, I expected my car to be a least clean when it came out. The wash did not even remove a leaf that was on my car! I went to the car wash at 59th and Bell. Will never go again!",
        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "Horrible customer service. Asked if there was a wait, they stated \\\"\\\"No, we can take you now.\\\" Was seated to soak and I waited 15 min. They took another customer before me and I asked again at this point how long was the wait. They stated 10 more min. Was more upset that they lied about taking me right away and still didn't apologize for having me wait. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Just like most reviews on here say, these wings are delicious! I have tried about 8 of the flavors, all were great. They Cajun Hot were the best ones out there. The reason a star in lost is because of the customer service there. The cashiers are all nice and friendly. They people in back are always giving the worst looks to the customers. Oh well. It tastes good. A little bit higher on the price scale, but the wind size makes up for it.",
        "I've been here several times now for lunch and I took dinner to-go a couple of times too. My only complaint abt this place was that there is no one to greet or seat you upon entering. That appears to be fixed. The service was great. Food was delicious. I'm so glad this new place opened. I actually drive past Thai Orchid to come to this place now.",
        "A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \\n\\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \\n\\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available.",
        "Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place.  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon.  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices.  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich!!  Yikes.  We will not return.",
        "I am sorry but this show was just plain BOOORING, the big fat stupid baby is just lame, the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny. \\nDont think im not a Cirque fan because I am, I loved KA and Zumanity, but Mystere is just overated, skip it.\\nVery blah.",
        "Came in at lunchtime, first thing very noisy! Margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos . Enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic",
        "This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial.",
        "Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved! So gross! Never will I stay here again!! The manager of the hotel didn't even take time to contact me and fix this issue terrible terrible costumer service.",
        "Tried the eclairs..chocolate & vanilla.  Absolutely wonderfull!  The vanilla was made with real vanilla beans, no extract or flavoring.  Filling was light & creamy.  Moderate pricing for such a high quality product.  The eclairs cost $5.00 for the two and each eclair was about eight inches long.  I would've gladly paid $5.00 for just one!",
        "Oh my goodness! This place is amazing!\\nIt's like a subway but with pizza.\\nIt's a cute place with very nice and friendly staff.",
        "Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!",
        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "Alway a very good lunch...make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal!  Opa!",
        "Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.",
        "My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood.",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "Food was very good! Great breakfast variety and lunch options as well. Love the dog friendly patio! Amanda was a great waitress! Very friendly :) I will definitely be coming back.",
        "I stopped for lunch on Wednesday of this past week and ordered Crispy Noodle Chicken Chow Mein.  The chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken.  It was long pieces of light and dark meat with connective tissue that made it very, very strange looking and nothing like any chicken meat I've ever seen.  The owner came out and I asked him what is this.  I said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners.\\n\\nI will never go back there again.",
        "Cute place, but a bit pricey-good setup on Saturday mornings next to the farmers market. I had a slice of the banana bread which was good and the world's smallest mocha, which wasn't that good and was $4. I feel better knowing I got a free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  I will have to try some food next time I'm near here.",
        "This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival.",
        "Cute little cake/crepe shop! Good place to go for a dessert!\\n\\nI tried the greentea cake & it was delicious! It was layered with azuki cream filling. \\nThey had all sorts of pastries (strawberry shortcake, cream puffs, custard pudding, etc) \\n\\nNext time I'm definitely going to try their crepes! It looked so yummy~",
        "I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner.",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "Have only had 1 massage here.  It was ok; felt more like a sports massage (with stretching involved) than a relaxing one.  I prefer the atmosphere and massage techniques at Dolce.  I do frequent this place for brow waxing, even though they did burn me once.  Cute place though.",
        "Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again.",
        "Highly recommend Caroline for eyebrow waxing. Nice touch, great attitude, & funny!\\n\\n(Highly recommend not being Indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing.)",
        "Second time coming here this week-delicious! I love the topping selection, how QUICK they cook your pizzas (I have a short lunch break), and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on. Yum!",
        "I got ripped off.  Granted I didn't bring my confirmation number with me, they could not find my reservation at the gate and when I called customer service, since date had passed - no refund was available. Will not use the internet to  pay for parking again.  I am pissed that I got screwed out of 28.00."
