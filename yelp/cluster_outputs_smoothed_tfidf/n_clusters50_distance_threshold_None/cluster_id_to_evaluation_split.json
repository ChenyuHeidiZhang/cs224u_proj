        "This starbucks is awful. They don't listen when you're ordering don't apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time. Their rude and unworthy of my business.",
        "It's a pool supply store.   I usually don't go to these places, but I was trying to get a solar blanket for my pool....I had all the blue prints, but still not enough info!  Really!   Dammmm it, I have to go back again!",
        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",
        "My daughter and I went last Sunday for lunch. We were seated in about 10 minutes so that was good however, that was the beginning of the end. After 15 minutes I had to get the attention of the busboy and asked him if he could be sure we weren't forgotten.  About 5 minutes later the busboy brought water and said the server was coming. NOT!  We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin.",
        "This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "If you just imagine you're in mainland China, this will feel right. Service is a bit strange,  but it's traditional Chinese service. I come for the ever elusive, hard to find chichen chop suey, and I love it !",
        "This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are \\\"man\\\" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!",
        "I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business.",
        "I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.",
        "I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.",
        "THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass.",
        "Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location",
        "My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.",
        "Really nice 5 mile hike that was easy on the knees.",
        "The buffalo blue cheeseburger is delicious.\\n\\nSmells good had to stop\\nCan't get enough of that blue cheese buffalo burger smells and\\nTastes so good you got to try it.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "I had the Lobster Burger! Yes, I said Lobster Burger. It was PHENOMENAL! OMG! I have never had anything like it. THE best thing I have ever put in my mouth!\\nThe service was impeccable! This place rocks! Open 24/7 too!",
        "Just like many other Ritas, but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store.  Only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options",
        "Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Overpriced for a hot dog, but you do get a huge ass wiener.\\n\\nI'm a girl that craves nacho cheese after midnight, so the Mojave Dog was the hot dog of choice and boy did it hit the spot.  \\n\\nI'm glad they were open at 2AM  and I didn't have to go looking for a 7-11.  :)",
        "Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. \\nOf course we will be back.",
        "$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\\n\\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's.",
        "5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot.",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "From the ride up to the museum to strolling through the grounds, this museum is world class.\\nI usually check the current exhibits before planning a trip there. I will visit again this weekend for the Jackson Pollack exhibit. If it is a clear day, the views are incredible. If you are in AZ   and only\\nhave time to visit one museum, this one or the  Clark County Museum Villa should be your choice.",
        "Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the \\\"Sun City rush\\\" is insane.  The ribs were amazing...",
        "Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.",
        "We loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff.  Get the free headsets to learn more details.  It had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art.  We saw some new (just new to us) techniques and mediums like casein paint, egg tempera, etc. Very nice little gift shop.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "One word. BOMB. 1st timer at a Greek mediterranean restaurant all though I had Gyros b4. Found out I been pronouncing it wrong this hole time but let's get to the point. Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way.",
        "Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.",
        "Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.",
        "Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.",
        "The 4 star rating is not for the pizza alone (which is pretty good, not the best I have ever had but still very very decent, especially the white)... but rather for the \\\"secret\\\" factor, the location and just the fun it involves getting there, also the Cosmo is one of my favorite casinos on the strip.",
        "Good service....room was unique...neighbors next door partied til 6am...security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time...want to try Rumors next!!!",
        "The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \\\"MANAGERS\\\" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit.",
        "The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.",
        "Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.",
        "If you're a barbecue fan, this is the place for you.  Get the little pig if you're a beginner, its a good intro to BBQ.  The atmosphere is great, and on a sunny day there is no better place to grab a beer (specially on work lunch break - wink wink).  Parking can be a challenge at time but nothing too concerining.",
        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "Uh...horrible food. And I was even uh, under the influence...the kind where anything tastes good, and it was still bad. I wouldn't eat here if I were starving in the desert. The Palms was a great place to stay, the 24-7 Cafe had GREAT food. It's too bad the buffet was so bad....",
        "My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,",
        "3.5 Stars\\n\\nThis is my weekly grocery stop.  This Fry's location is clean and in the process of a remodel.  The deli carries Boar's Head meats which are my favorite!  Their fried chicken is so good.  The non-food items are generally more expensive than the evil super corporate mega grocery store.  Fry's will also multiply your coupons up to $1.",
        "Another win from Sing Sing. Emailed them a pdf at 6pm on Thursday. Got a quote and a proof back at 6:15pm. 2x3 custom foam board was done by 2pm the next day. 20hr turnaround. Not. Too. Shabby.",
        "gosh, Charlotte must have low standards in sushi. This place was fairly terrible. Threw away 80% of my order. Salmon should have a taste and rice should be white, not 50 shades of gray.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale.",
        "The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!",
        "I absolutely love Ace stores.  It's a clean store, they are very friendly, helpful and usually have what I need.  The one time they didn't, they researched it (rare item, didn't even find one for sale on the internet) and got back to me in a timely manner.  They weren't able to find the item; but, they found a much more affordable alternative!  :-)  That's worth 5 stars in my book!",
        "I got a good haircut and style at a decent price. The girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture. Theres a special right now - 7 foil highlights,cut, dry, waxed brows all for $60!",
        "I am very happy Madison finally has an antique oddities shop. I was pleasantly surprised by finding true medical antiquities and and just strange fun decor. The prices are quite reasonable and the store is displayed well. I will definitely be going back.",
        "I had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off! I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water!!! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!",
        "It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!\\nOk to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it.",
        "GREAT museum.  Loved it.  I usually spend a short time in museums, but the Warhol museum had my attention for houes.  Beautifully done, and I love that visitors can touch and interact with many of the exhibits.",
        "Enjoy the Vietnamese food the staff was friendly huge portions I would definitely get a couple of dishes for 5 friends and everybody share family style.",
        "I will give this place 5 stars, reason being is the contacted me to correct my mistake post. I did on the wrong Resturant. I appreciate owners that follow up\\nOn comments or customer experience. I do frequent vegas every couple months and I will  come here to eat, once again thank you for being understanding of my mistake. look forward to trying the Resturant out.",
        "Pretty good, though I like Thai Rama more. I wouldn't order any of the soups vegetarian as they are entirely too sour, but with chicken they are pretty good. The broth could use more depth in flavor in general. Ordered Spicy Thai Shrimp noodle dish. Everything looked grey on the plate- not very appetizing, but it tasted good. Curry is pretty good as well. All in all, it's good, but not my favorite.",
        "It was okay. Overpriced for average quality food. Don't think I \\nwould ever go again.\\n\\nThe wasabi was blue.",
        "Went here with my boyfriend he got a pedicure and I got a fill with gel. They both turned out great. My boyfriends calluses were horrible and he left with baby feet they went the extra mile to make sure his feet were smooth.  Bella did a great job with my french tips very clean looking.   It's nice to have somewhere open past 7. \\n\\nBe sure to call and make an appointment though to make sure you don't have to wait.",
        "They do not reinforce the curbing, they walk into your backyard at 6am unannounced and almost get shot. They rip up your stake markers for other projects. No one speaks understandable English. There contact at the office had an excuse for everything. Glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed. If you want to waste your time and money use these guys! Otherwise find a good company.",
        "I loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and I ate it two days in a row. This time I feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. I ordered 4 Earl's club sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -NADA! It also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. Eh I am officially sick of this place. I will not crave for it next time.",
        "OMG!  My boss took me here for lunch.  You order and pay for your order 1st.  The hamburgers were to die for.  The fries were very good and flavorful.  Fried twinkee is what we got for dessert.  I loved the whole meal and will bring family and friends back for sure.  I will take pictures next time so you can see how much you get for your money.  You will NOT be disapointed.",
        "I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.",
        "I went here many years ago and thinking that it was really impressive.  My latest trip has taken a 5 star review down to 3.  There really is nothing extraordinary about this buffet, other than the fact that it is in the Paris hotel.  The buffet is not really long either!  I remember there being a lot of fishy foods, which I could careless for.  The wait line on a Sunday evening was 1 hour!  It is NOT worth the wait!",
        "Found this place on yelp and just want to stop by bcos my brows getting out of control. When I was getting two people ahead of me and the wait was les than 10 minutes. Did my eyebrows and lip for $9.00 that first time $5 deal applied to my service. Wow!! What great experience and now I know where to go. Thank you fabulous eyebrow threading.!!!",
        "This place has the best grilled chicken, greek salad, and sauce. I haven't found a better greek restaurant in Phoenix. Give it a try and you'll see how good it is! I've been there 6 times and each time the food earned 5 stars. It's that good...",
        "We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a clean neat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at $5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip.",
        "We got a room for $35/night, a Motel-6 price for a better-than-Motel-6 room with much-better-than-Motel-6 amenities.  The pools are awesome.  You get a free drink pass.  Gym is pretty nice, too.  I approve.",
        "It's a nice addition to downtown wait staff is dicey at best.  Weird happy hour times. Blue martini goes till 7 and commonwealth goes till 9 pm.  Downtown cocktail room goes till 7 to.  There happy hr ends at 6 pm.  Hello!! Give it a one and done.",
        "I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience.  The bartenders are always friendly - and in the dinning room, Jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you.   Also, way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip.",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",
        "This is a great location on the strip - just a short walk to about any property you want. And the room rates are dirt cheap - $40 on the strip? OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.",
        "This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome.",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "We love going to Tivoli Village. We've been performing there for a few years now and every time they have been very gracious. We have our Camp Rocks! Summer Music Day Camp concert there this Friday, June 20th, at 6pm. We have 7 talented kids who will rock the stage after only 2 weeks together as a group. The concert is free and open to the public.",
        "Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying.",
        "I have not been to the dentist in a long time.  I recently went to Downtown Dental.  Everyone was very friendly; the hygienist, the dentist, and the receptionist.\\n\\nThe office is very nice, clean, and very conveniently located.  I showed up about 5 minutes early and was greeted and seen without a wait.  I will definitely be going back.",
        "Waste of money!  Had a great salesman on the phone who sold me into everything I would get....I asked very specific questions to make sure I was picking a place to fit my needs.  They have fancy machines but are completely unhelpful.  I give them a ZERO out of 5.",
        "Good sports bar lacking in beer selection but all in all cheap greasy food to soak up the booze and if u got a itchy finger to win the got the vlts too",
        "This place sells... Yup, you guessed it! Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on.",
        "Bummer. I was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich. Stopped by Friday 7/27 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here.",
        "The drunken noodles..... Get them now. \\n\\nThe restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. \\n\\nPrice 3.5/5 average \\nAtmosphere 3/5 \\nFood 5/5",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "I didn't have any coupons so paid 7.49 plus tax for this place.  I was pretty happy until I went to Main Street Cafe and paid 7.99 for three times the variety of food.  However, if you gots the coupon, then Paradise might be your bet.  I could really only find chicken worth eating...oh and a few items from the dessert area.",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure."

        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!",
        "We recently dined there while visiting family in Scotland.  The food was very mediocre.  I ordered the salmon. I took a couple of bites and knew it was NOT fresh. I called the waitress and told her.  She said she would tell the chef. They did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it. I became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish. Not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse.  We would never go there again!",
        "Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "Awesome place!!\\n\\nDecor is rad feels like Im at someone house in Japan for eats. and just about everything off the menu is delish. I return often!",
        "If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\\nI don't mess with meat there",
        "Not a fan. He keeps shilling fad \\\"diet\\\" and \\\"nutritional\\\" products from some website, claiming he doesn't make a dime on them. Other issues I won't discuss here.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",
        "Holy Tequila!  Luv the margaritas here!  House margaritas are the best.  I highly recommend the Cucumber margarita!  Its cool and refreshing with the perfect amount of tequila.  Great drink for the hot AZ summer!  Tinga tacos are my absolutely favorite.  Great crunchy chicken taco!  Great place in OT for some awesome food and drinks.  This is one of the best happy hour locations in town!",
        "$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\\n\\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's.",
        "Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\\n\\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed.",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",
        "my friend and I tried two different tasting menu there. Generally it was good, but just felt a little bit over priced. I paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of Rose and tip, tax. If you never tried any modern mixture of French and Japanese cuisine, I would recommend it.",
        "Big portions, good flavor, great prompt service, great price.  Pancakes  than IHOP, waffles better than Waffle House, French toast better than...making it yourself.  Will be back.",
        "Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "New Mexico Chile soup, salad and beer bread - yum! German sausage plate - yes! Chocolate paired with beer ( you can't leave without tasting the tri -pepper pairing), what's not to like? Pub food does not have to be greasy frat food. Thank you, Great Dane, for a fabulous lunch!",
        "Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.",
        "This is my home away from home take out tasty meal. The Chinese Chicken Salad is where it's at. Fresh, tasty, quick. OK, so sometimes I\\\"m too lazy to make something healthy... so they do it for me. Eat half now and save the rest for later - 2 meals in one! And they're nice too.",
        "Absolutely delicious! Very friendly service as well.\\n\\nGot 2 broths, Thai and Chinese, with 2 meats (shabu beef and pork loin), 2 vegetables (shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage), 1 house special firm tofu, and oval noodles.",
        "This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les \\u00c9clusiers should be a blip on your radar.",
        "Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!",
        "Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.\\nMy Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.\\nFriendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.\\nExtra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!",
        "Fair prices [including kids size] and great specialty flavors! Saw them @ First Friday and it was definitely a great stop on a hot June day. Quick and friendly service with a smile! They drive their truck to many locations so call and see where they are located and go get one of their shaved ice treats!",
        "this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",
        "This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again.",
        "Very good authentic Chinese food.  Located upstair in Chinatown alley.",
        "We went to this place with my husband to see if they had any Argentinean empanadas, or argentinean dough to make them, but they do not have anything Argentinean , it is all Ecuatorian , it is really good food. \\nBut we were looking for Argentinean , anyway is good. I did not like the meat, very spicy , and we Argentineans do not like spicy food.",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "Service is spotty, we had a bartender reading a book about juicing while out drinks sat empty but another bartender when he wasn't on break was fabulous.\\n\\nDrink prices are high, as expected.\\n\\nWe ordered french fries which were alright but nothing to write home about.",
        "i think this is closed??? their website is suspended?",
        "Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average.  There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland.  I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food.  Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back.",
        "Went here with my boyfriend he got a pedicure and I got a fill with gel. They both turned out great. My boyfriends calluses were horrible and he left with baby feet they went the extra mile to make sure his feet were smooth.  Bella did a great job with my french tips very clean looking.   It's nice to have somewhere open past 7. \\n\\nBe sure to call and make an appointment though to make sure you don't have to wait.",
        "This place is a valley institution. Bring cash. Don't feed the pigeons. Outdoor seating but misters help cool in the summer. Their fish is an acquired taste so I understand some of the negative reviews. My wife hates it so I eat here by myself. (She is not a local anyway).  I recommend the 4 piece fish and chips with an extra 2 oz special sauce. I have been eating here since I was a kid and hope to be eating here well into my retirement.",
        "I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.",
        "Fresh Vegan (cold raw food). Great taste and creativity. I had the Pad Thai and it was delicious. Only it didn't taste anything like real Pad Thai. Nice beer choices. Juices and other 'healthy' beverages are expensive.  All in all I would go again and I recommend you all to try it.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "I just called the Rolfs Salon at Gainey Village, what happened to Delores Leiva? Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.",
        "We heard great things about this place and decided to give it a shot for breakfast and we were sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre and was served lukewarm. The service was slow and inconsistent. We had to request our check from the host stand since the waitress never returned, the owner was visiting most of the tables, but never stopped by ours, and the price was expensive for what we got. The only upside was the french toast special we split was yummy.",
        "I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.",
        "This was disgusting ,me and my fiance both felt sick after eating at this place.. compared other Chinese buffets in town, the price was even more expensive than some of them..seriously some of the cheaper ones were better than this... i would advice everyone to avoid this place",
        "Good food, but dining in isn't recommended! I'll stick to delivery next time! Parents were craving Chinese and from our experience from delivery the food was good but didn't think dining in would be that bad! .... They should just be a delivery resto, no dining in.",
        "Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction",
        "The company was much better than the food.  China Panda could give them a run for thier money.",
        "Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.  The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Went for lunch. Ordered African peanut soup and a salami sandwich. Both were good. BF was less impressed with his schnitzel, he thought the portion size was too small but thought it tasted ok. Would like to try dinner, maybe do a big German meal. Not sure if I can get him to go back, however. A little pricey for meal size. He was still hungry after lunch.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.",
        "Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.",
        "Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\\n\\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!",
        "Hotel very good and very good location, close to shops and the Staple Center. Parking inside the hotel quite convenient, but a little expensive. The facility, which sits on top of the building is very good and has great view. The hotel restaurant is also good and not too expensive. We take breakfast at Starbucks, it has one inside the hotel.",
        "Awesomely authentic German bier!",
        "Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.",
        "The curry house I have been hunting for.\\n\\nAfter living in Japan for a number of years, I developed a slight addiction to CoCo curry. For years, I have been searching to find something here in the States that could satiate my CoCo craving, and Zen nailed it.\\n\\nThe service is outstanding, always pleasant and willing to meet my special requests, food is spot-on every time I go.\\n\\nI love this place.",
        "Come one come all Cornhusker fans!!! This is the place!!!Bar food is bar food- but this place ranks higher. The nachos were fresh, pretzel bites DELISH!",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "The drinks are awesome. While the food is pretty good, It adds up since they are small plates. Don't go there hungry, but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer. Always prepare for an hr wait.",
        "All I had in my mind was a perfectly flaky croissant, but Nova's didn't exactly deliver.  The croissant was okay, but not necessarily flaky.\\n\\nI also purchased a loaf of french bread but was a bit disappointed as well.\\n\\nI like that this place is open 24 hours a day and that they have parking, but if I can, I think I'd choose Amelie's over Nova's.",
        "Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy.",
        "We had a stellar meal at this classic restaurant.  Both of us had the tasting menu which was amazing especially the wild mushroom and white truffle risotto...very generous shavings of truffle.  If this restaurant doesn't make you feel romantic, nothing will! Impeccable service and wonderful french food.... It rates as one of the more memorable meals of my lifetime and that's saying a lot from a die hard foodie.",
        "The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !",
        "I have been to all the Ah-So Sushi locations and this is by far the best one! Go to Mr. Kim and ask for a Mr. Kim #4. Best susji I've ever had!!!",
        "This was one of the worst Chinese food meals I've ever had. Diabetics should steer clear of the General Tao chicken -- it would be less sugary if they just doused it in maple syrup. I've had better food out of a catering truck at half the price.",
        "This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.",
        "This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!",
        "Mediocre Chinese food. The quality of food was not so good. The service was even worse. The bill was not calculated correctly. And the waiter was not there when we need him. Perhaps that was because of a busy Friday...\\n\\nOverall, I would like to recommend other Chinese restaurant on Murray, such as Rose Tea or Ka Mei.",
        "Came here on a holiday (June 24TH). Very dissatisfied. Employees lounging around, mumbling waiter, dry food... I guess the staff here today would rather be home watching fifa. Hopefully for the owner the food and atmosphere is better on regular days. What a waste of time, thank god most plates are only 10$.",
        "Was super excited to enjoy shaved snow in my neighborhood but that excitement quickly diminished after one taste.  Overly priced and not worth the cost.  I'll continue to drive to China Town for some yummy shaved snow.",
        "Great food, decent prices.  We got 2 breakfast plates and a coffee $13.99.  2 pancakes 2 eggs, potatoes,  2 sausage & 2 biscuits and gravy,  2eggs, bacon, potatoes.   We were seated within 5 minutes.   Service was nice and sufficiently fast.  They even made drinks to go.  Very awesome.",
        "Finally got here for dinner, heard about this restaurant from my friends many times! The food quality is good, environment is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese restaurants, I definitely will come back again!! Had a great dinner here!! Love it..!!!",
        "Three words: $5 RESORT FEE. What is a $5 resort fee you ask? Some made-up, #$%^&* charge they tack onto your bill because they realized that they didn't REALLY want to charge you what they advertised on their website.",
        "Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant.",
        "Tried various locations of Lindo around town, just not impressed. Just standard fare, with inflated prices.",
        "Disgusting Food !!!  Slow service !!! Waste of money.. I'm not coming back. All three dishes were bad, we left it almost untouched except French fries which was ok",
        "Everything is OK, prices are reasonable.  I think most of dishes are much sweeter than authentic Japanese style to me.  It is very casual place, it might be fun to come here after the long day to have fan.",
        "Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options",
        "This place is by far the best Chinese take out place that I gave eaten in. I lived in NY and been to California several times and this place is just as good or better!! You get a lot if food for little money!! They are quick with their deliveries or pick up order as well!! Keep up the good job guys!!!",

        "We went there with our friends from Germany to watch the amazing 7:1 soccer game. The food was great but our server LINDSEY was even greater! Super nice, patient, always a smile on her face and a great server! She made a good experience a great one. THANKS LINDSEY!!!!",
        "When we pulled up and I saw the name I simply thought wtf... The decor isn't very Japanese more Chinese and the menu also has tons of Chinese food also... The service was really god and the sushi chefs were cool as hell... So far this is the only place in Arizona I haven't complained about the sushi... It's not the greatest but I thought it was cool... so in my opinion its A-OK",

        "How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40.",
        "For places specializes in cupcakes the actual cupcake portion was mediocre at best. They are a little overpriced at about three dollars per cupcake which is a little high for something that quality is low. The cupcake looks larger than it actually is due to the icing being as tall as the cupcake itself. Not the worst place ever, but definitely not worth going out of your way for.",
        "Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.",
        "An absolutely unhesistant 5 stars. Best culinary experience I had in Pittsburgh and ranks up there among my best meals ever.\\n\\nLots of playing with textures, incredibly fresh ingredients, interesting flavour combinations, this place has it all. There were a lot of asian influences in the menu items and the chef leans towards more simple, elegant flavours that highlight the freshness of the ingredients.\\n\\nI loved every bite."

The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.

We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin.",

The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",
        "I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.",
        "This place is the worst,  they deserve NO STARS but Yelp wouldn't allow that. Terrible service,  bad food. DON'T GO!!!",
        "This place is great. Yes, like other yelpers said, it is a bit pricey but it's good clean food not 15 seconds in a microwave crap. You get what you pay for!!",
        "Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.",
        "The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).",
        "THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass.",

        "Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",
        "This place blows. They never have shit & what little they do have is expensive. If it wasn't the ONLY place within walking distance I'd never come to this Shithole. They need to put an AM/PM or a QT around this motherfucker! At least the cashiers are nice.",
        "4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "They always take the time with my kids and are very good.  Sometimes they have a waiting list and often are booked up....so I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment.  But it is very worth it as the results speak for themselves.",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Visited the aquarium sinve it was on the 10 must do things while in vegas. Nice aquarium but not everything advertised was available. An interesting place to visit but I'm not sure it's a must see if you are in vegas",
        "Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.",
        "The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.",
        "I ordered the Chicken Fajitas which were average.  The food is nothing special and the service is very slow.",

When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",

        "I'm not sure what your expecting for $16.99. I didn't mind it. I was on a diet when I ate here. It was doable but I did end up using all my calories at breakfast. Crazy, right? It was just average. It wasn't horrible. I've had horrible. It's just on the lower end for Las Vegas...or as the locals call it Vegas..or maybe they just say LV!",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.",
        "This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.",
        "I've seen first hand the work and quality Puddle Jumper Pool Service has performed and it's top notch! Why go with a corporation and be just another dollar bill when you can have great personal attention from a family owned and run business?! Give them a call, you won't be sorry!",
        "Great little independent place. The owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking. When in town I try to eat there a few times a month. I don't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly. They have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu. Its hard not to find something you will like.",
        "Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. \\nOf course we will be back.",
        "Big puddle in the floor on the to go side waited 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready ten minutes ago. Finally left after being ignored by staff. Will not be returning.",

        "Sat at the bar, no music or sound on the TVs, after I asked for the second time some music was turned on, some sort of low sounding reggae I think, could barely hear it. No food on the happy hour menu, $3 Cuba Libra's, I enjoyed those. Didn't sample the food. Might come back not sure yet.",
        "From the ride up to the museum to strolling through the grounds, this museum is world class.\\nI usually check the current exhibits before planning a trip there. I will visit again this weekend for the Jackson Pollack exhibit. If it is a clear day, the views are incredible. If you are in AZ   and only\\nhave time to visit one museum, this one or the  Clark County Museum Villa should be your choice.",
        "Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the \\\"Sun City rush\\\" is insane.  The ribs were amazing...",
        "This location is alright. Most of the staff members are actually quite nice, and they've made my many experiences here enjoyable and easy. I just wish they had just as much items as Costco :( Other than that, this place is alright. It can get crowded a little and sometimes not a lot of check out places are open, so lines are long. \\n\\nI'd still shop around here, since it's the nearest location.",
        "I am torn between three and four stars on this one. The food is decent but the portions are a little small for these prices. The small portions are somewhat offset by the various side dishes that are included in many of the menu items. I also appreciate how several of the menu items are healthy. The food itself was quite good but thats not saying much because I have never had terrible greek food before. They also have a decent patio which is a plus in my book.",
        "I've eaten here at least 10 different occasions since the opening a couple months ago. Usually go for the kabobs - chicken, steak and salmon are delicious! Great service, food is very quick and consistent! Great location being right off the I-10. Go!",
        "I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!",
        "This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.",
        "The only reason I came here was because the TI provided us with a 2 for 1 coupon. The food was over cooked and greasy, and some just tasted funny. The desserts were the only things that we ok, not horrible but not great either. Very disappointing!",

        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "Food was okay it earned the 2 stars. The wait staff is horrible. Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for napkins and I had to walk up my cup for a refill.",
        "The food is your standard, crappy Chili's food. However, as far as airport Chili's (and even regular Chili's) go, the staff here was the nicest and most efficient I've ever encountered. (Note: No alcohol is served anywhere in the Char airport before noon on Sundays.)",
        "Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE.",
        "The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.",
        "Cool place but there was one snobby blonde bartender who was totally just flat out ignoring the people next to us.  We decided to order for them because she would just not even acknowledge them.  I actually called her out on it and she gave me attitude, too bad she has such a terrible life that she has to let it show at work.  Other than that, the music is great, ambience is fun but laid back.  Small place but it's not too packed.",
        "This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",
        "The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the\\nPrice, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!\\nI would not go there again for sure!",

We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)",
        "This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \\nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!",
        "This is an update to my previous post.  I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street.  MAJOR MISTAKE!  It was way over priced, crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance.  I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert.\\n\\n I'll never cheat on you again Rehab!",
        "This is my home away from home take out tasty meal. The Chinese Chicken Salad is where it's at. Fresh, tasty, quick. OK, so sometimes I\\\"m too lazy to make something healthy... so they do it for me. Eat half now and save the rest for later - 2 meals in one! And they're nice too.",

        "The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",
        "If you're a barbecue fan, this is the place for you.  Get the little pig if you're a beginner, its a good intro to BBQ.  The atmosphere is great, and on a sunny day there is no better place to grab a beer (specially on work lunch break - wink wink).  Parking can be a challenge at time but nothing too concerining.",

Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",

The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired.

        "Saw a boxing match here.  No complaints.  The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",

        "Love this place! So glad that I decided to come here with my friend. Ask for Summer or Kate, they are fabulous and friendly! Love my mani pedi and definitely will be coming back to this cute little place.",
        "I had given up on West Elm, I had put them in the same category as Ikea until I walked into this location.  I have been to West Elm in Denver, San Diego, and in Virginia, but this location has the perfect store design and employees.  If you like West Elm you'll love this location.  If you've give up on West Elm, I suggest you give it one last try and visit this store.",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. \\nOf course we will be back.",
        "I don't remember what roll I ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top. \\nWe came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but I felt like we were rushed by the staff.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.",
        "Seen this place a few times, decided to walk in to ask for a menu,  they said no menu, just like that not helpful at all. Place was completely empty besides me then this security guard walked in and they offered him a sample but not me. Wanted to order a soup but was completely ignored then this lady who didn't understand English came out and couldn't help me at all so I left frustrated. With no food or tea!",
        "$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\\n\\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's.",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.",
        "Customer service!  Someone still has it this day in age!  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat!  To the employee who helped me:  Hats off to you good sir!",
        "Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",
        "Had a TB shots because I accidentally poked myself with the same syringe I used to inject my roommates dog with insulin and had a panic attack! Thought I had caught rabies or something crazy!\\n\\nCame here and was seen right away. Staff was friendly and alert. Place was clean with a HUGE waiting area. The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.",
        "my friend and I tried two different tasting menu there. Generally it was good, but just felt a little bit over priced. I paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of Rose and tip, tax. If you never tried any modern mixture of French and Japanese cuisine, I would recommend it.",
        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "I'll be short here.........Ummm NO.  As most people quote, yah the decor is nice...Well guess who's paying for that?  The consumer hence the overpriced drinks...Guess the concept works its always packed...",
        "Cool place but there was one snobby blonde bartender who was totally just flat out ignoring the people next to us.  We decided to order for them because she would just not even acknowledge them.  I actually called her out on it and she gave me attitude, too bad she has such a terrible life that she has to let it show at work.  Other than that, the music is great, ambience is fun but laid back.  Small place but it's not too packed.",
        "This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",
        "Conveniently located inside of Caesars Palace... However, they're not a part of the Total Rewards program that Caesars is a part of. \\n\\nWhy would this matter? Well, cause you can't claim your free birthday drink here! \\n\\nWhile not my personal favorite, it's not a bad bar to try...",
        "Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "Eat, Drink, Party, Sleep. Repeat.",
        "This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \\nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)",
        "DONT EVER GO TO THE SPA GUYS! As I was leaving I was approached by 2 security guards accusing me from two other guests that I was acting aggressively. I was upset and also uncomfortable. In the end I then proceeded to tell the security guards this is the last time I will come here. I told them that I felt very uncomfortable over accusations that were not true. DON'T EVER GO TO THE SPA AT LEXWORD MEN YOU MAY GET STOPPED BY SECURITY AND BE ACCUSED!",
        "One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!",
        "Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.",
        "The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.",
        "friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.",
        "A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.",
        "Still a Star Nails fan, and receiving the same good service.  Some of the nail technicians are more experienced and perform better work; overall good value for the price.",
        "Not impressed right off the bat. In a weird location right next to another mattress store. Walking in felt pressure right off the bat. \\n\\nWhen I mentioned I was just looking, I was quickly dismissed. We are needing three new mattresses and will be looking elsewhere. We suggest anyone else does as well.",
        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price.",
        "Very generous portions.  Had a quesadilla for lunch and it was very good.  While they give refills for the ice tea, they only give a can when one orders a soda.  If were to order a drink, I would probably order the ice tea, which I have heard from the members I was with, was good.",
        "Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \\nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.",
        "A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic.",
        "Regular run of the mill place.  Sufficient enough for the co-eds that run this street.  Was surprised that they didn't offer any taco or enchilada dinners, everything was just a la carte.  Drink special were reasonable.  Staff courteous.  \\n\\nI have nothing against homeless people, but the parking lot is crawling with beggers.  If you aren't happy with your meal, feed them!",
        "Update: went back today for my beloved Passion Tea Lemonade... it took 17 minutes from stepping in line until I finally got my drink. And to make it worse, my tea was luke warm at the bottom if the cup and only cold at top where the ice is.. how did they manage to pull that one off? Not shaking it properly? Who knows..",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.\\nWe didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. \\nBut I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale.",
        "How can you go wrong with Hickory Tavern? Just don't get the Tennessee Lemondae, unless you like weak drinks.",
        "Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",
        "Happy Hour is fun!  Great food and drink specials!",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "Nice people; Inconsistent haircuts\\n\\nI like the shop and the people.  It can be a little busy, so you know they are doing something well.  Prices are reasonable and it's a chance to watch some sports or an action flick while you get a trim.\\n\\nOnly knock is that I get a different haircut each time.  Same instructions, but depending on the person and the day, I can come out looking quite a bit different.",
        "Great food and great WINE. Awesome pasta, the description matched exactly what I got. When I asked the waiter to describe the wine I wanted to order, he described it to a T. What was just supposed to be a small appetizer and a drink turned into a meal. Very elegant, very nice, VERY GOOD!",
        "Had a great time here. Drinks are about $14 each so be ready. But the atmosphere was great. They get some really good talent spinning here too. Not a dance floor per se, but we did plenty of dancing (as did everyone else).",
        "the music is wayyyyy too loud, very nice staff but I felt like I couldn't have a conversation because the music was turned up so much.",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",
        "OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\\n\\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\\n\\nRun away -",
        "Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....",
        "Service is spotty, we had a bartender reading a book about juicing while out drinks sat empty but another bartender when he wasn't on break was fabulous.\\n\\nDrink prices are high, as expected.\\n\\nWe ordered french fries which were alright but nothing to write home about.",
        "Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.",

Our training class has helped Jagger and I so much! Thank you Leah!",

The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \\\"automatic 2-putt\\\" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again."

        "Great People, Great Shop. They have some of the best people in the industry working hard to make it happen and they offer better than new service. They have great accessibility and good group rides. I highly recommend them. The selection is just awesome there too. Parking isn't all that bad either. Check 'em out!",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",

        "Charlie is really friendly. If you introduce yourself, he will call you by name everytime you come back. The food is all really tasty. I'm partial to the house chili, but everything I've had there has been good. I think it's kind of healthy. I know it's inexpensive. And all the hot dishes come out piping hot, which is reassuring from a food safety perspective. You have to wonder about that aspect at competing restaurants.",
        "We love this place! The breakfast is homemade fresh and hot. The service is always great and very welcoming. My fianc\\u00e9 and I always try new places but end up back at good old Nicks. A couple times we had off days the food was just ok but it still nocked most places out of the water. Way to go Nicks we love ya",
        "Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.",
        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",
        "The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar.

        "Used my Groupon for a massage and blow out. Massage was very relaxing. Shampoo and style were ok. Stylist was a little slow to style my hair, as he was using a blow dryer that wasn't very powerful. Overall a pleasant experience. Friendly staff and central location. I will book a repeat appointment.",
        "The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \\n\\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.",
        "The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\\n\\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \\n\\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations.",
        "Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at BC today. The food and service was wonderful. My guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was. It's always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this.",
        "Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.  These people are thieves.",
        "Meh.  Had the filet and it was a little bland.  My salmon was very fishy.",
        "We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a clean neat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at $5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip.",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",
        "As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.",
        "Didn't live up to the hype.  My steak was OK, but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone.  We tried the arugula salad, heirloom tomatoes, asparagus along with the filet and chicken.  Steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal.",
        "Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.",
        "We love going to Tivoli Village. We've been performing there for a few years now and every time they have been very gracious. We have our Camp Rocks! Summer Music Day Camp concert there this Friday, June 20th, at 6pm. We have 7 talented kids who will rock the stage after only 2 weeks together as a group. The concert is free and open to the public.",
        "It's a nice place and pretty close to the the Jarry Metro\\n\\nNot too cramped for a Tuesday Night, very nice for having a group of people together.\\n\\nThe beer selection is very nice as well, having several Montrealer Microbrews. Had one of the stronger Ales (which tasted more like a Lambic than an Ale, but I digress) and it was a nice choice (though I'd describe it as slightly spicy)",
        "love this place! very friendly and did a great job on my nails. I came here with my mother and wife and we were all taken care of very well.\\neven though I was suckered in to coming here the owners were funny and made it easy to relax.",
        "What's your time worth?  Dollar doesn't think its worth much.  It's 11:30pm, over 40 families are editing in line ... With three (3) agents to serve.  It's a gross display of ignorance & arrogance!  I can't ever imagine renting from Dollar EVER!  You shouldn't either.  Lesson learned.",
        "This so bad! My husband and I walked in ordered a beer, hot tea and nachos without beans. 20 minutes later we get the nachos with beans so my husband asked if we could get them without from a different server because our server went on break. The manager came over and was so rude and blamed everyone else for the mistake. Because of the management I would never go back. He yelled at the bartender for trying to help us with our order!",
        "The service is very very slow. The server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17, WTF. The food was cold, no other server or manager came to help her out. I finally had to complain after 1 1/2 hours to the manager. I will never go here again.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "I bought a Groupon for a one-hour massage. I had a choice between a therapeutic, acupressure, and Swedish. Since I don't like to be petted and am super ticklish, I went for a therapeutic one. Stephanie was amazing. She did a great job loosing up the knots I have in my shoulder area and she stretched me well too. I am very happy with the service I received. I would definitely recommend this place!",
        "Some of the best hot subs in Vegas.  No matter what you decide on it's always the way you want it.  The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before.",
        "HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \\n\\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \\n\\nThe music, however, was cool.",
        "I was recommended to go to Wright's by a friend of mine and I wanted to take the time to post a glowing review because the service was beyond my expectations. Tom and the rest of his staff are not only highly qualified, they are friendly, honest and very accommodating. If you are looking for a great mechanic, look no further!",
        "I would never go anywhere else in the area, I have tried the one by Fry's, Safeway, and on Grand.. None of them are as nice and knowledgable as this group of people. Great job Do My Nails!  Almost forgot their new spa chairs, amazing to say the least.",
        "First visit and very impressed.  Excellent quality and personable service. Clean, modern interior. An excellent addition to Henderson. Both owners took the time to come by our table and introduce themselves and ask how we liked the food.  Good portions and the quality is obvious.  We will be back many times.  Check this one out!",
        "Lots of options at good prices.  More creative menu offerings then, let's say, Denny's.  I also love the Wednesday free pie promotion.  I've had the Fresh Fruit & Chicken Salad and the Southwest Salad.  The salads were large and filling and the ingredients were fresh.  I've also had the tomato basil soup and it was all right but a little on the oily side.  Service is friendly and welcoming.",
        "One word: OVERRATED\\n\\nThe pizza was subpar. Ive had much better for the price.\\n\\nMy group was smart and made a reservation, i really didnt enjoy the dirty looks and comments we got from some of the line that had been waiting (for what im still not sure) when we went in ahead of them.\\n\\nI really wasnt impressed.",
        "We ended up only staying about 30 minutes or so.  It's pretty crowded on Saturday nights.  They have a pretty nice patio.  Seems like a fun place to hang out with a group of friends.",
        "The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.",
        "We negotiated drink specials for a group of 30 + and they reneged when we arrived.  Best of all the manager was not able to talk to us because he was too busy. Yeah, too busy because we just tripled the occupancy of your bar.  Also,  we asked to put on espn and we were told it would take 10 minutes to change the channel.  Haha!  Probably not a bad place to visit if its not crowded, which should not be a problem.",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease. After one rather difficult appointment, Dr. Rapp called the next day to check on my daughter and make sure she was feeling well.",
        "Open late. Not too expensive by Vegas standards. Usually no wait. Inside our hotel.\\nWe ate here too much during our stay because it was so convenient.\\nThe food was ok. The service was good. Calm atmosphere. \\nI'd eat here again, but mostly because it's quick when my blood sugar is low.",
        "They were so extremely helpful. I had a million questions about my hair and wigs  vs my hair and extensions and she was very informative!",
        "Got a Groupon so decided to try Mind Over Batter. Have had Caketini often as it is at the mall and I think Mind Over Batter is the winner. Loved the Lemon Raspberry. Shop was cute and service was fast and freindly. I get the cupcake is the new hot item in desserts right now...but without a groupon I would not pay full price.",
        "Cute store but so tiny plus they seem so overpriced for what they sell.  I enjoy the display but after going in Charming Charlie its hard to be willing to overpay for similar items and purses etc.",
        "The Rio is a relatively nice place. It's comfortable, and the property is large with good amenities. Pool area is good. Staff is friendly. Why 3 stars?? Although the property is nice, there are some repair needs that seem to be blatantly avoided. Management should step up and put in some repairs and updates to make this place competitive with the newer hotels.",
        "This is tthe second time we've tried Nacho Daddy's (each time we used a Groupon). The 1st time a was about 6 months ago and it wasn't too bad, the portions were large and the service was satisfactory. Unfortunately, this time the portions were smaller and the combo plate was no where near as good as Roberto's or Fausto's. Overall it was sort of sucky, I would have been upset if we had paid full price.",
        "Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience.",
        "Andrea is professional and efficient--as painless as a wax can be.  It's easy to set an appointment with her and she is always quick to respond to my texts.  I've been going to her for over a year and think her service is great. Pricing is reasonable and oftentimes you can get a groupon!   I highly recommend her to others.",
        "Nice venue, comfortable seats.  It was funny, not side splitting. There were more \\\"games\\\" that the group did, and not a lot based in audience suggestion. I would have appreciated the \\\"improv\\\" more if there was more of it. Much of what was done could have easily been performed previously and passed off as \\\"improv\\\". \\nIt was nice to experience something different, and it is good to see more options for entertainment in Charlotte.",
        "I have never felt so welcome and comfortable at a dentist office. The scheduling was efficient and they had all my insurance information ready as soon as I walked in. The office is all digital so I didn't have to fill out any paperwork. The doctor is nice and very gentle. Everyone has a great personality and really makes it easy to go to the dentist. I have recommended all my friends and family and they have all been satisfied with them. Great place!",
        "This place is the shit!!! Especially when you can walk across the street! Welcome to the neighborhood!",
        "clean and friendly. What else can you say...\\n\\nI diddd buy some filet mignon that was at a price that made the food even better ;j\\n\\nR\\\\_",
        "What a horrible experience-had an emergency and needed to cancel my reservation more than 48 hours in advance...got the total runaround, talked to a bunch of people I couldn't understand only to be told no cancellations except 72 hours in advance.  Beware, do not book because you might have an emergency and hilton grand Elara is too big to care.",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",
        "Cool dive bar and a nice break from the normal las vegas scene.  Went in a friday night after getting free beer coupons handed to us on fremont street.\\n\\nWas pretty empty for weekend night.  Bartenders are as advertised.  Extremely loud with the megaphones bordering on obnoxious.  Fun though.  Be aware though bartenders will bait you into buying shots including for them and then your bill skyrockets.  Didnt think that was cool.",
        "$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "Our group got food poisoning from eating here. The service was great, but we got so sick afterwards we can never come back. \\n\\nStay AWAY! there are many other options for eating in the Venetian",
        "Service was uninsprired.  So many options at so many interesting and exciting places in Vegas . . . does not seem possible.\\n\\nWe were with a group of guys with big plans for the evening.  We had to stand-up, find servers to get them to come to the table to bring us more drinks.\\n\\nFood was very good.\\n\\nLike the viewing grill.\\n\\nRoom is tired.",
        "\\u00c9vitez ce resto le dimanche si vous \\u00eates un groupe de 6 ou plus. Minimum 90 minutes d'attente :( mauvaise gestion des tables.",
        "Is this a big convenience store or a very small market? It is not priced like a convenience store and does not have that atmosphere. Overall it does not have the friendliness of a small store. Selection and pricing is okay. It is all self checkout and it can be truly frustrating Self checkout anywhere else is not regularly annoying. Some employees are cold and employees make or break a small store.",
        "The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try.",
        "Just finished a wonderful dinner here!  Never had Turkish food before.  Will be coming back soon!  The Kuru Fasulye a white bean and chopped lamb dish was delightful.   The Lentil soup was velvety smooth and seasoned perfectly.   Turkish baklava is softer and chewier than most others, not overly sweet.  MUST have the Turkish coffee with it!   Awesome.   Staff was friendly and welcoming.   I highly recommend it.  Like a mini Mediterranean vaca!",
        "A very warm and welcoming feeling from the time you walk in till the time you leave   Mayo takes the time to really understand how you feel and does a great job making you feel much better when you leave  If you've been wanting to try Acupuncture, this is the place to go",
        "Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. \\n\\nI'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.",
        "Came here in the afternoon got super lucky and got 2 front row seats  in front of the wave pool !!!  drinks are (Duh! expensive ) @ $15 each \\n\\nLoved the sun and sand  !!!\\n\\n-1 star for having to pay for the tubes ( $25 ) for the lazy river.....",
        "Me and my wife enjoyed it very much!We got the Groupon and it was worth it.Very good food and nice atmosphere .We will be back for sure.",
        "I love this Home Depot. As a supervisor here transferring in from another store all the associates are friendly and very welcoming.  This team is great. I'm glad to be part of the team... As for any of you shoppers.. Please feel free to seek me out here if you need any assistance!!!",
        "I highly recommend trusting your locks to Rodney's care! I came to him after several salons over processed and bleached my hair to the point of breakage. The problem was that I always was forced to choose between white bleached hair or borderline orange... Rodney fixed all that, gave me a beautiful cut and color, and brought my hair back to life. With him you will get consistently beautiful results, not to mention amazing service, every time!",
        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.",
        "Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.",
        "Went a while back for my birthday with four friends.... Great place for group because you can try more items.  So we tried virtually every app, the egg was the best and fries were okay when compared to the egg.  Elk ribs were outstanding and grits below I still dream about.  Wine was plentiful. Desserts were good but over shadowed by the rest of the meals highlights!",
        "Rude welcoming by owner. Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon \\\"what do u need\\\". Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service",
        "I just threw up the morning after we ate at Gordon Ramsey pub and grill I ordered the salmon which was the worst thing I have ever eaten in my life. The waiter never asked us how our food was and there is no condiments on the table not even salt honestly I want to puke right now thinking about it for someone who critiques food for a living critique your own food",
        "Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague",
        "I really liked it. Loved the cupcake variety. Food was fresh, kept hot, pleasant experience. There will be lines no matter what time you go. Staff is polite and attentive. Went here on a groupon- good wine and beer choices.",
        "I have eaten there about 5 times. The food was good, service was good also. The atmosphere is a family type, a little bit of noise, but not annoying. So all in all it was good for me and my family. It seems to be a good place to have a large group go for dinner and not have a 2 hr. wait.",
        "The \\\"lil bit o salmon\\\" is off the chain! Hearty and delicious! Service is always welcoming and the desserts are awesome! I hate that it gets so crowded at lunch - but thats what happens when you serve up solid food for decent prices!\\n\\nYou have to try this place, definitely a hidden gem in Tempe!"

        "I love thai food but I'm not a big fan of the flavors from this restaurant. The pad thai tasted very different from any pad thai I had before, and I always try the pad thai at any thai restaurant. The panang curry was very soupy, again a very different flavor and kind of bland. The service is great but unfortunately the food not so good in my opinion.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "My cousin and I went to this place together and she was not a fan of it. If she could rate it from 1-500 she said, she would rate it 500- but it's a negative. It wasn't my cup of tea either.\\nNote that the wallpaper is hideous and their decorations consist of chili peppers dangling from the wall.",
        "If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.",
        "Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.",
        "The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).",
        "Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.",
        "I was in need of gas and I kept passing places that just seemed too expensive (in the NW area), I don't live on the NW side of town so I was unsure of where to go. Luckily this station was much cheaper and convenient to where I was going. I will use this place for gas if I'm in the area in need of a fill up again.",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.

The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.",

        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "Had a wonderful meal here. The scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings. The Veal Loin was about as perfect as humanly possible. The Nutella Bombs were a nice sweet finish. All was helped by a polished professional waiter.",
        "The 4 star rating is not for the pizza alone (which is pretty good, not the best I have ever had but still very very decent, especially the white)... but rather for the \\\"secret\\\" factor, the location and just the fun it involves getting there, also the Cosmo is one of my favorite casinos on the strip.",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",

        "This was the 2nd place we went to try and sell old gold pieces we no longer wear. What a difference in knowledge and costumer service we received going here. The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "My mom gets a bigger kick out of this place than I do. It seemed to specialize in upholstery, and the walls are lined with swatches. I did like that the woman allowed me to take mini-swatches off of the wall, but I didn't wind up finding any fabrics that worked for my projects. I'll definitely try back here.",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",

When I was there, there was only one employee in the place (Noon on a Thursday). And they had no customers. The guy was nice, took my order and cooked it up. Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.",
        "Delicious! Small hole in the wall, slow service but owned and operated by the cutest little couple! Your in for a treat here!",
        "This store is like a Mega store. Maybe they are a little bit over they head because sadly the meats are not the best. They have meat on sale for 3 and 4 bucks and its coloring is brown to black. Meat should be Red. I will shop here but I will stay away from the meat. If you can get pass that the store is really ok.",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back.",
        "Took my boyfriend for his bday.  He looooooved it. :) SCORE!!!  it was his first time at CDS and he can't wait to see others.  Suggestion: know the storyline/theme beforehand. it helps. :)  worth the money so see it! :)",
        "Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety.",
        "Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",
        "Very nice owner. Did handgun transfer at the store. Also score a Colt Python during transfer. Will definitely buy again.",
        "Place is alright but clearly it does not have the character if the rest of the southside.   I am a fan of Hofbrauhaus and Claddahs in here though.  Shopping is tired and the movie theatre is so so.",
        "This place is pretty secluded. If you don't know the neighborhood you'd probably never find it. Luckily I was on a food tour. Its a small convenient store with beer, wine, and other random goodies like yellow stone ground grits (yes I bought some). It has a deli counter and you can create your own sandwich. The owners are pretty cool people too! Look it up and stop in!",
        "i love this place because it's similiar to our Yummy's back home. the food is sooooo good! i always get the kalbi and meat jun combo. but i can never decide on the side veggies you get to choose, as i want all of them. i highly recommend this place! i consider it my hole-in-wall place.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",
        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Yum! A BBQ place right down the street.\\nBad news first....Dickey's is tiny. I thought it might be take-out only when we first walked in the back. The only other nip is the ordering is a little weird especially if you're not six foot tall.\\nThat being said....the 'q was very good. I'll be back.",
        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "If I could give this place 0 stars I would, that is how bad the food was. It seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn. I didn't think it was humanly possible, but I have finally found a buffet worse than Hometown Buffet. Good job Circus Circus.",
        "I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!",
        "Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said \\\"Need a ...\\\" but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online.",
        "This is a fun staple in Pittsburgh where the locals and university students alike come to dine. $10 bottles of wine is an attraction as is the fried fish sandwiches. They have delicious fish sandwiches!",
        "The yogurt is very creamy and good but they're slacking on the toppings compared to Zoyo. But I mainly gave Orange Leaf a lower rating because the staff are not friendly. I sometimes go just because it's close and it's a little cheaper than the other froyo joints.",
        "HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \\n\\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \\n\\nThe music, however, was cool.",
        "Why is this place so fantastic?\\nI don't even know. What a great addition to the scene.\\n\\nI am from Pittsburgh but now live in NYC and the bagel I had here this morning could rival a NYC bagel.\\n\\nSupport your local businesses, folks. This place is TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!",
        "Gigantic tourist trap, but I suppose it's fun for the kids. Pretty much M&M logos plastered on every item imaginable, but the wall of M&Ms is pretty impressive. If you only want a few candies, get them somewhere else, as waiting in the lines to check out can take a while, and $12.99/lb for M&Ms isn't a great deal. Good to go to at least once, I suppose.",
        "Turns out the bug infested part was BED BUGS by the way!  Yes that's right BED BUGS!",
        "Love me some Yogurtology! Great selection of flavors, most of which are Gluten-free for my darling Celiac boy. They also have the toppings segregated from each other and very clearly labeled. So my seven year old had no trouble distinguishing which ones were safe for him to pile on. We all got different flavors but the stand out was chocolate/coconut swirl. It was divine like a frozen Mounds bar. Worth every penny!",
        "I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had, but still very good.  I had a cheeseburger with mushrooms and bacon.  The bun was unfortunately too small for the patty and the top portion of the bun was rock hard.  The burger was extremely large and cooked very well.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food was out immediately.",
        "Average customer service,  average sandwich making skills, average speed. Hence average rating.",
        "No idea how this place gets such high ratings. Service is terrible, slow, uninformative, no follow up, not good.  Food was average.",
        "This is tthe second time we've tried Nacho Daddy's (each time we used a Groupon). The 1st time a was about 6 months ago and it wasn't too bad, the portions were large and the service was satisfactory. Unfortunately, this time the portions were smaller and the combo plate was no where near as good as Roberto's or Fausto's. Overall it was sort of sucky, I would have been upset if we had paid full price.",
        "Food here was pretty good.  I would have given it a higher rating if the service hadn't sucked so bad.  Hot fries were good but not overly spicy.  The wings had good flavor but not too crispy.  The wife ordered pizza and it was awesome.  The cheese sticks were also good.  It took us over 30 minutes just to pay after we finished our meal and our drinks ran empty a few times.  I would come back but just for the food.",
        "Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\\n\\n\\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00.",
        "It's not a bad hotel, just dont expect too much from it. I was actually surprised that it's so quiet in the rooms even though the casino is right outside the door.  The AC unit doesn't get very cold (might of just been my room), beds are pretty comfortable. My only real complaint would be that the curtains don't cover the window completely, so the morning sun is right in my face, though nothing a pillow fort can't handle!",
        "Hole in the wall exterior. Parking lot is super small. Don't let that discourage though!! The food is worth it! Our First time here we found the quality of the food rivals Peruvian restaurants in Sonoma and New York. The recipes are spot on. Even the seafood was great. Will definitely be back again and again. No lunch menu so be prepared to share or go home with leftovers.",
        "It's okay.  The room was clean and the bed was comfy.  The staff was friendly and the food was good and affordable.\\n\\nIt's a bit old and the rooms are stuffy.  I hated walking through the lobby with everyone smoking.  It's pretty far down the strip.\\n\\nNot the worst place I've ever stayed, and it was reasonably priced ($69/night).",
        "Sadly, I will have to take this location off my option list.  I will stick with the Sahara or Fashion Show location.  So convenient to my work place but after three days in less then a week of stopping by for some treats only to be greeted with a closed venue I am going to have to give up.  I'm just not down for making another wasted trip.",
        "Poor service, lack of cleanliness, and unbelievably bad food.. A one star is too high of a rating! No second chance deserved here - no way we will be back.",
        "$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us.",
        "Simply the best steak sandwich in pittsburgh! The meat is amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. The gentleman working the counter even offered to come around to explain all the chef's homemade sauces to us. I will be back again and again!",
        "Great drinks and beer selection. Also a great bar to watch games at. Unfortunately the night I went, the bartenders were very rude and cold. It took them ten minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink, when the bar was half empty. When I asked about the specialty drinks the bartender rolled her eyes and vaguely explained to me what the smoke stack drink was. All in all cool bar, bad service.",
        "One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere.",
        "The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try.",
        "Nove was an interesting Italian place.  At the top of the Palms, I was expecting a bit more for the price.  Our meal was very expensive and unfortunately, I did not like what I ordered.  The server said the Seafood Spaghetti was their signature dish and honestly, I would be embarrassed if this were my restaurants signature dish.  Nove was a decent experience but I will probably not return.  I really wanted to love this place, but I just didn't.",

The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10.",
        "Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\\\" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.\\nI don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre.",
        "Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game.",
        "Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.",
        "An absolutely unhesistant 5 stars. Best culinary experience I had in Pittsburgh and ranks up there among my best meals ever.\\n\\nLots of playing with textures, incredibly fresh ingredients, interesting flavour combinations, this place has it all. There were a lot of asian influences in the menu items and the chef leans towards more simple, elegant flavours that highlight the freshness of the ingredients.\\n\\nI loved every bite.",

        "Didn't have a chance to try it unfortunately. We waited around twenty minutes at our table and no one came to take our order but there were five servers standing around chatting at the front so we left!  Keep in mind I've worked as a server for over five years",
        "For me, this is heaven. \\n\\nI love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display. It truly makes me happy. The very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back. It's a glorious oasis of size 4's just waiting for me to come by and pluck them, like ripened grapes from the vine :) Delightful!",
        "I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact.",
        "Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \\\"orange chicken\\\" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting.",
        "The restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group. The salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful.

        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",

        "Their Iced Mocha is really good.  I'm not to big on the bagels. That's the only reason I took off a star, everything from service to drinks is awesome!!!",
        "As a bar it's pretty decent. As for the food well... If you're going to prepare ALL your food in a microwave, can you at least hide it somewhere in the back. I would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos.",
        "The food was outstanding, as were the drinks. The decor is simple, but cool. Service was top notch. Worth the price tag!",
        "This place is amazing I love their pho dac biet and the rice dice with grilled pork and fried eggs on top.",
        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",
        "This place is as bad to be expected! \\n\\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \\n\\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!",
        "This place is always busy but one can get seated pretty fast. The food is always heat. HOWEVER the service was surprisingly bad. What I order is none of the server's business. If I want to order something big then take most of it home, that is MY business not hers to comment on",
        "Sadly, I will have to take this location off my option list.  I will stick with the Sahara or Fashion Show location.  So convenient to my work place but after three days in less then a week of stopping by for some treats only to be greeted with a closed venue I am going to have to give up.  I'm just not down for making another wasted trip.",
        "Disgusted. TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR CAR IF YOU GET YOUR CAR WASHED HERE. Left a ring in the ash tray of my car where i usually leave it while working out/hiking, with the cover closed ( yes, a mistake from the start ) STOLEN. Dumb enough to go back two weeks later to use the coupon booklet that i had purchased, this time all the silver change was stolen out of the ash tray and the pennies were left behind. Absolutely terrible.",
        "The deep dish pizza is good.  I prefer Oregano's sauce (which is spicier) but this sauce is probably more authentic.  The specialty pizza options were interesting.  I got takeout so could not comment on the service.  Overall I would not hesitate to return if I was in the area.",
        "Tried to make delivery over the phone, girl could not understand me when giving my address. I would give numbers, she would rearrange the numbers, get my apartment number confused with my street number. gave up and hung up.",
        "I go here at least 1 a week with my wife.  I get the meatball Pho along with the BBQ pork Bahn Mi.  The food is great, cheap, and quick.  The staff is friendly, not in your typically way, but they do a good job.  Da Vang has become of my favorite places period in Phoenix.",
        "closed for ever",
        "How does MetroPark inventory work?\\n\\nWhen we came in, we saw a sign that announced that the store was closing for good in two days. Is it then reasonable for one to expect really, really cheap prices? Perhaps if this was a \\\"normal\\\" store.\\n\\nI saw a cute dress that I really wanted up until I saw the $70 tag. Pass!",
        "Atmosphere pretty good.  Had the fish and chips, good portion and fresh cod. Had an early lunch so I can't comment about the atmosphere during busy time. Give this place a try, great location in downtown Chandler.",
        "We just randomly stopped for breakfast here.  It was really delicious! Julie was our server and she was really perfect.",
        "For being surrounded by two lakes, Madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water. Head down to McFarland and check out the beach house. It's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake. Tons of windows. Not a bad place.\\n\\nCan't comment on the food. Drink specials were solid.",
        "Great crepes...although it needs to open earlier and 7 days a week.  It seems that I have tried to go when it is closed as often as it is open.",
        "They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!",
        "Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options",
        "i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!",
        "We just had Robert ,from the Appliance doctor , to check my Dacor oven. I have NEVER had a repair service clinician so prompt, so polite and courteous ! And, gave me helpful tips on how to use my ovens... He went above and beyond!  Will definitely reccomend to family and friends!",
        "Food, great. Atmosphere, great. This place has a simple menu that can please everyone. The only thing I have to comment on is the service could use a little work... The bartender is solid, though. And sometimes the lighting makes me feel like I'm being interrogated (it's a little dark and creepy). Other than that, get the deviled eggs & pineapple bacon pizza",
        "Greeted promptly... Ron III, was great!  very patient while my 3 year old jumped from bed to bed; and even played hide and seek with him...all while talking about what my options were.",
        "Wish I could give 0 stars. I reached at 7:45 pm and the lady at the counter rudely said they are closed, even though the sign outside said Open and closing time is stated as  8pm. Terrible attitude, indifferent & callous, clueless about why people go to facilities like fast med.\\n\\nI had tried to get appointment through their site prior to the visit, but it was broken.",
        "Great coffee and snack selection.  They are friendly and efficient.  I usually end up here more than I expect because Einstein Bagels next door tends to let me down, so I walk right over here and they consistently great.",
        "Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \\\"help wanted\\\" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.",
        "This place is really cool--kind of gives the \\\"dinner on the dock\\\" feel of SF, but it's inexpensive and casual. There is no indoor seating, so mind the weather before you head out there. It's kind of hidden so make sure you read the directions on where to go!\\n\\nService is comparable to any other bar/sports bar kind of joint, and the laid back atmosphere is part of that.",
        "The \\\"lil bit o salmon\\\" is off the chain! Hearty and delicious! Service is always welcoming and the desserts are awesome! I hate that it gets so crowded at lunch - but thats what happens when you serve up solid food for decent prices!\\n\\nYou have to try this place, definitely a hidden gem in Tempe!",
        "Needed a Tux for prom because I'm a last minute guy and this place was perfect! Great, quick service. The guys here take the initiative to get anything you need or anything you want to change. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger \\\"I'll be back\\\"",
        "Great coffee. Free refills just keep your receipt. Hazelnut coffee?! with more hazelnut? I'm in heaven. I also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine. LOL. The bagels here are also worth the price.",
        "Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila... The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back.",
        "This place always has very long lines, even at the self checkout stations. On top of that several of the checkout stations are always closed. I can understand being too cheap to keep the checkout lines adequately staffed, but closing self checkout lines while customers are spending several minutes in line just seems malicious.",
        "Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.",
        "Having come from LA with a large Vietnamese community, this is not the same Bahn Mi I'm accustomed to. Heck they couldn't even make a decent vegetarian. \\n\\nI will commend them on their clean facilities and quick service however. Oh but if you're an attractive young lady expect some disrespect from the male staff.",
        "Drove all the way here and they are closed for maintenance until end of May. I just wish that businesses that are on yelp would make us aware of these types of things, bc now I have a bad taste in my mouth...",
        "The price tag for the Jimmy Dean Delights turkey sausage bagels said $5.99.  After I got home, I looked at the receipt and noticed I was charged $7.19.  Thanks for the false pricing, Target.  I think that's illegal, too.\\n\\nI'm going to think Twice before I go back to Target.  Might go ahead and close my Red Card too.  Not worth the 5% discount to get overcharged.",
        "Not a good cab company to take to the airport.  Even when booking in advance they will not give any notice if they can not make the requested pickup time.  Calling dispatch after no cab arrived was very unsatisfying, they stated that the pickup time is just an estimate window give or take 20min. and that I should have planned accordingly. What? Thanks for nothing.",
        "We found this place based on an ad online for $2 off a smoothie. It was hot like hell so we stopped by. We got 2 smoothie and they only took $2 off. We asked about it the girl said she did not know and gave an awkward smile. False advertising. I do not like dishonest business.",
        "I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great.  I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here.",
        "The only record store in Vegas left that I will shop at now that Big B's Cds & Records - CLOSED!",
        "GO TO THE BARRELHOUSE!  I've been there a few times and they always have great food and service. It's in a very random strip mall, but perhaps that helps to keep the prices reasonable. Great drinks!! Don't hesitate!",
        "Ordered the sampler set! 1oz of sample for 5 beers cost about $5. Much cheaper than most brew pub.\\n\\nThere are 4 regular variety of beer + 1 seasonal brew. All the beer are good. The ales are smooth, with a hint of sweetness in the after taste. \\n\\nI did not order food here except chips and salsa, so I cannot comment on the food/prices.",
        "This place closed down. Now it is a Thai Basil.",
        "Do not shop at this location.  My wife and I went in last Saturday made our purchase and set up delivery for today. I just called the store to find out that not only are our goods not coming today our delivery was rescheduled to next Saturday without any notice.  I will be canceling my order and never shopping here again.",
        "Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer.",
        "The food here was alright, not the best I've had, but the service my family got was absolutely horrible! They were extremely rude and very UN attentive. The portions also weren't too big. Will only come back if all the other pho places in AZ are closed..",
        "Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check.",
        "We came here for a Monday brunch.  Nothing special.  Although the place was not crowded at 11:30 am, it took us 1/2 hour for us to get our order.  No points there, food was average.  Although we did notice 4 people playing beer pong at the backside of the restaurant.  Our waitress was friendly but seemed elsewhere.",
        "A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it."

        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",

        "Was walking around the Paris Casino and came upon a bar thatwas hopping to find out their were dueling piano players. So we decided to take a listien for a few songs and wound up staying there for several hours. Anybody who can pull off Motorhead's \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" is great in my book. They were extremely funny and kept you interested and having fun all night!",

        "One of my absolute favorite places in Vegas! Such a great piano bar and so completely underrated. The bartenders have some of the best voices I've ever heard (Specifically Dre- Amazing voice!!!) great entertainment and a must visit if you are in Fremont St",
        "This restaurant is terrible the taste of The foods are awful and they serve with lack of utensils and the worst is the drinks comes in a styro foam cup . I will never recommend this restaurant at all.",
        "I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.",
        "I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "I loved the atmosphere and food.. Yummy..",
        "Super awesome event. They managed to cater to my veggie needs. The set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the Moscatohad to be the strongest ever. We loved it, the first two dishes win the others no so much. One person said they could see they're reflection in the cheese!!!  Yikes",
        "I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.",
        "Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",

        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "\\\"Hipster,Trendy\\\" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude.

        "Everything was AWSOME. I got the famous chicken and waffles with a Bloody Mary. I was so stuffed after half of this giant portion but I just couldn't stop eating and forced myself to keep going. Prices were reasonable compared to most places around. I will return and would recommend to anyone.",
        "Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly.",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "Great service, love the Gyro and Athens Fries",
        "Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.",
        "My first time here and I will be back! I was craving mad Greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews. Far better than the mad Greek! It tastes so fresh and if you're like me and enjoy REAL food you'll love this place. Just look at the picture",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",

        "Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.",
        "We loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff.  Get the free headsets to learn more details.  It had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art.  We saw some new (just new to us) techniques and mediums like casein paint, egg tempera, etc. Very nice little gift shop.",

        "Loved it.  Perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings.  Very fast service for a busy place.  Better than the place at Hilldale.",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",

Yummy!",

Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.",

        "This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price.",

We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!",
        "I just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here. Both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time. I took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong. You would think Dunkin Donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves.",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",

        "Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.\\nWe didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. \\nBut I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs.",
        "I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now.",
        "I originally came for the pizza, which is excellent, but I keep coming back for the Italian dishes. O am glad I went out on a limb one night and ordered something other than the great pizza.

        "Always has been a favorite! The management and staff have always been great and do whatever to keep you happy! There is not one bad food item on the menu and everything tastes so good it makes it hard to decide. Their Buffalo Mac and cheese is great, also a fan of their pretzel too. Also all the beer options will keep anyone satisfied.",
        "Great location with easy access to monorail, express bus, and bridges to cross busy streets. Good staff and lobby experience. Hotel rooms are very large but the reason for three stars: out-dated tube tvs that have poor reception on half the channels, and a bathtub-shower door combination that is ancient. But I loved the value and the access to Paris Las Vegas and its delectable restaurants. Nice pool.",
        "Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.",

Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large.

        "I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.",
        "OK, so this place is not favorable. I do not want to incite any horror sensations. But this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days. Skip this place if you'er craving Thai, go elsewhere.",

I will not crave for it next time.",

You will NOT be disapointed.",

I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "This restaurant is about as first class as it gets.  The food and service were just spectacular and the ambiance quite romantic.  It's a very good place for a nice dinner for two with your spouse more than anything, although I saw all kinds of people there. The menu is a bit pricey and everything is a la carte, so be prepared for a big check.  I loved the whiskey menu, quite extensive.",

I really enjoy sportsmans and the products they offer. I sincerely hope that things get better with their staff.",
        "I have been to this place about three times over the last couple years. I always loved the blueberry pancakes each time I went, but I was disappointed this time around.   The food was just okay.  The waiter was very friendly and kept up with our pace of being served (fairly quickly).  We used a Groupon, so it was still a good deal and will go back again.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",

I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",

Don't waste your money!",

        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",

The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. \\n\\nOh well, onto the next burger joint.",
        "This show is pretty incredible and yes, gravity defying, but if you have seen the traveling Cirque shows it may leave you wanting more. The production value and moving stage is something to be seen, and if you can, do. I just thought the show was more choreography than acrobatics. The shifting, ever evolving stage on hydraulic shafts? AMAZING. whoever thought of that should get a medal.",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",

I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",

Besides that service was nice and great and they even offered to exchange it for something else.",
        "The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.",

I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.

Its hard not to find something you will like.",

It's a far drive, but from the many salon location near where I live I will defiantly take the time to go to this location. My main core in a salon is cleanness and customer service. Kathy was very friendly and knowledgeable about the product along with providing me clear answer to all my question. I would recommend making appointment as they seem to have consistent customer.",

The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together.

I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.",

        "The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\\n\\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",
        "Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.",
        "Love the milk tea boba drinks here! They have a variety of tea selections. Great place to hang and relax in the late night. Great staff and customer service. I am starting to sample the other drinks and the staff can help make suggestion and explain what are the different drinks they offer.  I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",
        "It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!\\nOk to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it.",
        "Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average.  There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland.  I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food.  Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back.",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "OKAY so im not a big fan of this place,but everything else is soo far from me. I will say though I do enjoy the carne asada fries hold the pico. I also love grabbing some cucumbers and radishes mix in some lime and salt and BAM awesome snack!",
        "Pretty good, though I like Thai Rama more. I wouldn't order any of the soups vegetarian as they are entirely too sour, but with chicken they are pretty good. The broth could use more depth in flavor in general. Ordered Spicy Thai Shrimp noodle dish. Everything looked grey on the plate- not very appetizing, but it tasted good. Curry is pretty good as well. All in all, it's good, but not my favorite.",
        "Went here with my boyfriend he got a pedicure and I got a fill with gel. They both turned out great. My boyfriends calluses were horrible and he left with baby feet they went the extra mile to make sure his feet were smooth.  Bella did a great job with my french tips very clean looking.   It's nice to have somewhere open past 7. \\n\\nBe sure to call and make an appointment though to make sure you don't have to wait.",
        "Not the best place to go, but not the worse. The music was on point throughout the night, nothing but the latest in Hip-Hop and House music. The bartenders by the main dance floor sucked, but the the others in the side-room were awesome! If your looking for somewhere to get your grind on, def put this on your list. But make sure to uncheck service and cleanliness.",
        "They do not reinforce the curbing, they walk into your backyard at 6am unannounced and almost get shot. They rip up your stake markers for other projects. No one speaks understandable English. There contact at the office had an excuse for everything. Glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed. If you want to waste your time and money use these guys! Otherwise find a good company.",

Decided to take my daughter to check it out we got there at 9:29 pm and it looked like they were closing,  the open sign was shut off and the screens were down.

        "I had the Hawaiian hot dog, small fry and small drink. My order came to $10 and some change. I was shocked when I was given the total for my order. It's crazy to be charged $10 for what I ordered. The fries were too salty. \\n\\nThe garbage can that I used was filthy. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks. Disgusting.",

        "They fill this place in past max capacity where it literally is like walking on top of another person just to get anywhere. Even to get back in from outside you have to wait in another line because they have to wait for people to exit first. These people need to be more about customer service instead of money hungry thieves.",
        "Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \\\"happy hour\\\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table.

        "Biggest rip off ever!! I had gotten an estimate from them to do a brake service and replacement on my vehicle and after my jaw dropped from the extravagant price they called me to reduce the original estimate they had given me by three thousand dollars!!!!

We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around.",
        "Smoothie King is like a broke Jamba Juice! When I came here it was packed with loads of people and the staff here are far from good customer service. The way it is set up makes no sense what so ever. When it was time to pay the guy ringing us up got our order wrong and wanted me to $18.00 for two smoothies..overall smoothies were good but don't think i would go back ever again.",

        "My daughter and I went last Sunday for lunch. We were seated in about 10 minutes so that was good however, that was the beginning of the end. After 15 minutes I had to get the attention of the busboy and asked him if he could be sure we weren't forgotten.  About 5 minutes later the busboy brought water and said the server was coming. NOT!  We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin.",

Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.",
        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states.

        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",

And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",

        "The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!",
        "This store is like a Mega store. Maybe they are a little bit over they head because sadly the meats are not the best. They have meat on sale for 3 and 4 bucks and its coloring is brown to black. Meat should be Red. I will shop here but I will stay away from the meat. If you can get pass that the store is really ok.",
        "I've now eaten here 3 times. 2 out of the 3, our order was taken correctly, the kitchen made the wrong order. The last time, they even made the reorder wrong. Food is decent and priced fairly. you won't be blown away by anything",
        "I was trapped across the street at the God awful RnR bar. I was longing to be there instead. It looked like a fun friendly place from across the road and the few bikers that crossed the road to check out RnR were good guys. I just feel odd without  a bike going there.",
        "I went here to use a Groupon and had a couple of beers and a burger.  Right off the bat the bartender mispronounced Smithwicks.  Not a great sign.  The beer was cold and the service was friendly so I really can't complain.  Good neighborhood place in Southern Highlands.\\n\\nThe burger was an average bar burger, but was large enough to take half home for later.  If I lived closer I would go back for sure.",
        "I absolutely love Ace stores.  It's a clean store, they are very friendly, helpful and usually have what I need.  The one time they didn't, they researched it (rare item, didn't even find one for sale on the internet) and got back to me in a timely manner.  They weren't able to find the item; but, they found a much more affordable alternative!  :-)  That's worth 5 stars in my book!",
        "OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\\n\\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\\n\\nRun away -",
        "This is my favorite Costco location. I'm in here so often I think the employees recognize me as a regular. Lol. I know the layout of the store, the employees here are professional and friendly. They often joke with me as I check out. It's not as crowded as the Hayden location and just FYI, gas here is always cheaper than the Hayden location too- significantly lower. A little secret that I'm sharing with you!",
        "Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \\n\\nOur dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \\n\\nBF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew.",
        "Excellent experience. Sharon upgraded my already upgraded room.  Next thing I knew, doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine.  Also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything I want along with $120 in breakfast certificate.  \\n\\nAll this is thanks to American Express card.",

I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water!!! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!\\nOk to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it."

        "Nothing to get excited about.  The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ).",
        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",
        "My daughter and I went last Sunday for lunch. We were seated in about 10 minutes so that was good however, that was the beginning of the end. After 15 minutes I had to get the attention of the busboy and asked him if he could be sure we weren't forgotten.  About 5 minutes later the busboy brought water and said the server was coming. NOT!  We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin.",
        "This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.",
        "No star would be better, horrible customer service in the \\\"SERVICE\\\" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Great service! No wait, actually owned by Pamela's! The food was great-- maybe even better than next door! All sorts of Yiddish references and fun Jewish foods that are hard to find elsewhere. Love the challah French toast. Highly recommended!!",
        "Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "The waiting is too long!! They should expand their patio , offer a complementary drink if you wait is more then an hour ! Who waits an hour to go out to eat! This is the reason i dont come here. She wanted to come here!",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "One of my absolute favorite places in Vegas! Such a great piano bar and so completely underrated. The bartenders have some of the best voices I've ever heard (Specifically Dre- Amazing voice!!!) great entertainment and a must visit if you are in Fremont St",
        "This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it - share, the portion is HUUUUGEE.\\n\\nThis place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",
        "Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!",
        "If you want a pizza that's ready to pick up quickly this is not the place. Last 2 visits all I wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times I was told a 15-20 minute wait. Hot and ready?????? Obviously not. Staff isn't the nicest either",
        "Horrible crooks !!! These people are con artists and are now impersonating another moving company with good reviews to get clients ! Please file a complaint online with the attorney general if they have scammed you and damaged your items.",
        "We recently dined there while visiting family in Scotland.  The food was very mediocre.  I ordered the salmon. I took a couple of bites and knew it was NOT fresh. I called the waitress and told her.  She said she would tell the chef. They did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it. I became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish. Not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse.  We would never go there again!",
        "I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \\n\\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear.",
        "Customers are good. That's all.",
        "The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \\\"no chocolate shake.\\\" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!",
        "This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",
        "Highly recommend this place, ask for Lily, she's very good and friendly service, good masseur, she even fed me mint candy! wow",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "Great little family bakery with great pastry and juices.  The owners are so nice and passionate about what they do.  Can't wait to come back.  Really love their empanadas.",

        "\\\"Hipster,Trendy\\\" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude.

        "I had given up on West Elm, I had put them in the same category as Ikea until I walked into this location.  I have been to West Elm in Denver, San Diego, and in Virginia, but this location has the perfect store design and employees.  If you like West Elm you'll love this location.  If you've give up on West Elm, I suggest you give it one last try and visit this store.",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly.",
        "Charlie is really friendly. If you introduce yourself, he will call you by name everytime you come back. The food is all really tasty. I'm partial to the house chili, but everything I've had there has been good. I think it's kind of healthy. I know it's inexpensive. And all the hot dishes come out piping hot, which is reassuring from a food safety perspective. You have to wonder about that aspect at competing restaurants.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "I've seen first hand the work and quality Puddle Jumper Pool Service has performed and it's top notch! Why go with a corporation and be just another dollar bill when you can have great personal attention from a family owned and run business?! Give them a call, you won't be sorry!",

Place was completely empty besides me then this security guard walked in and they offered him a sample but not me. Wanted to order a soup but was completely ignored then this lady who didn't understand English came out and couldn't help me at all so I left frustrated. With no food or tea!",

        "Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\\n\\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed.",
        "Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",
        "Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.",
        "This caf\\u00e9, conveniently situated opposite McGill, is a very good addition to the downtown scene. The coffee is excellent, and the owner Jason and his colleagues provide friendly service. The pastries, which come from a small bakery in the east end, are delicious (think muffins like mother used to make). I drop in as often as I can.",
        "We loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff.  Get the free headsets to learn more details.  It had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art.  We saw some new (just new to us) techniques and mediums like casein paint, egg tempera, etc. Very nice little gift shop.",

        "Specialising in mussels, oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we weren't disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains. Yummy. Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken. However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didn't have to wait too long.",
        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service.",
        "The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice.",
        "Food was okay it earned the 2 stars. The wait staff is horrible. Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for napkins and I had to walk up my cup for a refill.",
        "Never again! This place is gross. Dirty stained sheets, windows that don't open, bathrooms with no locks! \\n\\nStayed here for 4 days.. housekeeping NEVER ONCE CAME. Why don't you care?! :(\\n\\n\\nOh, they give AAA discounts but you need to tell them before you book..",
        "My first time going to this spa and I love it! The customer service exceeded my expectation. It's a far drive, but from the many salon location near where I live I will defiantly take the time to go to this location. My main core in a salon is cleanness and customer service. Kathy was very friendly and knowledgeable about the product along with providing me clear answer to all my question. I would recommend making appointment as they seem to have consistent customer.",
        "Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!",
        "Love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store!",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special.",
        "Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time.",

        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",
        "I've been to Venues Cafe twice - once for Sunday brunch and another time for lunch.  The outside seating area is beautiful.  I sat outside both times.  The food is excellent and I found the service to be awesome.  They were very attentive, never needed to ask for anything as they were at the table checking in very often.",
        "Good hotel for the price. Huge rooms. Everything is stained but to be expected by the strip. Bring your own everything. They don't even provide shampoo. Overall good FOR THE PRICE.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)",
        "I seriously love this place! I feel like 90% of my wardrobe is from here and whenever I get compliments I automatically send them here. The only thing I wish is that they would get in more smaller sizes when they order shipments because a lot of the time the smaller sizes are sold out. But other than that I love everything about this place!",
        "DONT EVER GO TO THE SPA GUYS! As I was leaving I was approached by 2 security guards accusing me from two other guests that I was acting aggressively. I was upset and also uncomfortable. In the end I then proceeded to tell the security guards this is the last time I will come here. I told them that I felt very uncomfortable over accusations that were not true. DON'T EVER GO TO THE SPA AT LEXWORD MEN YOU MAY GET STOPPED BY SECURITY AND BE ACCUSED!",
        "I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business.",
        "Gave this place a shot because my friends are always raving about it. The hostess was friendly. We sat at the only two open seats at the bar. No greeting or anything so we left after about 8 minutes of awkward waiting. To their defense it was extremely busy. Maybe I'll give it another try when it's not so slammed..",

The service is not as good as either Indulge, Zinburger or The Grind, and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods.  The food is very consistent; parking can be a bit difficult.",

        "The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \\\"MANAGERS\\\" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit.",

After 15 minutes I had to get the attention of the busboy and asked him if he could be sure we weren't forgotten.  About 5 minutes later the busboy brought water and said the server was coming. NOT!  We left after another 15 minutes passed and went to Red Robin.",
        "This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.",
        "It's convenient if you're staying at Gold Coast Hotel....they have cheap & good dimsum in there!  \\n\\nThe only downside...service is slow if you're gonna order from the menu or waiting for your check...server takes a while before you can get there attention.",

        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!",
        "It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",

The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",

The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \\nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open.",
        "Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint , clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. \\n\\nOh well, onto the next burger joint.",
        "If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\\nI don't mess with meat there",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",

It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone..",

So we said we would just try it since it was in Green valley casino which is down the street from me. When we got there the atmosphere was nice live singer but not what we were looking for. \\nI also felt like something was biting me when I was sitting on the couches.",
        "I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich.",
        "I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.",
        "Like the food but what is it about this location and the music. Always way too loud. The staff is friendly but don't go here expecting to be able to chat with the people you are having lunch with. Some days it's like being at a Nine Inch Nails concert.",
        "The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "They have a good variety on the menu, from oven wood oven baked pizza's to Osso Bucco.  Try the Mamma meatball slider to start!  Went on a saturday night, it was busy, so i can get noisy.",
        "Very nice and new hotel.  It is a bit away from the strip, so either bring a good pair of walking shoes, or extra money for cab fare. However, being a little distance from the strip can be a good thing, because it's quiet.  For the price, I would stay there again.",
        "The casino and hotel are dive city.  The area is sketchy and the hotel seems to lack security.  The casino itself is tiny and smells like an ashtray.  I kept it at 2*, because the slots are loose and the bar was friendly.  Will I go back, I don't think so.",
        "Cheap prices.great food..noodle dishes are what you order here",
        "This post is from my last trip to Las Vegas. It was supposed to be \\\"No Meat March,\\\" but obviously it didn't turn out that way. When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",
        "Solid, huge hotel.  Our room was in the updated \\\"west wing,\\\" which gets you modern-styled amenities and a small, porthole-like window.\\n\\nLots of dining and lounging choices, with a massive casino and sports book to boot.  There's not much to dislike here, a genuine Vegas Strip experience.  Very convenient, obviously, if you're in town for an event at the arena.",

        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",

        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",

Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\\n\\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's.",
        "Great lunch specials and service was great. Will be back.",
        "I am giving this place a three stars because I dine at a lot of Thai restaurants. The quality of the food is good, but it is overprice for the portion that you receive. This is however typical when it is located on the upper scale side of town. \\n\\nHowever, it does not have me going for more unless I am in the area and feel like eating Thai food. Even then, I would probably go to Bangkok Ocha!",
        "The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "Don't order the fried pickles :/  If they weren't free with the yelp check-in offer then I would've complained.  Everything else was just so-so, but I guess not terribly bad for a hotel resort joint.  The ice cream sundae was tasty at least :P",
        "Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \\\"Yum\\\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great!

        "Alway a very good lunch...make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal!  Opa!",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",

The food is excellent and I found the service to be awesome.  They were very attentive, never needed to ask for anything as they were at the table checking in very often.",

        "This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les \\u00c9clusiers should be a blip on your radar.",

        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.\\nMy Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.\\nFriendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.\\nExtra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!",
        "this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.",
        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,",
        "I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now.",

Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \\n\\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.",
        "Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",
        "Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.",
        "Food was pretty good. The power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 90-95 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable. The manager said \\\"we can't control Nevada power.\\\" Creamed spinach was no good. Lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  The steak just ok.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",

The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned....I'll stick to yelping restaurants.",

Be sure to tip the Valets and any other Service personnel.  They exist  to make your visit more fun.",

        "Great selection of beers from a variety of micro-breweries. We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "Aaron you have awesome customer service skills and also to the brunette bar tender!  You guys are awesome although the nacho's was a feat that crushed my confidence because of the large portion i will be sure to bring backup next time. Made a few friends too gregg and mariam from cali and mark from nm! Hope you see this hit this place up with a good review!",

        "First visit and very impressed.  Excellent quality and personable service. Clean, modern interior. An excellent addition to Henderson. Both owners took the time to come by our table and introduce themselves and ask how we liked the food.  Good portions and the quality is obvious.  We will be back many times.  Check this one out!",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",

Ive had much better for the price.\\n\\nMy group was smart and made a reservation, i really didnt enjoy the dirty looks and comments we got from some of the line that had been waiting (for what im still not sure) when we went in ahead of them.\\n\\nI really wasnt impressed.",
        "Why didn't I go to Kmart?  Filthy bathroom, already been hit up for money.  Total lack of customer service.  In fact I like to call their customer service department, Lack of Customer Service.  The works always looked over worked and annoyed to have to answer a question or help.  I mean the nerve of me!",
        "Scott said everything that needs to be said, except that yes, I can find clothes in my size, the men's department is ALWAYS neat and orderly (in fact the whole store is like that!) unlike the other place I recently commented on, and prices are at least \\\"not outrageous\\\".",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "I love the huge beer selection, cheap yet delicious food. It's great! \\n\\nMy favorites are the beef stew, the daily mussels special!\\n\\nHowever.. I must say the wait is LONGGGGGGGG for food, so don't ever come here on an empty stomach! And, it is definitely not a place for chatting, you get deaf after a while from the shouting!",
        "Favorite spot for a quick sandwich.  Salads are fresh and healthy and sandwiches are the perfect comfort food.  Husband and I go twice a month.\\n\\n9 times out of 10 the employees are friendly and quick to help.  Once in a blue moon, the teenagers are a tiny bit cranky but that has never affected my meal! \\n\\nMust try- spinach salad and Gobbler sandwich.",
        "The manager there was rude and had no personality. I would suggest reevaluating him as he is the reason we will not be returning. \\n\\nMy husband is an avid fish keeper and was excited that a fish store opened close to home. The store is nice, but expensive and poor quality fish. There was a  tank full of fish with ich. They were still trying to sell it rather than separating and trying heal them. \\n\\nToo bad.",
        "It's okay.  The room was clean and the bed was comfy.  The staff was friendly and the food was good and affordable.\\n\\nIt's a bit old and the rooms are stuffy.  I hated walking through the lobby with everyone smoking.  It's pretty far down the strip.\\n\\nNot the worst place I've ever stayed, and it was reasonably priced ($69/night).",
        "We had their special Tomahawk steak $98, Glazed Sea Bass $39, sides with asparagus $14, and hand cut fries $12. We don't eat our food bland, in fact slightly on the salty side, but all the food here was just a bit too salty. It will definitely spike your blood pressure. The best part of this experience was the ambiance. Definitely chic and their bathroom is really different.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.",

        "Overpriced for a hot dog, but you do get a huge ass wiener.\\n\\nI'm a girl that craves nacho cheese after midnight, so the Mojave Dog was the hot dog of choice and boy did it hit the spot.  \\n\\nI'm glad they were open at 2AM  and I didn't have to go looking for a 7-11.  :)",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "Big puddle in the floor on the to go side waited 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready ten minutes ago. Finally left after being ignored by staff. Will not be returning.",
        "This place sucks..\\nTook way to long to  get our food",
        "It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!",
        "Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \\\"Yum\\\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",
        "This location is alright. Most of the staff members are actually quite nice, and they've made my many experiences here enjoyable and easy. I just wish they had just as much items as Costco :( Other than that, this place is alright. It can get crowded a little and sometimes not a lot of check out places are open, so lines are long. \\n\\nI'd still shop around here, since it's the nearest location.",
        "Specialising in mussels, oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we weren't disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains. Yummy. Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken. However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didn't have to wait too long.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "I may not be back like previously stated.\\n\\nThe last two times I got take out food, the chips tasted like they had been cooked in rancid oil and the salsa was waaay too salty. It pains me to say this place has really gone downhill from what it once was. I haven't been back in a long time.",
        "I'll be short here.........Ummm NO.  As most people quote, yah the decor is nice...Well guess who's paying for that?  The consumer hence the overpriced drinks...Guess the concept works its always packed...",
        "I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar.\\n\\n\\n You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.",
        "The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the\\nPrice, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!\\nI would not go there again for sure!",
        "I was not impressed. The cover was $30 for ladies and $40 for guys. Seriously? I don't have a problem paying cover, but $30 is excessive. I ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the Luxor instead.",
        "I love this place! the food is amazing and everything is just delicious! the wait is a bit long, but its worth the wait.",
        "Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.",
        "I love this place! They have great gas prices and friendly staff. The lines are long but they go quick. The baggers are extremely helpful and always go above and beyond.",
        "I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",
        "I just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here. Both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time. I took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong. You would think Dunkin Donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves.",
        "We got there late at 9 am.  Such A LONG line, but there were tons of tables so I don't understand.  Waited thirty minutes and left.  It was 11/11/13 .  I'll use open table next time.",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \\nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "Loved it! Ordered my virgin daiquiri in a mini-blender (I'm pregnant) and was a happy girl! Bartender was very friendly and made sure that no one took my seat since I was pregnant and couldn't stand long. Will definitley go back!",
        "Seriously?!?  You really don't want me to spend my money here... Ok...  the most od aweful service I have ever received in a retail store in my life.   They literally turned a few hundred dollars worth of sales I was about to make out the door.  I will NEVER go back here again.",
        "I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!",
        "What's the point of opening until midnight when vendors are closing left and right and others are out of specials! What are we paying for?",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "My wife and I are late 30s-early 40s and did not find him particularly funny nor talented.  We went for free on fillaseat.com, and ended up leaving about 30 minutes in.  Sure, there were a few funny bits, but overall his impersonations were not very good, and his jokes were not very funny.  Skip this one.",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",
        "The food is absolutely spectacular. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. The only reason I leave off one star is because some of the waitresses aren't spectacular. I also get very annoyed with picking up food. The hostess will tell me 15 minutes and it will take longer than 30. I even leave late expecting the long wait and will still have to sit around for a few minutes for it. Every once in a while they forget the miso soup too.",
        "Went for a Birthday party in a large group,  we had the private dining room booked.  Great quality food, a little expensive but i guess its true you get what you pay for.  Had Prawn Tempura starter and Chicken Pad Thai main course.  All very well done and presented.",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "Took over 10 min in the drive thru. ..1st time at this location.   The woman who took my order would not let me finish speaking long enough to get understand my order... get it together DD...",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "Everyone else enjoyed it, so I guess I'm on my own.  It was just OK.  It went too long for my tastes, so my friend and I ditched out after an hour and change.  I think it was close to over, but we had seen enough lip syncing for a night.",
        "Tried the clubhouse burger.  YUCK,  the flavors don't blend, the bun tasted weird, too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich, long story short didn't like.  Gave it a thumbs down to manager, who seemed un interested when I told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased.",
        "Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.",
        "We were visiting the area and were able to make a last minute appointment on a Sunday! Our dog was treated royally.  The grooming was fantastic but even better was the attitude of the people there. They were great with our dog and made us feel like long-time friends.",
        "I went here many years ago and thinking that it was really impressive.  My latest trip has taken a 5 star review down to 3.  There really is nothing extraordinary about this buffet, other than the fact that it is in the Paris hotel.  The buffet is not really long either!  I remember there being a lot of fishy foods, which I could careless for.  The wait line on a Sunday evening was 1 hour!  It is NOT worth the wait!",
        "Biggest rip off ever!! I had gotten an estimate from them to do a brake service and replacement on my vehicle and after my jaw dropped from the extravagant price they called me to reduce the original estimate they had given me by three thousand dollars!!!! Do they think I am an idiot!!! I will never do and business with this dealership. I will surely not ever buy an overpriced car from them either.",
        "Nolia serves upscale Southern cuisine, and my dinner there was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The pork was tender and the sweet potatoes were perfect. Nolia, in an historic house in Elizabeth, reminded me of Charleston, SC. The fancy, but friendly atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. That location has seen many restaurants. I hope Nolia lasts.",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Dude, LAX sucks.  It's like a hallway packed with sweaty old men, plus a balcony with more sweaty old men staring down.\\n\\nThey have absolutely no line system.  That just packs everyone into the \\\"waiting area\\\" until someone pushes and shoves their way through the entrance and slips the bouncer a twenty.\\n\\nI know it's Vegas and I have to lower my standards, but LAX just sucks donkey balls.  Sweaty ones.  Gross.",
        "Wackness defined. Twenty bucks for food that makes T.G.I.Friday's look like it deserves a Michelin star. Even for an airport this place is overpriced and not worth a stop. The service was decent, but that was the only redeeming quality whatsoever about this place. Avoid.",
        "This airline sucks! I booked travel in September and paid main cabin select.  They changed planes so my seats where changed. This is not the first time it happen years ago on Virgin Atlantic. I called them on it today as I went to log in and it nothing but lip service.  Total crap and now to move up they want even more money.  After this trip no more.   I have better service from Southwest then these guys.",
        "uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \\n\\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.",
        "love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.",
        "I just called the Rolfs Salon at Gainey Village, what happened to Delores Leiva? Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.",
        "Great place to shop at, a lot of different stores to choose from.  Parking is fairly easy, especially when it's not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days.",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "A little tiny tiny place with a huge huge line (get there early or late).  Make sure to sign in on their waiting list as soon as you get there. Ramen=Mmmmmmm~\\nMy bf and I didn't care much for the miso ramen but others were excellente~ :)  We'll definitely going back for more when we get a chance to visit LV.",
        "Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying.",
        "Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line...",
        "I have not been to the dentist in a long time.  I recently went to Downtown Dental.  Everyone was very friendly; the hygienist, the dentist, and the receptionist.\\n\\nThe office is very nice, clean, and very conveniently located.  I showed up about 5 minutes early and was greeted and seen without a wait.  I will definitely be going back.",
        "Service has been horrible all 3 times we have been here.  The food is ok, but overpriced!  Not a bad place to drink as long as you don't drink fast!",
        "Stand up guys. Scott took care of me and didn't pressure me into any repairs. He was kind enough to quote the needed repairs and offered to just do the bare minimum (safely of course) to get me back on the road.  I'll be referring friends to this shop so long as they are in business.",
        "Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day.",
        "These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.",
        "I love Ross and I love a bargain, but why is this particular location almost always half empty? The racks look so sad! I try to check this place out often and it's always the same: half empty racks. This isn't the best Ross location in town so don't make a special trip to shop here. As with every Ross, checkout lines are ridiculously long.",
        "If you need to use a fax machine, this is your place to go. I've only been here several times for ink and to use their fax machine. Their back to school sales are pretty awesome, so i usually only shop here during late summer/early fall.",
        "We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a long weekend and I ended up at Border Grill a couple times.  The 4 stars are really for the weekend brunch - all you can eat tapas that were interesting and (mostly) tasty.  I went back for the margaritas later which were also tasty though not particularly cheap.  You'd think the upstairs patio would be a good place to watch the beach concerts but the waiter said it was too dark to see the stage. Alas.",
        "This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "Love the dark bar look of this sushi place, among other things ;). They are consistent with the quality of food and service. Lunch time is usually hectic and it can sometimes take long. The staff is so helpful and know their menu. They have great, fresh sushi and reasonable prices. \\n\\nTry the edamame, seaweed salad and the Professor Vu.",
        "Not a good place to go. Worst service. Waiting times. After waiting  one hour and forty five minutes food arrives but no more drinks.  to bad this is a new location not planing to go back any time soon ...",
        "Denny's with more parking than the one on the strip. Service is still horrible, a standard Denny's signature service marker. Nothing else really different, other than the fact that you're in Las Vegas and probably need to sober up before your long drive home. It gets the job done as you would expect.",
        "Never again....I have tried this place twice now.  First time was a NYE party and now just to hang out and gamble.  Each time sucked!  I got suckered into bottle service for 500 bones and now just dropped 100 bucks at keno.  What a complete waste of time.  Also, why didn't anyone tell me there was a freakin loer yuppie convention in town???",
        "Horrible atmosphere, waiters left dirty dishes on one of the three islands/pantry in the middle of the restaurant. (Which is weird enough....that you can see opened very cans of soda and cut up lime and lemons that have been sitting out for who knows how long). Horrible service. Horrible attitude waiters. Would never go back. I am surprised that this chain has not been shut down.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Haven't eaten here in over a decade but was hella impressed with the eggs benedict sandwhich. Wait was a little long.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "I love the huge beer selection, cheap yet delicious food. It's great! \\n\\nMy favorites are the beef stew, the daily mussels special!\\n\\nHowever.. I must say the wait is LONGGGGGGGG for food, so don't ever come here on an empty stomach! And, it is definitely not a place for chatting, you get deaf after a while from the shouting!",
        "This place always has a long ass line. I don't understand it. I wish they could improve their service somehow.",
        "Btreakfast was good. Not great, but good. we did eat there 3 times for breakfast last week while in vegas. However, Tuesday night is seafood night and I would not recommend it. very poor buffet for dinner, especially when my mother came back to the tabel and told me she saw a guy about twenty something years old touching the food with his hands. beware!",
        "Awesome beer selection, ok latkes, and surprisingly great coffee. When I wake up a little early, this is my first stop on the way to work.",
        "We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back.",
        "It was okay.  Can't compare to Ike's sandwich.  I had the pastrami rueben, very disappointed... Not even two layers of meat.   My sandwich was sad, which made this visit and experience sad.  Line was long and wait after ordering was long, you would think that the long wait meant good food, but it was completely opposite.\\n\\nA second visit would require me to be completely wasted.",
        "Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! \\n. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's."

I would recommend to anyone who wants to adopt new pets, vaccinate, and spay or neuter current pets. You can even get a tour of the place. Really cool and caring staff. Thanks for everything Animal Foundation.",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",
        "This restaurant is everything I love about Phoenix. It combines San Francisco sophistication with San Antonio humulity, and even features Mrs. Myers delightful brew in the bathrooms. Folks, if you can only have one nice dinner in Arizona this is the place. I would give one bonus star for their amazing lunch specials, if I only could.",
        "No star would be better, horrible customer service in the \\\"SERVICE\\\" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Waiting for the connection flight, I decided to get a beer. I found the Home Turf Bar, which was right next to my gate.\\n\\nI wasn't hungry and just wanted a quick beer before my flight. They had Shocktop, which is okay with me. It was an okay place to pass the time before it was time to move on.",
        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "Pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below.  Pomo in Scottsdale is better and closer.  Probably won't go back. \\n\\nThe staff were not friendly and it wasn't even that busy - we went last night.  To much success has gone to there heads.",
        "I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",
        "After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives i thought I would try it out.  The Pig Dip is the signature dish and it was everything I thought it would be.  Edgy atmosphere and complimentary valet parking made it convenient. \\n\\nService was average and the valet driver was not afraid to hit the gas and squeal the tires on my Tundra.\\n\\nGo for the food, you won't be disappointed.",
        "Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!",
        "This was my second time here, the first time I had it, the cheeseburger was sooooo good, but this time it wasn't so great.",
        "It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "My cousin and I went to this place together and she was not a fan of it. If she could rate it from 1-500 she said, she would rate it 500- but it's a negative. It wasn't my cup of tea either.\\nNote that the wallpaper is hideous and their decorations consist of chili peppers dangling from the wall.",
        "We recently dined there while visiting family in Scotland.  The food was very mediocre.  I ordered the salmon. I took a couple of bites and knew it was NOT fresh. I called the waitress and told her.  She said she would tell the chef. They did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it. I became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish. Not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse.  We would never go there again!",
        "If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",
        "Got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious. I thought it was actually pretty big for a small, but would be good for sharing. Also got a thai iced tea with boba. The boba has great consistency and tastes just right.",
        "Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.",
        "This place is the worst,  they deserve NO STARS but Yelp wouldn't allow that. Terrible service,  bad food. DON'T GO!!!",
        "Classic sports bar...great bar food (wings are the bomb!!), service is good for food type...it's not a steak house people!!!! Love coming here with friends to have a drink, play pool or shuffle board, and catch up with sports. Fun happy hour specials...come check it out!",
        "Service was incredible.  We were a group of seven and all were pleased with the food and service provided.  We would all definitely recommend and return.",
        "I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "Service is good.. Food is terrible. Low quality, bad preparation....  If the quality to price was more in line I would've given it a higher rating because I don't generally have high expectations for chains but in this case I just don't think the value is there.",
        "I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.",
        "The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).",
        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Had lunch here with some people from work and as always its great.  The service was a little slow, but what isnt in Vegas.  \\nI had the Grilled Shrimp Salad with a extra shrimp.  It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone..",
        "No longer has hookah :( A friend of mine wanted to go to chill at a hookah lounge we tried calling before we went but didn't get an answer.  So we said we would just try it since it was in Green valley casino which is down the street from me. When we got there the atmosphere was nice live singer but not what we were looking for. \\nI also felt like something was biting me when I was sitting on the couches.",
        "One of my favorite omlettes of all time. Solid cup of coffee, good ambiance, and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store. Great breakfast place, be sure to stop in!",
        "Good food, crowded, hurried service  (the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said \\\"you done\\\")",
        "This place blows. They never have shit & what little they do have is expensive. If it wasn't the ONLY place within walking distance I'd never come to this Shithole. They need to put an AM/PM or a QT around this motherfucker! At least the cashiers are nice.",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "I love this place for dinner.  A very nice variety.  Service has always been good for me and the portions are huge.    I would tend to stay away from seafood here though.  I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "Ordered food to go at 130 today and was told it would be ready at 202pm via email.... did not receive food until 245pm and was late for work because of it... also the employees were very rude and did not want to help me... thanks for letting me down and the bbq was just ok not great, will never go back!",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "Not impressed with my last visit. Pizza was not good and service wasn't either.",
        "Very nice and new hotel.  It is a bit away from the strip, so either bring a good pair of walking shoes, or extra money for cab fare. However, being a little distance from the strip can be a good thing, because it's quiet.  For the price, I would stay there again.",
        "Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.",
        "I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.",
        "I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.",
        "Everything was AWSOME. I got the famous chicken and waffles with a Bloody Mary. I was so stuffed after half of this giant portion but I just couldn't stop eating and forced myself to keep going. Prices were reasonable compared to most places around. I will return and would recommend to anyone.",
        "My husband said we got the worst pizza we ever ate there one night.  We tossed the soggy mess, and when i called back the next day the manager said i had waited too long to call and he wouldn't make it good",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",
        "Can i give this place zero stars?????  $85.00 for a \\\"Deluxe\\\" Pedicure and it was the worst, quickest, wambam thankyou mam pedicure.  Horrible!!!!!  They won't be getting another dime of my money.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.",
        "Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience.",
        "I'm not sure what your expecting for $16.99. I didn't mind it. I was on a diet when I ate here. It was doable but I did end up using all my calories at breakfast. Crazy, right? It was just average. It wasn't horrible. I've had horrible. It's just on the lower end for Las Vegas...or as the locals call it Vegas..or maybe they just say LV!",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.",
        "My friend kept saying: I have to get Nine's Gnocchi while we're here. Thankfully, I followed the leader.The Gnocchi with truffle cream was absolutely delicious! \\n\\nThe Broccoli Gratin was also tasty. And, the ambiance was the best: we got to watch girls line up to flirt with Pauly D. What a meal!",
        "Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!",
        "I don't remember what roll I ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top. \\nWe came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but I felt like we were rushed by the staff.",
        "Love this place! BEST AND COLDEST BEERS in Vegas! It is my (and my husband's) new favorite place to watch sports! And who doesn't love an AWESOME cold beer while watching your favorite sports team?! Their hot wings are great, hamburgers are super yummy, flavorful, and juicy. We've been here at least 3 times in the last week...especially since it's hockey playoff season! ;)",
        "My first time here and I will be back! I was craving mad Greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews. Far better than the mad Greek! It tastes so fresh and if you're like me and enjoy REAL food you'll love this place. Just look at the picture",
        "Had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues. Food was very good, service very good. Great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the \\\"courtyard\\\" outside the restaurant's entry.\\n\\nDefinitely would go again.",
        "I am giving this place a three stars because I dine at a lot of Thai restaurants. The quality of the food is good, but it is overprice for the portion that you receive. This is however typical when it is located on the upper scale side of town. \\n\\nHowever, it does not have me going for more unless I am in the area and feel like eating Thai food. Even then, I would probably go to Bangkok Ocha!",
        "I think the rooms need an update. I mean, for the price, they're not spectacular. Staff were really nice though.\\n\\nThe casino and bar/club/restaurant choices are fine, typical Las Vegas. \\n\\nThe lobby is gorgeous, but you don't have to stay there to see it!",
        "5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot.",
        "Don't order the fried pickles :/  If they weren't free with the yelp check-in offer then I would've complained.  Everything else was just so-so, but I guess not terribly bad for a hotel resort joint.  The ice cream sundae was tasty at least :P",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "Cant believe that this place got 4 and a half stars. Im asian and I have been driking a lot of bubble tea with tapioca from many places. This place has the worst tapioca that Ive ever tried. Who rates this place above 2 stars should go to california and try their tapioca over there.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "This location is alright. Most of the staff members are actually quite nice, and they've made my many experiences here enjoyable and easy. I just wish they had just as much items as Costco :( Other than that, this place is alright. It can get crowded a little and sometimes not a lot of check out places are open, so lines are long. \\n\\nI'd still shop around here, since it's the nearest location.",
        "On behalf of the Lil Saints 12U girls softball team, I would like to thank Zzeeks for their continued support of our girls throughout this season.

        "I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.",
        "I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\\n\\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!",
        "my friend and I tried two different tasting menu there. Generally it was good, but just felt a little bit over priced. I paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of Rose and tip, tax. If you never tried any modern mixture of French and Japanese cuisine, I would recommend it.",
        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",
        "Wifi doesn't work in many of the public areas!  You'd expect them to get it right.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "Heavenly!!!\\n\\nI was there last weekend and once again it was amazing. Wynn by is one of my favorite place to stay at in Vegas (Bellagio is the other). The staff is amazing, the hotel is amazing, the service is amazing, the food is amazing and the gambling is great. \\n\\nThank You",
        "Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food.",
        "Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "My first time going to this spa and I love it! The customer service exceeded my expectation. It's a far drive, but from the many salon location near where I live I will defiantly take the time to go to this location. My main core in a salon is cleanness and customer service. Kathy was very friendly and knowledgeable about the product along with providing me clear answer to all my question. I would recommend making appointment as they seem to have consistent customer.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "I go here to get my prescriptions, since it is close to where I live. The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together. Going to pick up my prescription always puts me in a bad mood because of the rudeness of the staff. I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.",
        "Cool place but there was one snobby blonde bartender who was totally just flat out ignoring the people next to us.  We decided to order for them because she would just not even acknowledge them.  I actually called her out on it and she gave me attitude, too bad she has such a terrible life that she has to let it show at work.  Other than that, the music is great, ambience is fun but laid back.  Small place but it's not too packed.",
        "This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \\nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!",
        "Conveniently located inside of Caesars Palace... However, they're not a part of the Total Rewards program that Caesars is a part of. \\n\\nWhy would this matter? Well, cause you can't claim your free birthday drink here! \\n\\nWhile not my personal favorite, it's not a bad bar to try...",
        "Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar.\\n\\n\\n You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the\\nPrice, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!\\nI would not go there again for sure!",
        "I love the Beef Pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw. I will be back once it's under 100\\u00b0 again - because seriously, soup in the summer just sucks.",
        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "Meh place, but it was the cheapest and best located decent hotel to stay.\\nIf you can afford it, try the newer hotels."

        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "Love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store!",
        "Had a wonderful meal here. The scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings. The Veal Loin was about as perfect as humanly possible. The Nutella Bombs were a nice sweet finish. All was helped by a polished professional waiter.",
        "The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar.

        "New Mexico Chile soup, salad and beer bread - yum! German sausage plate - yes! Chocolate paired with beer ( you can't leave without tasting the tri -pepper pairing), what's not to like? Pub food does not have to be greasy frat food. Thank you, Great Dane, for a fabulous lunch!",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",

I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "I love this place!! They have the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches around! Make sure to order it with the cheese whiz. Another good sandwich is the original hoagie. It has tons of meat on it!! This place is family run and they treat you like your part of the family.",
        "Great new location. I am excited they moved closer to us. Always the best sandwiches in Surprise.",
        "Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market.",
        "We had Andy as our waiter and he was great! Super helpful with my vegan options, made our night super fun and special. All the staff was very nice and food was just awesome. VEGAN options were fantastic! Drunken noodles was superb, vegan brownie sundae just lovely. Thanks Wazuzu and Steve Wynn for being vegan friendly!",
        "i freaking love this place! my phone broke, and they fixed it like nothing happened! i will definitely go to them when there is a problem with my phone again. thank you!",
        "Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food.",
        "My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning.",
        "Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \\nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.",

        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,",
        "I'm in town for an hour saw this place on line before we left Angel Fire.  Chef John Murphy is outstanding not only regarding the meal but in regards to excellent customer service as well. Enjoyed it immensity and will be back later this week. Thanks John! !!!",
        "Sensational! \\n\\nBruntsfield does it again! La Barantine serves up absolutely sensational sandwiches and their pastries, sublime. I had a pistachio macaroon and was blown away by its taste!\\n\\nOnly very small inside so if walking past and you see a free table inside, grab it!!!!",
        "Mike is one of the most honest mechanics I have met. I took my vehicle in to find out why it wouldn't start. He didn't repair anything, he found the problem and told me what to replace myself. Just had to pay the diagnosis fee. He will be getting more of my business in the future.",

        "This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again.",
        "The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \\\"gross\\\" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around.",
        "get rid of the fries on the sandwiches and put the toppings on that i ordered",
        "Food is Okay. Breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads and sandwiches were decent. Can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.",

        "My rescue Jagger is a Lab mix, and was scared of his own tail when I got him. After just the first few classes I noticed a big difference. Leah gave me lots of good tips to help him at home and when we go out. He is a brand new dog now I can walk right up to people without him trying to bolt. He really knows his commands now. Our training class has helped Jagger and I so much! Thank you Leah!",
        "Excellent experience. Sharon upgraded my already upgraded room.  Next thing I knew, doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine.  Also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything I want along with $120 in breakfast certificate.  \\n\\nAll this is thanks to American Express card.",
        "Love the milk tea boba drinks here! They have a variety of tea selections. Great place to hang and relax in the late night. Great staff and customer service. I am starting to sample the other drinks and the staff can help make suggestion and explain what are the different drinks they offer.  I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",
        "Food is good, service is bad.  Have been here twice...both times our order was screwed up.  The second time we received no apology.  Wait staff is reactive instead of proactive.  Food is decent but expect more for the money.  I really wanted to like this place but I have been given too many reasons to go elsewhere.",
        "Used to have to come here to pick up coffee for my lazy boss but after switching jobs realized I was right next door and have now been coming every day for nearly a year. \\n\\nWard and Monica are great. They will let you try stuff, explain coffee stuff, and recommend stuff. \\n\\nEveryone loves the kale but the stalker and squashed mango are my favorites.",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",
        "I would like to share my experience at Discount Tires on W Azure, got the best customer service from the time I pulled up up in my car from the time I left. It took them 30 minutes to get me back on the road, and I got a \\\"GREAT DEAL\\\" on my tires, feel like I am in a new car, I will recommend this location, great customer service, Thanks Rob your the best.",
        "I will give this place 5 stars, reason being is the contacted me to correct my mistake post. I did on the wrong Resturant. I appreciate owners that follow up\\nOn comments or customer experience. I do frequent vegas every couple months and I will  come here to eat, once again thank you for being understanding of my mistake. look forward to trying the Resturant out.",
        "Tried the clubhouse burger.  YUCK,  the flavors don't blend, the bun tasted weird, too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich, long story short didn't like.  Gave it a thumbs down to manager, who seemed un interested when I told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased.",
        "They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home.  The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake.  Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No.  Not even an apology.",
        "Lovely, quaint, and vintage are the adjectives that spring to mind for this delightful wedding venue (from a wedding guest's perspective). I'm pretty jealous of whoever used to live on this estate. The woman who works as the wedding organizer (not sure of her official title) was very friendly to me and helped me find a little emergency sewing kit for a last-minute dress snafu - thanks! A very pretty and romantic spot, all told.",
        "I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\\n\\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!",
        "I loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and I ate it two days in a row. This time I feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. I ordered 4 Earl's club sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -NADA! It also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. Eh I am officially sick of this place. I will not crave for it next time.",
        "Found this place on yelp and just want to stop by bcos my brows getting out of control. When I was getting two people ahead of me and the wait was les than 10 minutes. Did my eyebrows and lip for $9.00 that first time $5 deal applied to my service. Wow!! What great experience and now I know where to go. Thank you fabulous eyebrow threading.!!!",
        "The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\\n\\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \\n\\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations.",
        "Called around and no one could beat this places offer. Quick service and phone looks like brand new. Will go again if I have too (hope I don't have to). They have my business going forward with my products. Thanks and keep it up.",
        "Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at BC today. The food and service was wonderful. My guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was. It's always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this.",
        "Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.  These people are thieves.",
        "I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!",
        "1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.",
        "I have stayed at LVH twice previously with Hubby and had pretty good experiences, but last time we went, you can definitely feel the wear and tear. The tub was dripping all night, the elevators, hallway, and room looks worn and dated, and just gives an overall meh feel to the guests. Thanks LVH for the budget rooms for the past years, but I think I'll check into another hotel on the strip next time I'm in Vegas.",
        "On a bien manger .... Mais je m attender \\u00e0 plus peut \\u00eatre car on m en avez parler en bien c est bon le service et bien mais rien d extra :) mais je recommande quand m\\u00eame",
        "Wow.  Amazing food.  The portions were generous and the food amazing.  I recommend the short ribs, really big portions.  My wife got the shrimp and scallops but had them prepare it with olive oil and garlic to avoid the cream sauce (lactose intolerance) and it was delicious.  The beer selection is impressive, I recommend the Porter.  Live music gave it a great atmosphere.",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "A GREAT show...THANK YOU ASU Marching Band !!",
        "This place is great for Happy Hour. Otherwise, the prices are ridiculous. My friend and I arrived 10 minutes after Happy Hour ended and decide to forget that idea and go somewhere else.\\n\\nWhat I can say for the place even during non-Happy Hour times is that they have delicious (and STRONG) drinks. Also, the food is adequate. Certainly not terrible, but not enough to pay more than 10 bucks for a roll. Nope. Sorry.",
        "Decided to check this place out since we were in the area and there was a yelp deal. \\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing too special but it took forever for the server to bring our food and it wasn't hot when it arrived. After waiting forever we didnt' want to send it back to be reheated. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so the delay and luke warm food was a disappointment.",
        "Another great and honest service by Decatur Auto Electirc.  This is the 3rd time they have worked on my truck and have been resonable and honest each time.  Thank Luis and team for another job well done!  I will recomend you and be back with future issues I may encounter. Thanks, John",
        "We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.  When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.  Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.  Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "This is a fun staple in Pittsburgh where the locals and university students alike come to dine. $10 bottles of wine is an attraction as is the fried fish sandwiches. They have delicious fish sandwiches!",
        "I like their coffee and I am happy to support a locally owned establishment. Good product and fair prices. Thanks for opening it!",
        "Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there.",
        "Order the GFY burger.  You can thank me later.\\n\\nThis place is off the charts awesome.",
        "My favorite is your Gorgonzola bread & my husband loves the monterrey pepper jack with spicy tomato oil. I used DukesBread parsley oil to marinate chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill...they were fantastic!  I've also used it as a sauce over salmon.  You have consistently great products - many thanks! We will see you every Sat!",
        "Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative.",
        "First visit and very impressed.  Excellent quality and personable service. Clean, modern interior. An excellent addition to Henderson. Both owners took the time to come by our table and introduce themselves and ask how we liked the food.  Good portions and the quality is obvious.  We will be back many times.  Check this one out!",
        "Absolutely terrible!!! I waited for 20 minutes to even get soaked for my pedi and then after an hour had passed and no one came to attend to me I just asked for a towel and left. I can't believe I wasted an hour just sitting there soaking my feet expecting that the lady would come and work on my nails. Do no go here, period!",
        "One word: OVERRATED\\n\\nThe pizza was subpar. Ive had much better for the price.\\n\\nMy group was smart and made a reservation, i really didnt enjoy the dirty looks and comments we got from some of the line that had been waiting (for what im still not sure) when we went in ahead of them.\\n\\nI really wasnt impressed.",
        "Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.",
        "The drinks are awesome. While the food is pretty good, It adds up since they are small plates. Don't go there hungry, but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer. Always prepare for an hr wait.",
        "Service sucks sooooooo bad. I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out. Oh and by the way I told my waitress I've been waiting for 25 minutes---- she said ok. No apologies. Wow! Avoid it like a plague.",
        "We negotiated drink specials for a group of 30 + and they reneged when we arrived.  Best of all the manager was not able to talk to us because he was too busy. Yeah, too busy because we just tripled the occupancy of your bar.  Also,  we asked to put on espn and we were told it would take 10 minutes to change the channel.  Haha!  Probably not a bad place to visit if its not crowded, which should not be a problem.",
        "My husband and I love Flancer's!  We've tried several sandwiches and salads, as well as a few of the appetizers.  Everything has tasted great!  The service is good, the waitstaff friendly and they have tv's if you don't want to miss the game.  If you are looking for some good food, in a casual, relaxed atmosphere from a local business, then I would highly recommend this place.",
        "Favorite spot for a quick sandwich.  Salads are fresh and healthy and sandwiches are the perfect comfort food.  Husband and I go twice a month.\\n\\n9 times out of 10 the employees are friendly and quick to help.  Once in a blue moon, the teenagers are a tiny bit cranky but that has never affected my meal! \\n\\nMust try- spinach salad and Gobbler sandwich.",
        "As a bar it's pretty decent. As for the food well... If you're going to prepare ALL your food in a microwave, can you at least hide it somewhere in the back. I would also appreciate it if the waitresses could wash their hands in between handling money and preparing my nuke nachos.",
        "Went here for dinner. Place was empty. Table was sticky. Soda was not carbonated. Food took over 30 minutes to be served and everything ordered was only sandwiches and a burger. The waitress was nice but nothing else about the food was worth a second visit."

        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",

My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.

The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there..",
        "I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.",

I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",

        "Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working.

Even though I told her what I had. \\n\\nIt might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.",
        "They are awesome! Had my phone done in an hour! Great price too!",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",

        "I don't remember what roll I ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top. \\nWe came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but I felt like we were rushed by the staff.",
        "While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\\n\\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's.",
        "I think the rooms need an update. I mean, for the price, they're not spectacular. Staff were really nice though.\\n\\nThe casino and bar/club/restaurant choices are fine, typical Las Vegas. \\n\\nThe lobby is gorgeous, but you don't have to stay there to see it!",
        "Good food, fries are awesome but everything is so pricey.",
        "Don't order the fried pickles :/  If they weren't free with the yelp check-in offer then I would've complained.  Everything else was just so-so, but I guess not terribly bad for a hotel resort joint.  The ice cream sundae was tasty at least :P",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \\\"Yum\\\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",
        "I've been working out at CrossFit Max Effort for about a 3 days now and I love the place. Great Facility and very Knowledgeable Instructors. I like a family atmosphere and here that's what you get. Everbody wants you to succeed in all of your goals , its more than just a work out. CrossFit is not for everyone but if you wanna see what your made of start here.",
        "Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",
        "Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.",
        "This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.",
        "Big portions, good flavor, great prompt service, great price.  Pancakes  than IHOP, waffles better than Waffle House, French toast better than...making it yourself.  Will be back.",
        "Great staff and they never mess my hair up, perfect everytime, they so send out great coupons for an awesome cheap cut",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",
        "Good food. Girl is not too friendly  unless your Turkish.\\nSMALL portions LARGE PRICES! Not enough hummus or babagounish. Veggie platter price keeps going up with all the other prices. Really good food just skimpy on things and prices are very expensive for this kind of fast food.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food.",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again.",
        "The food is your standard, crappy Chili's food. However, as far as airport Chili's (and even regular Chili's) go, the staff here was the nicest and most efficient I've ever encountered. (Note: No alcohol is served anywhere in the Char airport before noon on Sundays.)",
        "Great place! I'm glad that we pull over here at a right place where we eat our dinner with a cool interior design that will add to your appetite.\\n\\nThe price is also cheaper than the others.\\n\\nCheck this out!",
        "Pretty good a bit pricey could be cleaner",
        "I was not impressed. The cover was $30 for ladies and $40 for guys. Seriously? I don't have a problem paying cover, but $30 is excessive. I ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the Luxor instead.",
        "Updating the review because the business offered to repair the phone again for a reduced price.  If the repair holds up to a couple of drops I will update again but for now, it's only been a week so who knows.  The prior repair broke again the very first time she dropped it with a screen protector and a phone case on!",
        "Had a little bit of most of the food. Everything we had was good at a good price. Service was good too. With the variety  of items no way your not going to get your money's worth.",
        "Good hotel for the price. Huge rooms. Everything is stained but to be expected by the strip. Bring your own everything. They don't even provide shampoo. Overall good FOR THE PRICE.",
        "This is an update to my previous post.  I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street.  MAJOR MISTAKE!  It was way over priced, crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance.  I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert.\\n\\n I'll never cheat on you again Rehab!",
        "I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business.",

The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.",

We suggest anyone else does as well.",

        "It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.",
        "This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price.",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning.",

        "Where to start. We went there on a Thursday night at 830. Our waiter was the worst waiter ever experienced. He was not attentive at all and was borderline rude to us the whole time we were there. The food was okay, but not excellent. The portions for the price are high even with this being Vegas. There are other places on the strip I would go to before ever go back to this place. Save your time and money!",
        "The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.",

        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.\\nWe didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. \\nBut I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs.",
        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "The lobster mac and cheese was terrible. I also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea. Won't come back for anything else. Located inside the Planet Hollywood.",

Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!",

Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!",

There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "Meh. Is about the perfect way to describe this place. First, it's too expensive (I know it's Vegas, on the Strip, but improve quality if you're going to have such high cost). Food was okay at best. With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one.",

The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",

Everyone was very friendly; the hygienist, the dentist, and the receptionist.\\n\\nThe office is very nice, clean, and very conveniently located.  I showed up about 5 minutes early and was greeted and seen without a wait.  I will definitely be going back.",
        "Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day.",
        "Another great and honest service by Decatur Auto Electirc.  This is the 3rd time they have worked on my truck and have been resonable and honest each time.  Thank Luis and team for another job well done!  I will recomend you and be back with future issues I may encounter. Thanks, John",
        "Love my gym!!! Working out!!!",
        "Great selection of beers from a variety of micro-breweries. We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)",
        "One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.",
        "I was recommended to go to Wright's by a friend of mine and I wanted to take the time to post a glowing review because the service was beyond my expectations. Tom and the rest of his staff are not only highly qualified, they are friendly, honest and very accommodating. If you are looking for a great mechanic, look no further!",
        "This is the worst sushi place ive ever been to in my life. Taste awful. service was so slow, one waitress, one sushi chef. will never ever go back or recommend this place.",
        "Inexplicably Whole foods switched out their baked goods supplier and now they don't have decent chocolate or almond croissants anymore.   Now I have to go to Panera bread, Starbucks or the local bakeries.   Bad move, I hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this.",
        "The food here is ok to good but varies a lot. Serving tables are set too hot as are the heat lamps so food that's fresh from the kitchen is better than stuff that's been sitting. Salad table is fine as are the deserts.  And in any case it's considerably better than what I've been eating in Beatty for the last two days.",
        "Stayed last weekend and did not enjoy. I am a Marriott Rewards member and have to say that I got better service staying at a Fairfield.  Room was not cleaned despite calling room service twice. Light switches in room did not work. Either all lights on or off. Elevator access with room key was a joke because it often did not work right. Never received bill portfolio thru email despite multiple calls. System not working and transferred to another number to leave a message. Would recommend not staying here.",
        "I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in. It's about time to scale back the number of clients and/or appointments you take. Look, I've even had enough time to write this review AFTER reading all the others.",
        "Not worth it. Some weird, offensive smell throughout entire hotel. Gym was packed constantly. Way more kids at resort than I expected.  \\nLobby and bar area, pretty. Golf prices, just too high.\\nHotel leaves a message at your  room saying \\\"come down and pick up your free gift\\\" but your free gift is really a ploy to get you to buy a timeshare. BRUTAL!",
        "In short...it was fantastic. I have access to many celebrity chef restaurants on the strip & Embers rates as high as any of them. Just delicious comfort food...and we left knowing there were many other menu items we would have ordered.\\n\\nA great locals spot. And very affordable.",
        "Terrible service. Everyone in our party was forced to order their own entre, even though some of them were not hungry. The entre come with nan. The waiter refused to substitute them with similar priced roti because \\\"the chef was unwilling\\\".",
        "Some stuff is cheaper. Other stuff is more expensive. I do like the deals at the deli. They have really good turkey and roast beef. They also give a 10% discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey. Love that they support the local team. Go cardinals!",
        "I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of. All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.  After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it. I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it.",
        "My favorite restaurant in North America. Every time we've been there we've been treated well and fed better. From the fois gras poutine to the duck in a can, and everything else, it's just cool.  And if you're lucky, Chef Picard will be there. It's fun to watch him work.",
        "I have never felt so welcome and comfortable at a dentist office. The scheduling was efficient and they had all my insurance information ready as soon as I walked in. The office is all digital so I didn't have to fill out any paperwork. The doctor is nice and very gentle. Everyone has a great personality and really makes it easy to go to the dentist. I have recommended all my friends and family and they have all been satisfied with them. Great place!",
        "Wow...what an AWESOME company! Upon entering, I was greeted by another happy customer whose postcards came out so well...he was showing them off and gave me one. I was in awe at their artwork.\\nI'd went in regarding a charity i was raising funds for. Samantha quickly heard the cause and generously donated. I have found my place for my next car wrap!! Awesome!",
        "Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.",
        "Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.\\n\\nThought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe. It's been a rough morning. Needless to say, my therapist is not going to be happy about this.\\n\\nSee photos.",
        "So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!",
        "We moved here about a month ago, and so far everything has been good! All the staff members have been very kind and helpful. The complex is great, for us and our pets, and we are excited to start enjoying all the amenities that includes. Hope to keep having a wonderful stay here!",
        "If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction",
        "The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.",
        "Overall the food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Enoteca loses a star because when I asked for no onions on my pizza, the waiter said it would be rude to even ask because Chef Marco wants them in there. I countered that I didn't care and still didn't want the onions... of course the pizza was covered in onions when it arrived 15 minutes later.",
        "This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \\n\\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area.",
        "Simply the best steak sandwich in pittsburgh! The meat is amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. The gentleman working the counter even offered to come around to explain all the chef's homemade sauces to us. I will be back again and again!",
        "Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart.",
        "Definitely one of the finest properties in Las Vegas. The location is outstanding with great access to The Strip, McCarran, the highways and tons of other Vegas locales. The building and facilities are immaculate. The Valets, Concierge & security team are the ultimate professionals. We bought a unit as a vacation home in 2011 and its tranquil, safe and a fun place to getaway to.",
        "The equipment is well maintained and the place is always clean. The downside is a general lack of choices in the area so it's always crowded and it's often impossible to get a treadmill and have a routine on machines. I don't have a lot of time and this poses a bit of a problem. It's a good gym, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a friend.",
        "This traditionally is my last stop in Vegas.  I was so FULL from eating eating eating the entire week... but the Gelato was so refreshingly delicious!  I have never had it before because I have always had a hard time choosing that over the delicious looking pastries.  Best Part.. Jean Phillipe Maury was standing in the hall across from the Chocolate Fountain talking with another chef... no one knew it was him :)",
        "We couldn't get a table at Emeril Lagasse's place. So, we ended up here it was in the same hotel. The Oysters on the Half Shell and Tuna Tataki and Tartare was okay but pricey. For my main dish I had the Crispy Duck Breast. Pretty good it was a good thing I stay up the whole night after that dinner.",
        "We just had Robert ,from the Appliance doctor , to check my Dacor oven. I have NEVER had a repair service clinician so prompt, so polite and courteous ! And, gave me helpful tips on how to use my ovens... He went above and beyond!  Will definitely reccomend to family and friends!",
        "Stopped by Citizen today with my Dad. I frequented this spot a few times when it was Lola. Love that there are more pastries now and it was fun watching the new in-house baker do her thing behind the counter. The Hive with almond milk was the best non-dairy latte I've ever tasted! Dad gave his scone 5 stars. Great job! Looking forward to seeing what happens with this shop in the future.",
        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "I love this Home Depot. As a supervisor here transferring in from another store all the associates are friendly and very welcoming.  This team is great. I'm glad to be part of the team... As for any of you shoppers.. Please feel free to seek me out here if you need any assistance!!!",
        "I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE",
        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.",
        "I got the #11 pho with any desired topping to choose. The beef broth was good! The bowl was large and worth the $8.50! BUT I found 2 strands of hair in it!!!! And another 1 in my mouth.... I didn't want to tell the worker but I should've. The servers were nice and the food was good, so I felt bad if I complained to them.",
        "Not a worker in sight.  Had to ask for help twice before somebody finally came after 15 minutes.  Girl at checkout asked if i found everything ok.  I said no that Lowes only had one of three items i needed.  She only responded with a blank stare.  Poorly stocked also.  For example, 66 quart storage bins had no lids stocked.",
        "An absolutely unhesistant 5 stars. Best culinary experience I had in Pittsburgh and ranks up there among my best meals ever.\\n\\nLots of playing with textures, incredibly fresh ingredients, interesting flavour combinations, this place has it all. There were a lot of asian influences in the menu items and the chef leans towards more simple, elegant flavours that highlight the freshness of the ingredients.\\n\\nI loved every bite.",
        "Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.",
        "Always come for the breakfast buffet. I love the French toast and the fresh fruit. The waitresses are always nice to deal with. \\nBeing a club member you sometimes get deals in the mail for buy one get one free and that always makes it nice.\\nBreakfast is 8-10:30",
        "Worst Mexican food I've ever had and being from San Diego, I've sampled tons. The food is bland and the workers were constantly getting orders wrong.",
        "The restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group. The salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful. We had a variety of food: tacos, enchiladas and carne asada. Unfortunately the food was bland and not very good. Perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day.",
        "My husband and I split a farm burger and sweet potato fries and were completely full! The burger was delicious and the fries were really good as well! We even got to see Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina who is the head chef there now! It was very exciting since we are big fans of Ramsey and his shows!",
        "Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end! \\n\\nThe wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team",
        "Over Rated FOOD!!! This place needs a good chef.. I don't plan on dining here again.  Pasta is so cheap but why charge ridiculous amount of money?",
        "I broke my ankle and they wouldn't pay for a walking boot that the doctor confirmed was covered. we paid cash for it, because we didn't have a choice. every time we submitted for reimbursement, they gave a different reason why they wouldn't pay. After about 5 submissions, we gave up. If there is ever a time when they are my only choice for insurance, I will go uninsured. it seems you are less important to them than profit.",
        "This is one of my favorite Starbucks - not that I drink at any Starbucks particularly often. The location is a big plus, and the workers are always friendly. They are efficient as well - they have to be, considering how much traffic this store gets. If you walk in and see a bit of a line, just know that it tends to move fairly quickly.",
        "Great Starbucks coffee.  Enjoyed the worship team.    Pastor kept my attentions with his style.  Enjoyed the message.   Reminds me of other Mega church styles, including Elevation in Charlotte. Central, in Vegas and Saddleback Church, in Southern CA,",
        "Tasty desserts hand assembled by the chef.  It's good but I'd avoid coming during busy hours.",
        "What a wonderful experience! I have been jumping from dentist to dentist for the last 5 years. I am happy to say I have found a place to stay!",
        "This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!",
        "I'm giving this two stars only because our server was great.  We went for happy hour and perhaps that was the problem...the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy and tasted like they made it yesterday.  The tuna tataki didn't taste fresh and was rather bland.  We tried the inferno roll, but i could barely taste it through all the mayo.  On a positive note, the Godzilla tails were pretty tasty.  Sorry Shogun, you can do better!",
        "It's a really good crowd there and the food is better than just pub grub. I give them two stars because the place is posted (No Firearms) and you can no longer smoke on the patio. If those are of no concern to you then you will like the place just fine. I'm going to The Gym."

        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",
        "Pricey but hey..it's Vegas.\\nGreat drinks - they're strong and yummy!\\nGood selection of songs and nice variety. \\nLove the view!!!\\n\\nPS Check out the bathroom ;)",
        "Was walking around the Paris Casino and came upon a bar thatwas hopping to find out their were dueling piano players. So we decided to take a listien for a few songs and wound up staying there for several hours. Anybody who can pull off Motorhead's \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" is great in my book. They were extremely funny and kept you interested and having fun all night!",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Not a fan. He keeps shilling fad \\\"diet\\\" and \\\"nutritional\\\" products from some website, claiming he doesn't make a dime on them. Other issues I won't discuss here.",
        "This office is not conveniently located to my work or home. The other office where Dr. Carpenter works does not accept our vision insurance. In spite of these challenges I will continue to take my family to see Dr. Carpenter. the office staff is friendly and helpful. The facility is very nice and always clean. Dr. Carpenter has a kind demeanor and is unfailingly patient. If quality of care is your top priority this is the doctor for you.",
        "I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich.",
        "The food here is great, wonderful american-asian infusion.",
        "I'm not sure what your expecting for $16.99. I didn't mind it. I was on a diet when I ate here. It was doable but I did end up using all my calories at breakfast. Crazy, right? It was just average. It wasn't horrible. I've had horrible. It's just on the lower end for Las Vegas...or as the locals call it Vegas..or maybe they just say LV!",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "So this is my second attempt for this location. I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. \\n\\nThe second time they charged my food and someone else's. Even though I told her what I had. \\n\\nIt might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.",
        "Cant believe that this place got 4 and a half stars. Im asian and I have been driking a lot of bubble tea with tapioca from many places. This place has the worst tapioca that Ive ever tried. Who rates this place above 2 stars should go to california and try their tapioca over there.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!",
        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",
        "This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \\nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!",
        "A good burger and the best regular and sweet potato fries in PHX; however you need to provide good service.  The service is not as good as either Indulge, Zinburger or The Grind, and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods.  The food is very consistent; parking can be a bit difficult.",
        "Awesome bulgogi tacos! Chef didn't have Kim chi so he whipped up some Asian slaw for my friend. I had the New Mexico burger w/garlic fries, which were delicious! Brought home a pastrami sandwich w/garlic fries for the hubby. They must have been good because the only crumbs left were the ones on his shirt! Will definitely be back!",
        "friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.",
        "Too Good\\uff01\\uff01 the lady herself do all the cooking, but it tastes like home.  The Japche is Better than all the other big Korean restaurant I have ever eaten' h",
        "Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "This place will do well because it's trendy and modern inside. A cool ambiance..the food is just ok. The hash browns had way too much salt in them. The mushroom, spinach scramble was dry and bland.. Huevos Rancheros were just ok. But hey, it's probably a hip place to be so food is secondary I guess.",
        "This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012.",
        "Great location, great environment, and great food. Oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.",
        "Food is pretty normal, ethnic foods aren't to die for and are toned down to meet the tastes of the masses, prime rib is to die for! I went to breakfast and it was alright, now the worst but not the best, four stars because it really is good, but not as great as the other one I went to, it's a fair second though.",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "let me get straight to the point: don't come here!\\n\\ni paid $38.00 for a mediocre meal...and that was just the lunch price!\\n\\nit's a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasn't amazing at all. the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert bar....\\n\\nrefund please :(",
        "Wow is a good way to start with. I was blown away with this show. Words are hard to put together to show how much i loved it! A Beatles Tribute it is, the music had everyone moving to the beat. It was AWESOME for me and the Wife to see. It was the best show we have ever seen. And the best of Cirque du Soleil, I'd have to say.",
        "I've been here on 2 occasions. The first time I got the fried chicken benedict and it was not that great to me. I thought the smothering of the whole plate with the chipotle cream sauce ruined it for me. My second trip yielded much better results. I had the salmon scramble with brie cheese. It was delicious! Of course the portions are outrageous, but not a bad meal. Three people for breakfast was $76 with Mimosas of course.",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better.",
        "Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.",
        "This drive thru line is beyond insanely slow. If I could get out of line I would. I'm held hostage. I've listened to 4 songs in my CD already and I'm only third in line. Not worth the time wasted.",
        "Another great and honest service by Decatur Auto Electirc.  This is the 3rd time they have worked on my truck and have been resonable and honest each time.  Thank Luis and team for another job well done!  I will recomend you and be back with future issues I may encounter. Thanks, John",

        "Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.",
        "One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.",
        "These people are amazing! I consider myself a difficult customer and they always go above and beyond. I always leave happy! They are especially helpful about scheduling they are so accommodating. This is my third time here and ingot Christmas nails. So cute! I always go to Mimi! Such a sweetheart.",
        "If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \\\"chips\\\", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!\\n\\nHighly recommended for pizza!,",
        "I really can't comment on the \\\"value\\\" because my company picked up the tab, but I can say that the service they gave us was great and the food was good. I had their 16 oz steak and their cheesecake/sweet potato crust (both delicious!). Would be open to come back again.",
        "really love the mac n' cheese with meatballs. almost too rich, but the texture of the (pork?) meat provides a nice contrast to the pasta & cheese. portion size is fine for any normal sized society. only gets (a somewhat inflated) 2 stars cause i'd rather just say no to their 'asian' dishes than be disappointed.",
        "Ate with a client here today for the first time. Really enjoyed the yellow curry dish medium and the soup that comes before the meal, but the service was slow. It took 16 minutes for my entree to come, although after it came many employees asked if I wanted a drink refill.\\n\\nNice decor and decent prices",
        "Lots of options at good prices.  More creative menu offerings then, let's say, Denny's.  I also love the Wednesday free pie promotion.  I've had the Fresh Fruit & Chicken Salad and the Southwest Salad.  The salads were large and filling and the ingredients were fresh.  I've also had the tomato basil soup and it was all right but a little on the oily side.  Service is friendly and welcoming.",
        "Nice little place!  We had huevos rancheros with hand-made tortillas. Very nice family, their younger daughter serves.",
        "I had an awful experience - will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment/voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe - the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe.",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease. After one rather difficult appointment, Dr. Rapp called the next day to check on my daughter and make sure she was feeling well.",
        "It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it.",
        "Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.",
        "Is it a steakhouse or a singles bar?  With the music blasting out of the bar area, it is difficult to tell.  There are steak options every few blocks here in the Valley of the Sun, so skip this one and go to any of the other fine options.",
        "I want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible.   With so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent.",
        "I have been here two times. It's not a bad place. Atmosphere is very nice. Waitress was friendly. Food was not bad, pretty average. If I am in the mood for simple Korean food,  would come to this place.",
        "Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.\\nrest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .\\nWeekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.\\nbut weekdays pretty slow.\\nIf you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.",
        "It's a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront. The few times I've been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors.   The concept is there and I will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes.",
        "Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding. \\n\\nI love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-)\\nThey also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen. \\n\\nThe parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes.",
        "Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.\\n\\nThought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe. It's been a rough morning. Needless to say, my therapist is not going to be happy about this.\\n\\nSee photos.",
        "Fun place and 5$ dollar pitchers during he week. Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls.",
        "The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.",
        "This place was amazing, best AYCE in town! The customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil Asian waitress working haha. The Sex Bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered!  Definitely coming back soon!",
        "I've had great service here and I've had poor service here.  The food is pretty good, the shrimp and grits are very spicy, the veggie melt is heavenly, and the biscuits with berry jam is so special I could eat them daily.  That being said, the hit or miss service will probably keep me away for awhile.......hopefully when I decide to return they will have the service issues corrected.",
        "This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \\n\\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area.",
        "Atmosphere pretty good.  Had the fish and chips, good portion and fresh cod. Had an early lunch so I can't comment about the atmosphere during busy time. Give this place a try, great location in downtown Chandler.",
        "The sushi here is not bad, but not great. Service is also up to par. Sushi rock pails in comparison, however, to nearby restaurants, that have much better quality sushi, and hover around the same price. Though I may come here again for Korean food, I will not be returning for sushi.",
        "We called for hotel reservations.  I can't believe how I was spoken to.  The young lady must have had chip on her shoulder.  I guess she thought I was supposed to be serving her.  I hope the stay is more enjoyable than the reservation experience.\\n\\nJohnny J..",
        "It's not fancy Asian food. But it taste great. I compare other Thai / Asian food to this place. Never had a bad experience or incorrect order.",
        "No more $1 beers and lowered crown credits! Don't bother going to this shit hole. It has gone way downhill in the last few months. Machines are outdated and now my favorite quarter machines that actually have a bonus feature were changed to a penny denomination. Won't be back! Poor return for what your bet is. Virtually impossible to even win a little to keep playing. Take your business to Casino Arizona!",
        "The equipment is well maintained and the place is always clean. The downside is a general lack of choices in the area so it's always crowded and it's often impossible to get a treadmill and have a routine on machines. I don't have a lot of time and this poses a bit of a problem. It's a good gym, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a friend.",
        "Amazing beef rib & baby back pork ribs!!! Super cute place & great prices...the outlaw burger was ok..not so great as i expected it to be..",
        "I don't quite get this place or why Asians love it, but it is very good :)",
        "i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!",
        "I miss Dim Sum. New Orleans is not a place to live if it's a staple in your diet. I loved the hustle and bustle of Asian familes and the harried staff. The dumplings themselves were good, the tea piping hot, but wished we had ordered some broccoli.\\n\\nThat is all.",
        "The food and service here was great...Belle was nice in making sure everything was more than satisfactory.  I really enjoyed this new Korean restaurant, and can't wait to get back.  I've already let several friends know to make their way over there.",
        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.",
        "Last night was my first time here, and I enjoy Ingrosso.  That aside it was too loud, waaayy too loud.  It was impossible to talk to my friends.  \\n\\nThe venue itself seems thrown together.  It's too large--now I see why Marquee closes off sections as it gets later and why Light closes the balcony off on slow nights.\\n\\nYou won't see me here again.",
        "Although the repair work was fine, the customer service was terrible!  No communication and very difficult to talk to someone.  I called them on day promised and they said the work was done and give them another hour so they could wash the car and double check work.  I picked up rhe car and it was not washed!  Would not use them again.",
        "I ordered the $39.99 all you can eat meat; all of the meats were very dry!! The worst of the worst was the lamb, dry as hell and very gamey tasting. The worst lamb I've ever had. The acceptable items were the flank steak and the turkey wrapped in bacon, but not by much. \\n\\nDon't wast your time, money, or the opportunity to eat somewhere else.",
        "Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.",
        "I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue.",
        "Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "This was one of my few choices for food at 2am...c'mon, Vegas!\\n\\nWhile limited, the late night menu was good, albeit pricey.  The Asian wings were fabulous!",
        "An absolutely unhesistant 5 stars. Best culinary experience I had in Pittsburgh and ranks up there among my best meals ever.\\n\\nLots of playing with textures, incredibly fresh ingredients, interesting flavour combinations, this place has it all. There were a lot of asian influences in the menu items and the chef leans towards more simple, elegant flavours that highlight the freshness of the ingredients.\\n\\nI loved every bite.",
        "Got the Korean Burger.  Eh.  It was super sweet.  Overpowering sweet.  The meat was cooked really well but the flavors just didn't work.  Truffle mac and cheese was just not good.  Texture, flavor, cheesiness, just off.  The Grasshopper shake was very good but didn't get me to any level of drunkiness and the onion rings were pretty good.  There are better hamburger places out there.",
        "Off the charts.  Delicious.  How can a boiled rib taste so good!   Huge portions.  Really nice staff.  Thoroughly impressed.   A must eat local.",
        "Always come for the breakfast buffet. I love the French toast and the fresh fruit. The waitresses are always nice to deal with. \\nBeing a club member you sometimes get deals in the mail for buy one get one free and that always makes it nice.\\nBreakfast is 8-10:30",
        "For me, this is heaven. \\n\\nI love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display. It truly makes me happy. The very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back. It's a glorious oasis of size 4's just waiting for me to come by and pluck them, like ripened grapes from the vine :) Delightful!",
        "I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact.",
        "First place I wanted to go to for breakfast when arriving to Las Vegas was hash house a go go. This was my very first time at this place. I would say that this is one of my top favorite places! They serve big portions that could be enough for two ppl. Their food is delicious!! I love it even more because they give you a side of fruit which all breakfast Places should have. You gotta try it out for yourself, it's so worth it.",
        "Love their pizza!!! Always fresh & made to order!  Try the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream :)",
        "This Irish bar is pretty typical for a casino.  I.E. there isn't much Irish to it.  But it does have a decent selection of beers.  Sometimes they bring in very weird bands or groups to play music.  I would say it would be worth stopping by and grabbing a beer.  Plus you can keep the glass."

        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Just like many other Ritas, but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store.  Only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "We love this place! The breakfast is homemade fresh and hot. The service is always great and very welcoming. My fianc\\u00e9 and I always try new places but end up back at good old Nicks. A couple times we had off days the food was just ok but it still nocked most places out of the water. Way to go Nicks we love ya",

        "This is a nice Mom & Pop caf\\u00e9 with a personable staff always willing to help accommodate customers.  Owner comes to see if there is anything he can do to make your visit a good one. Prices are  reasonable. Cheerful and happy staff! Always meets  you with a smile. Omelets are HUGE!",
        "Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \\n\\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\\n\\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)",
        "I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.",
        "This caf\\u00e9, conveniently situated opposite McGill, is a very good addition to the downtown scene. The coffee is excellent, and the owner Jason and his colleagues provide friendly service. The pastries, which come from a small bakery in the east end, are delicious (think muffins like mother used to make). I drop in as often as I can.",
        "Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE.",
        "Ate there last week, kind of high priced for the fare we ordered. I had the petite steak, they were right. Did not mind the small steak, but the sides were small & not creative, should have a potato, steamed veggies, or brown rice, for this dish.",
        "I love the Beef Pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw. I will be back once it's under 100\\u00b0 again - because seriously, soup in the summer just sucks.",
        "Wonderful!  The food, service & atmosphere are great.  Miso carbonara is so good without the richness.  Deserts are excellent we had the tiaramisou.  Next time we try the creme brulee.  The staff is gracious and friendly.  We will be back.",

        "I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",
        "I just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here. Both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time. I took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong. You would think Dunkin Donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves.",
        "Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.",
        "Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare.",
        "Great location, great environment, and great food. Oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended.",
        "The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \\\"gross\\\" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around.",
        "Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \\n\\nOur dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \\n\\nBF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew.",
        "Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad.",
        "J'y vais pour le kokosh, une brioche roul\\u00e9e au chocolat \\u00e0 se rouler par terre",
        "This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place.",
        "The tacos are terrible. The shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco.  Customer service is a nightmare!",
        "I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.",
        "This place seemed like a typical diner but beware, it was not.\\n\\nThe cups were dirty (old lipstick) and my side of peaches came with a moldy piece the waitress, Pam, tried to convince me was a 'mushroom'.\\n\\nAfter a disgusting experience, at no point did the manager come over or the waitress apologize.\\n\\nI would not recommend this place to anyone and if I could rate below one star, I would.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.",
        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "Had their ngohiong and steamed rice for take out! It may not have tasted exactly like my childhood favorites, but they were close and delicious enough to bring me home and have me wanting more!",
        "Food is pretty normal, ethnic foods aren't to die for and are toned down to meet the tastes of the masses, prime rib is to die for! I went to breakfast and it was alright, now the worst but not the best, four stars because it really is good, but not as great as the other one I went to, it's a fair second though.",

        "Food was pretty good. The power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 90-95 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable. The manager said \\\"we can't control Nevada power.\\\" Creamed spinach was no good. Lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  The steak just ok.",
        "One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious.",
        "The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!",

        "I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better.",
        "Renegade always has consistently great food. It's also very nice inside with an open atmosphere and classy decor. I love everything on their menu, and I usually get their salmon. And... best of all.... the BREAD PUDDING. So nom. My parents really like the creme brulee too. Great spot with great food!",
        "One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Vegas! I love the reuben, especially how it's packed with corned beef, light on the cheese, and kraut. The portions are big, and I never skip on ordering the Matzo ball soup. Nice, casual place to eat.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",

They told me they will have a terrace for this summer :)  the great thing is they  change the table d'h\\u00f4te several times during the week so you don't get bored of the same menu. Finally great food with a great price .",

        "If I could give this place 0 stars I would, that is how bad the food was. It seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn. I didn't think it was humanly possible, but I have finally found a buffet worse than Hometown Buffet. Good job Circus Circus.",

        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",

        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared.

This is currently my favorite raw food venue.",

I'd ordered the curry chicken which was definitely much spicier than I'd hoped but nonetheless it was good. For lunch you get soup, your meal choice plus rice, and a yummy wonton all at a decent price. Happy I found this joint.",

I had gotten an estimate from them to do a brake service and replacement on my vehicle and after my jaw dropped from the extravagant price they called me to reduce the original estimate they had given me by three thousand dollars!!!! Do they think I am an idiot!!! I will never do and business with this dealership. I will surely not ever buy an overpriced car from them either.",
        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.

        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",

Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.",

        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",

Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "Not too impressed.  The service was so-so and no one helped us with how to do this.  At previous Mongolian places I had put the sauce in the bowl.  The cook yelled at me for doing this saying it would all cook away (?) He made me get more in the little cup and it ended up so strong I could hardly eat it.  The atmosphere is sorta cold.  Idk...we just didnt care for it much =(",

        "I really wish this review could be great because my wife and I love other mellow mushrooms were we have dined and very happy to have one now uptown. However, the Uptown location doesn't quite seem to be ready for prime time business.  Lack of staff but plenty of seating.  Be prepared to wait.  I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",
        "I love Ross and I love a bargain, but why is this particular location almost always half empty? The racks look so sad! I try to check this place out often and it's always the same: half empty racks. This isn't the best Ross location in town so don't make a special trip to shop here. As with every Ross, checkout lines are ridiculously long.",
        "This place is a ripoff. I had a storage unit for 2 years here. When I deceided to give it up they would not prorate my fees when I was told by the staff and manager that they prorate fees. They had no concern for my situation, the staff is very unfriendly. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.",
        "I wouldn't give it 2*s if they wouldn't have crab legs and a decent waitress. The food....skip it....the whole place has a hometown buffet energy to it...just sad....even the smell is akward.  Why would u put a restaurant in the basement area??? Smh....",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!"

It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",

        "Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!",
        "It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "This place serves the best burger I have ever had. It's a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food. No weaknesses.\\n\\nGo for the Delux Burger with sweet taters (and extra helpings of aioli).",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",

HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",

They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!",
        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Had lunch here with some people from work and as always its great.  The service was a little slow, but what isnt in Vegas.  \\nI had the Grilled Shrimp Salad with a extra shrimp.  It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone..",

It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",
        "Great People, Great Shop. They have some of the best people in the industry working hard to make it happen and they offer better than new service. They have great accessibility and good group rides. I highly recommend them. The selection is just awesome there too. Parking isn't all that bad either. Check 'em out!",
        "Sorry to say that Rey and Becky (owners) have let down there regulars on a regular basis.  We've had problems the last three times and they've either got it wrong or took way too long.  Tonight was no different.  They catered to a large party and told us they purposely out to go orders behind them...I've been a regular since they've opened.  For better service go to Tomo...WAY BETTER SERVICE!!!!",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",

It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",

My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",

        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",

Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",

The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",

Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",

Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place.",
        "Love the milk tea boba drinks here! They have a variety of tea selections. Great place to hang and relax in the late night. Great staff and customer service. I am starting to sample the other drinks and the staff can help make suggestion and explain what are the different drinks they offer.  I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \\n\\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.",
        "Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety.",
        "Food is good, service is bad.  Have been here twice...both times our order was screwed up.  The second time we received no apology.  Wait staff is reactive instead of proactive.  Food is decent but expect more for the money.  I really wanted to like this place but I have been given too many reasons to go elsewhere.",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.",
        "I love the concept of this place, but at $9 for an adult admission I'm disappointed in the number of items and selection that were on collection in the galleries. \\n\\nHowever, if you want to support the preservation of black art this is a great place to spend an hour in.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "Very nice owner. Did handgun transfer at the store. Also score a Colt Python during transfer. Will definitely buy again.",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "Love it!!! Looks real divey from the outside and way small. Inside, total tiki tradition! Salty but sweet bartendress, cheap drinks guaranteed to get you wasted. Get a drink in a mug, they're worth it!!",
        "This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour.",
        "Been there several times.   Greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Servers took orders quickly and knew the menu well.   Specials were related and all questions answered.\\n\\nFood served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.\\n\\nService seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently.",
        "I had the Hawaiian hot dog, small fry and small drink. My order came to $10 and some change. I was shocked when I was given the total for my order. It's crazy to be charged $10 for what I ordered. The fries were too salty. \\n\\nThe garbage can that I used was filthy. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks. Disgusting.",
        "I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\\n\\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!",
        "Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here.",
        "Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \\\"happy hour\\\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!",
        "Smoothie King is like a broke Jamba Juice! When I came here it was packed with loads of people and the staff here are far from good customer service. The way it is set up makes no sense what so ever. When it was time to pay the guy ringing us up got our order wrong and wanted me to $18.00 for two smoothies..overall smoothies were good but don't think i would go back ever again.",
        "Nolia serves upscale Southern cuisine, and my dinner there was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The pork was tender and the sweet potatoes were perfect. Nolia, in an historic house in Elizabeth, reminded me of Charleston, SC. The fancy, but friendly atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. That location has seen many restaurants. I hope Nolia lasts.",
        "What a great spot for good burgers and dog. We enjoyed both & they were served quickly and cheap prices. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, hot & cooked to perfection. I am a ketchup girl, but they served them with a creamy mustard dipping sauce that was a great second option."

        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.",
        "Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!",
        "I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.",
        "If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.",
        "I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \\n\\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear.",
        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "This show is pretty incredible and yes, gravity defying, but if you have seen the traveling Cirque shows it may leave you wanting more. The production value and moving stage is something to be seen, and if you can, do. I just thought the show was more choreography than acrobatics. The shifting, ever evolving stage on hydraulic shafts? AMAZING. whoever thought of that should get a medal.",
        "Got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious. I thought it was actually pretty big for a small, but would be good for sharing. Also got a thai iced tea with boba. The boba has great consistency and tastes just right.",
        "saw the show tonight and it was ok ..dont expect anything spectacular but it is worth the 10.00 you pay at gold star for it.  all the seats are pretty good but kind of a run down theatre but manageable. Jokes arent all that funny but hey they are trying and the show is a pretty low budget show.. But for the money it will most likely entertain you.",

Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Super awesome event. They managed to cater to my veggie needs. The set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the Moscatohad to be the strongest ever. We loved it, the first two dishes win the others no so much. One person said they could see they're reflection in the cheese!!!  Yikes",

Got one cheese slice and it was just great.\\n\\nI haven't had an authentic new york style pizza, so I couldn't compare, but for pizza it was really good.\\n\\nThis place is small and if busy might be hard to find a spot to sit and eat, but pizza is pretty easy to just eat on the go.",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.",

The mojito's were still kick ass!",

I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. \\n\\nThe second time they charged my food and someone else's.

Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",

The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "OMG! Finally! A pizza shop that doesn't charge $8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies. The food is pretty good and very affordable. \\n\\nThe only problem I have is that my workplace puts in a $300+ order every friday and they never throw out any deals. Not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers' business.",
        "Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.",
        "It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \\\"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\\\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.",

        "The variety is great, but I think they if they served the princess cupcake every day they would get so much more business! Cupcakes are top heavy which is fine because the icing taste way better than the cake itself. I found the cake portion of the cupcake to be mediocre but the icing is totally worth it! The best flavors are Miss Princess, Wedding Cake, & Birthday cake. I do feel the prices are too high.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch.

Only cash or debit card.",
        "eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale.",

        "The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \\\"gross\\\" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around.",

        "Pizza is just about the right size for a quick lunch, try the firecracker crust, not real spicy but has some taste to it. Only down side is crust is a little soggy for me, not a deal beaker but a little crisp to the bottom would be better.  Neat idea and pretty tastey all the way around.",
        "If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "Food is Okay. Breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads and sandwiches were decent. Can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.",
        "The SoHo Gourmet food cart is so yummy. The So Chick dumplings are my favorite. The salads compliment the dumplings very well. Love that new rice boxes are being offered this year. I had a sample of the rice today. It was really good. I knew I should gotten out earlier.",
        "This store is like a Mega store. Maybe they are a little bit over they head because sadly the meats are not the best. They have meat on sale for 3 and 4 bucks and its coloring is brown to black. Meat should be Red. I will shop here but I will stay away from the meat. If you can get pass that the store is really ok.",
        "I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up.",
        "Have come here a couple of times and it will be our go-to now.They have a fantastic happy hour, quality-wise and price-wise. The place is prettier on the inside than the outside and it's easy to miss. Has been pretty quiet when we've been in, around 4 pm on weekdays. Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!",
        "Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken",
        "We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok.",
        "I came here for lunch and wasn't very impressed. Unless you're already on your way in or out of Vegas, I don't think it's worth the drive. There was just nothing that tasted particularly special. I did hear that dinner is better because you can take advantage of the alcohol and pretty much preparty while you have dinner.",
        "Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.",
        "I definitely get more out of a massage, but for what it is-it's a neat service to have as a walk-in. My back refused to crack because my muscles were so tight, so I didn't feel like I got much out of it. :( my neck popped pretty decent though and I got a good stretching. The doctor was really nice. Next time I will just go get a massage instead..."

        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",
        "Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service.\\nCould hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly.\\nDo not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.\\n\\nGood thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went on a Saturday night so it was bustling with young people. They have every fun bar game you could imagine: pool, darts, shuffle board, air hockey, karaoke, and more. They also have Shocktop on tap which is a win-win for me. Get a couple drinks in you and you are bound to have a blast here. I know I did.",
        "This office is not conveniently located to my work or home. The other office where Dr. Carpenter works does not accept our vision insurance. In spite of these challenges I will continue to take my family to see Dr. Carpenter. the office staff is friendly and helpful. The facility is very nice and always clean. Dr. Carpenter has a kind demeanor and is unfailingly patient. If quality of care is your top priority this is the doctor for you.",
        "CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.  This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain.\\n\\nThe savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.  I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.  Awesome store!!!",
        "I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "Really enjoyed myself at the Auto Collections! The cars are beautiful, and there are so many of them! \\n\\nPrice is reasonable (12.50 I believe).\\n\\nWould recommend to anyone who loves old cars!",
        "I was in need of gas and I kept passing places that just seemed too expensive (in the NW area), I don't live on the NW side of town so I was unsure of where to go. Luckily this station was much cheaper and convenient to where I was going. I will use this place for gas if I'm in the area in need of a fill up again.",
        "I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.",
        "I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...",
        "So this is my second attempt for this location. I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. \\n\\nThe second time they charged my food and someone else's. Even though I told her what I had. \\n\\nIt might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.",
        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "Sat at the bar, no music or sound on the TVs, after I asked for the second time some music was turned on, some sort of low sounding reggae I think, could barely hear it. No food on the happy hour menu, $3 Cuba Libra's, I enjoyed those. Didn't sample the food. Might come back not sure yet.",
        "Had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues. Food was very good, service very good. Great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the \\\"courtyard\\\" outside the restaurant's entry.\\n\\nDefinitely would go again.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "On behalf of the Lil Saints 12U girls softball team, I would like to thank Zzeeks for their continued support of our girls throughout this season. You have helped our team raise funds through fundraisers & it's greatly appreciated! Zzeeks will continue to be our team hang out & a true family favorite. Thanks again Zzeeks!!",
        "Specialising in mussels, oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we weren't disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains. Yummy. Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken. However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didn't have to wait too long.",
        "Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",
        "Love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store!",
        "This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \\nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!",
        "Never and I say NEVER input your real social security # and phone #'s unless you want to be harassed for the rest of your life.  The kicker is there's no way to close your account or stop being harassed, even after you click \\\"unsubscribe\\\".",
        "Definitely worth the watch. We found that they had the understudy performing parts and she often sounded better. Though mostly just a personal preference for voices.",
        "A good burger and the best regular and sweet potato fries in PHX; however you need to provide good service.  The service is not as good as either Indulge, Zinburger or The Grind, and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods.  The food is very consistent; parking can be a bit difficult.",
        "Enjoyed a healthy and delicious lunch from a very diverse menue.  Delightful attention and atmosphere...Highly recommend the alternative experience.  I'll definitely return....",
        "Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.",
        "Its ok. The women at the desks seem to always be very busy. But the 2 different Optometrist that I've spoken to me have always been really nice. Also he pronounced my name correctly and even showed off some of his Spanish speaking skills. Impressive\\nPros: Optometrist\\nCons: Front Desk",
        "The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.",
        "Really liked this place.  It had a nice layout of the casino floor, it was not smokey, and it had a very open feel to it.  Well kept up.  Stop by and say hi.",
        "The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "Great staff and ambiance. Gorgonzola salad was delicious.  Grilled veggie pizza could have had a little more flavor.  Simple but good.  The scientist pizza was fabulous !!!\\n\\nUpdate - We went back for more and thoroughly enjoyed the The Simple Margherita Finished with Wild Arugula and Shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Consistently great!",
        "I'm in town for an hour saw this place on line before we left Angel Fire.  Chef John Murphy is outstanding not only regarding the meal but in regards to excellent customer service as well. Enjoyed it immensity and will be back later this week. Thanks John! !!!",
        "8 of us just finished eating here.  Service was very friendly, prices were definitely reasonable, and we all really enjoyed our meals. \\n\\nI would come back again for sure!\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn't snap any photos of our food, but here are a few of the place.",
        "Our first time here! Very relaxing and service was excellent! James and the manager took care of us! We enjoyed the food.",
        "I've now eaten here 3 times. 2 out of the 3, our order was taken correctly, the kitchen made the wrong order. The last time, they even made the reorder wrong. Food is decent and priced fairly. you won't be blown away by anything",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",
        "I had eaten at this restaurant once before and enjoyed the stuffed chile and returned for the same item.  This time it was more bland and slimply hot and not cheesy.  I also tried the Pizza which was surprisingly good (4 cheese) but had too thick a crust to be exceptional.  An interesting but not really a \\\"New Mexican\\\" restaurant, Gardunos, while generic in some ways, is actually the real thing.",
        "Everyone else enjoyed it, so I guess I'm on my own.  It was just OK.  It went too long for my tastes, so my friend and I ditched out after an hour and change.  I think it was close to over, but we had seen enough lip syncing for a night.",
        "good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.",
        "Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.",
        "I had the Hawaiian hot dog, small fry and small drink. My order came to $10 and some change. I was shocked when I was given the total for my order. It's crazy to be charged $10 for what I ordered. The fries were too salty. \\n\\nThe garbage can that I used was filthy. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks. Disgusting.",
        "Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at BC today. The food and service was wonderful. My guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was. It's always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this.",
        "This place is pretty secluded. If you don't know the neighborhood you'd probably never find it. Luckily I was on a food tour. Its a small convenient store with beer, wine, and other random goodies like yellow stone ground grits (yes I bought some). It has a deli counter and you can create your own sandwich. The owners are pretty cool people too! Look it up and stop in!",
        "WOW, times must be truly hard if they aren't able to fill a Cirque du Soleil stadium on a Saturday night in the prime section. We went last minute because the young man wanted to watch it again and boy I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it even the 2nd time round. We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around.",
        "What a great spot for good burgers and dog. We enjoyed both & they were served quickly and cheap prices. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, hot & cooked to perfection. I am a ketchup girl, but they served them with a creamy mustard dipping sauce that was a great second option.",
        "I didn't have a room here, just came to gamble/drink. Southpoint is nice refresher to keep away from the crowds and people from the strip. Mostly local people here and i like how they are quick with the beers at the video poker at the center bar. I will definitely come back here...",
        "let me get straight to the point: don't come here!\\n\\ni paid $38.00 for a mediocre meal...and that was just the lunch price!\\n\\nit's a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasn't amazing at all. the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert bar....\\n\\nrefund please :(",
        "Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \\nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.",
        "This is a great place to bring out of towners who think Phoenix is a hubble of sand. The patio is wonderful, the food is terrific, and the staff is helpful and not too \\\"in your face fancy.\\\"\\nAlso- the wine list it to die for.\\nThanks for always making us have a good time, Lon's. You're a Phoenix, okay PV classic.",
        "I've been here on 2 occasions. The first time I got the fried chicken benedict and it was not that great to me. I thought the smothering of the whole plate with the chipotle cream sauce ruined it for me. My second trip yielded much better results. I had the salmon scramble with brie cheese. It was delicious! Of course the portions are outrageous, but not a bad meal. Three people for breakfast was $76 with Mimosas of course.",
        "Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again.",
        "Their products, service and prices are phenomenal. Their product prices got my business and their prompt and courteous customer service and amazing product quality will keep me coming back. I know that once my order is placed I don't need to worry - it will done correctly and on time!",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "Portions were huge!  We ate it all though.  That must have meant the food was tasty.  My wife and I shared one dish, The New Mexican Platter.  We also enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.",
        "Just not very good.  Got 2 meat combo (bulgogi and chicken).  Got home and was mostly rice.  Chicken dry and the least impressive bulgogi i've had.  If the owner/cashier would have been nice, it would have been the unity saving grace but he was rude.  Too many bomb Korran places out here to come here again.",
        "Sat in the front row, Got wet and watched a pretty cool show. Its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout. Worth the watch but definately not for the money. Seen better for less.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure.",
        "Can't speak for the rooms, but the Casino remodel is very nice and provides a much needed improvement.  I enjoyed gambling there for a couple of hours.",
        "We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a long weekend and I ended up at Border Grill a couple times.  The 4 stars are really for the weekend brunch - all you can eat tapas that were interesting and (mostly) tasty.  I went back for the margaritas later which were also tasty though not particularly cheap.  You'd think the upstairs patio would be a good place to watch the beach concerts but the waiter said it was too dark to see the stage. Alas.",
        "This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",
        "I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.",
        "I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",
        "I really enjoyed my choice of black coffee here while my friends didn't. I just think they chose the wrong one. I got the one that was mixed with dark and light roast beans. I can't remember the name but it was delicious! No disgusting coffee aftertaste. All in all, I'd be back here and get the same coffee the next time I'm in town!",
        "The yogurt is very creamy and good but they're slacking on the toppings compared to Zoyo. But I mainly gave Orange Leaf a lower rating because the staff are not friendly. I sometimes go just because it's close and it's a little cheaper than the other froyo joints.",
        "These people are amazing! I consider myself a difficult customer and they always go above and beyond. I always leave happy! They are especially helpful about scheduling they are so accommodating. This is my third time here and ingot Christmas nails. So cute! I always go to Mimi! Such a sweetheart.",
        "My family and I tried this for the first time about a week ago. The food was unique, and very good for adults, but my kids freaked out about it. They had very unique draft beers and unusual drink choices.  It was a little Spendey, but we really enjoyed the change.  Great happy hour prices and happy hour every day of the week.",
        "Went there with a party of 9 and they refused to seat us together. Service was awefull and food took over an hour. They were not busy.   Some people liked the food, some didn't. My spaghetti carbonale was very dry, not good at all.  \\nDefinitely don't recommend this place.  they just didn't seem to care.",
        "I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.",
        "Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Dirty store, the most Ghetto, worst customer service including management, aisles always blocked at night so customers can't walk through loud vulgar employees yelling through the store. More people begging in parking lot than customers. Products never labeled correctly. Never enough cashiers or employees at customer service desk.",
        "Love this service.   I use it about once a month to PHX and often on the other end of my flights too if I am not renting a car.   Always on time, always courteous.   I use them for business trips mostly, easy online booking even for same day a couple hours in advance.   If I need them sooner than that I usually call...have never had an issue.",
        "If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \\\"chips\\\", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!\\n\\nHighly recommended for pizza!,",
        "If you are looking for a clean place this is probably not the place.  Something has to be said about the cooling system (aka the huge floor fan in the back).  The tables are sticky and the bathroom door is black and it is not the paint.  However the food is great and mostly (emphasis on mostly) fresh.  Don't come here if you are looking for a pleasant atmosphere and it is probably better to get your food to go!",
        "First visit and very impressed.  Excellent quality and personable service. Clean, modern interior. An excellent addition to Henderson. Both owners took the time to come by our table and introduce themselves and ask how we liked the food.  Good portions and the quality is obvious.  We will be back many times.  Check this one out!",
        "Ate with a client here today for the first time. Really enjoyed the yellow curry dish medium and the soup that comes before the meal, but the service was slow. It took 16 minutes for my entree to come, although after it came many employees asked if I wanted a drink refill.\\n\\nNice decor and decent prices",
        "I think I've officially had my first taste of real southern BBQ.  This stuff was slow cooked and flavored just right.  I really liked how the brisket was nice and tender.  And the sauce a very nice addition to the flavors of the meat.  The people were fast and friendly and it was a really fun time.",
        "Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.",
        "This is a really terrific restaurant the food was fantastic and their happy hr menu has a ridiclious selection of great food. Oyster's on the 1/2 shell, butternut squash raviolo, crab stuffed mushrooms. The decor an atmosphere is very fun. We will be going back to try the regular menu as there are some very inviting dishes to try.\\n\\nYes the staff is not the best but the food was good.",
        "Got a tepid cup of coffee at 7:00 am that tastes like it was brewed with tea mixed in with it.  It doesn't appear these people can even do coffee correctly.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "People there were all unfriendly\\nFood was undercooked and served cold\\nWaitress was rude\\nPancakes tasted like bleach\\nWater tasted like sewer water\\nWe never got any drink refills\\nTable was dirty when we sat down and we asked if it could be wiped off. It never was\\nDo not waste your money on this place",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease.

        "I really enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere here.  My mom and I ate here for restaurant week and its was delicious.  The blackened brie is a definite winner as is the decadent hot chocolate dessert.  All the staff were very attentive and I also liked how the managers showed an involvement in the restaurant which is something you do not see all the time. Will defintely be going back.",

The service was good. Calm atmosphere. \\nI'd eat here again, but mostly because it's quick when my blood sugar is low.",
        "A few friends and I visited Mt. Everest India's Cuisine and we all agreed that we enjoyed this place a lot.  The service was very good - we felt neither rushed nor neglected. The owner is good at guiding hesitant diners to the type of dish he feels each would appreciate. We had a lot of fun sharing 5 different dishes- all were delicious.Definitely a place to return to.",

After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit.",
        "Liked it! Porterhouse was good! wedge salad could have been bigger for the price. corn chowder very nice. soft shell crab YUMMM! But the best part is the FRIES! maybe that duck fat business is what it is but i always ask for more. PRICE $$$ but its nice if you like MEAT! i like it med- well and they did that very well(good). nice place to try in vegas!"

We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",

One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling.

Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "Food portions were gigantic and flavorless. Service was absolutely despicable.

        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",
        "Worst service ever!  11 minutes to get my order inside with only 2 people in  front of me.  They pay attention to the drive through only, and that too looks slow. Dont go here!  They are rude too!",
        "No star would be better, horrible customer service in the \\\"SERVICE\\\" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",
        "Waiting for the connection flight, I decided to get a beer. I found the Home Turf Bar, which was right next to my gate.\\n\\nI wasn't hungry and just wanted a quick beer before my flight. They had Shocktop, which is okay with me. It was an okay place to pass the time before it was time to move on.",
        "This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The service is always friendly and attentive. Food comes out amazingly quick. I highly recommend their Bacon Benedict, and a stack of some of the best pancakes you'll ever have.",
        "I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",
        "After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives i thought I would try it out.  The Pig Dip is the signature dish and it was everything I thought it would be.  Edgy atmosphere and complimentary valet parking made it convenient. \\n\\nService was average and the valet driver was not afraid to hit the gas and squeal the tires on my Tundra.\\n\\nGo for the food, you won't be disappointed.",
        "My favorite bar in Vegas! The staff is awesome, atomosphere is always fun and the owners take care of locals. Best place to hang out!!!",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me.",

        "Was walking around the Paris Casino and came upon a bar thatwas hopping to find out their were dueling piano players. So we decided to take a listien for a few songs and wound up staying there for several hours. Anybody who can pull off Motorhead's \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" is great in my book. They were extremely funny and kept you interested and having fun all night!",
        "Bought my R6 in march of 2010. Best service and still receiving discounts on gear. Manager is awesome and made my life a little happier by selling me my Yamaha.",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",

        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business.",
        "One of my absolute favorite places in Vegas! Such a great piano bar and so completely underrated. The bartenders have some of the best voices I've ever heard (Specifically Dre- Amazing voice!!!) great entertainment and a must visit if you are in Fremont St",
        "This is located conveniently next to the hard rock hotel. When they say everything is bigger in Vegas, they aren't kidding. This cvs was huge and had everything you could possibly need. The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \\nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open.",
        "My cousin and I went to this place together and she was not a fan of it. If she could rate it from 1-500 she said, she would rate it 500- but it's a negative. It wasn't my cup of tea either.\\nNote that the wallpaper is hideous and their decorations consist of chili peppers dangling from the wall.",
        "I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \\n\\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "This office is not conveniently located to my work or home. The other office where Dr. Carpenter works does not accept our vision insurance. In spite of these challenges I will continue to take my family to see Dr. Carpenter. the office staff is friendly and helpful. The facility is very nice and always clean. Dr. Carpenter has a kind demeanor and is unfailingly patient. If quality of care is your top priority this is the doctor for you.",
        "My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.",
        "Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also. \\nSake bomb, anyone? :-)",
        "Just had my haircut an hour ago and already two strangers have complimented the cut. Jason's work is the best in town.  He really understands how to make wavy, unruly hair look fabulous.  Plus, the scalp massage, complimentary coffee and hip setting makes one feel they are getting the star treatment.",
        "This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!",
        "THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass.",
        "I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet",
        "My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.",
        "Super awesome event. They managed to cater to my veggie needs. The set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the Moscatohad to be the strongest ever. We loved it, the first two dishes win the others no so much. One person said they could see they're reflection in the cheese!!!  Yikes",
        "I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich.",
        "One of my favorite omlettes of all time. Solid cup of coffee, good ambiance, and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store. Great breakfast place, be sure to stop in!",
        "The new location is huge! Been bringing my dogs to Grand Paws for a couple years. Very sweet staff, good follow up, in and out appointments!",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.",
        "Holy Tequila!  Luv the margaritas here!  House margaritas are the best.  I highly recommend the Cucumber margarita!  Its cool and refreshing with the perfect amount of tequila.  Great drink for the hot AZ summer!  Tinga tacos are my absolutely favorite.  Great crunchy chicken taco!  Great place in OT for some awesome food and drinks.  This is one of the best happy hour locations in town!",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \\nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.",
        "How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment .",
        "I had the Lobster Burger! Yes, I said Lobster Burger. It was PHENOMENAL! OMG! I have never had anything like it. THE best thing I have ever put in my mouth!\\nThe service was impeccable! This place rocks! Open 24/7 too!",
        "They always take the time with my kids and are very good.  Sometimes they have a waiting list and often are booked up....so I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment.  But it is very worth it as the results speak for themselves.",
        "Had a scheduled appt for these guys to come out and fix patio door-no show-no call-didn't return my call. Tells me they are independently wealthy and don't need new business.  Advice to everyone, Pass on this one when looking",
        "Not impressed with my last visit. Pizza was not good and service wasn't either.",
        "Will always remain one of my 'to go' places when passing through vegas.",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Went climbing here about 4 months ago and used their rented shoes.... Left with a minor blister-like object on my 2nd toe and to this day I still have it.... if you can, BRING YOUR OWN SHOES... unless you want some nasty looking growth on your toe :/",
        "Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.",
        "Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.",

When I am on vacation it pretty much an all you can eat time. I absolutely enjoy trying new places and cannot resist temptation; therefore, out with \\\"No Meat March\\\" and in with Smash Burger! It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",
        "Can i give this place zero stars?????  $85.00 for a \\\"Deluxe\\\" Pedicure and it was the worst, quickest, wambam thankyou mam pedicure.  Horrible!!!!!  They won't be getting another dime of my money.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.",

        "This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly",
        "I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "I'm not sure what your expecting for $16.99. I didn't mind it. I was on a diet when I ate here. It was doable but I did end up using all my calories at breakfast. Crazy, right? It was just average. It wasn't horrible. I've had horrible. It's just on the lower end for Las Vegas...or as the locals call it Vegas..or maybe they just say LV!",
        "So this is my second attempt for this location. I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. \\n\\nThe second time they charged my food and someone else's. Even though I told her what I had. \\n\\nIt might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.",

        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "The food at Big View is decent but the service is slooooooooow. Like, unbelievably slow. Not just during one visit, but on all of them. My parents also agree, they started going to Big View in hopes of something similar to the NY/NJ diners they were used to, and quit going because everything took way too long. Very disappointing.",
        "My friend kept saying: I have to get Nine's Gnocchi while we're here. Thankfully, I followed the leader.The Gnocchi with truffle cream was absolutely delicious! \\n\\nThe Broccoli Gratin was also tasty. And, the ambiance was the best: we got to watch girls line up to flirt with Pauly D. What a meal!",
        "Great little independent place. The owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking. When in town I try to eat there a few times a month. I don't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly. They have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu. Its hard not to find something you will like.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",

A couple times we had off days the food was just ok but it still nocked most places out of the water. Way to go Nicks we love ya",
        "Love this place! BEST AND COLDEST BEERS in Vegas! It is my (and my husband's) new favorite place to watch sports! And who doesn't love an AWESOME cold beer while watching your favorite sports team?! Their hot wings are great, hamburgers are super yummy, flavorful, and juicy. We've been here at least 3 times in the last week...especially since it's hockey playoff season! ;)",

        "My first time here and I will be back! I was craving mad Greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews. Far better than the mad Greek! It tastes so fresh and if you're like me and enjoy REAL food you'll love this place. Just look at the picture",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "This location is alright. Most of the staff members are actually quite nice, and they've made my many experiences here enjoyable and easy. I just wish they had just as much items as Costco :( Other than that, this place is alright. It can get crowded a little and sometimes not a lot of check out places are open, so lines are long. \\n\\nI'd still shop around here, since it's the nearest location.",
        "Came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday, the layout of the club is nice but the place is too packed, lots of older folks and couples as well. as far as the music goes it was okay but I left after 30 minutes.  Waste of 30 dollars in my opinion.",
        "I am torn between three and four stars on this one. The food is decent but the portions are a little small for these prices. The small portions are somewhat offset by the various side dishes that are included in many of the menu items. I also appreciate how several of the menu items are healthy. The food itself was quite good but thats not saying much because I have never had terrible greek food before. They also have a decent patio which is a plus in my book.",
        "Had a TB shots because I accidentally poked myself with the same syringe I used to inject my roommates dog with insulin and had a panic attack! Thought I had caught rabies or something crazy!\\n\\nCame here and was seen right away. Staff was friendly and alert. Place was clean with a HUGE waiting area. The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",
        "Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.  \\nThe drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.",

        "I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!",
        "my friend and I tried two different tasting menu there. Generally it was good, but just felt a little bit over priced. I paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of Rose and tip, tax. If you never tried any modern mixture of French and Japanese cuisine, I would recommend it.",

Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",

It wasn't my cup of tea either.\\nNote that the wallpaper is hideous and their decorations consist of chili peppers dangling from the wall.",
        "Got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious. I thought it was actually pretty big for a small, but would be good for sharing. Also got a thai iced tea with boba. The boba has great consistency and tastes just right.",
        "The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \\\"no chocolate shake.\\\" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!",
        "Saw a boxing match here.  No complaints.  The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",
        "Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also. \\nSake bomb, anyone? :-)",
        "I loved the atmosphere and food.. Yummy..",
        "Had lunch here with some people from work and as always its great.  The service was a little slow, but what isnt in Vegas.  \\nI had the Grilled Shrimp Salad with a extra shrimp.  It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone..",
        "No longer has hookah :( A friend of mine wanted to go to chill at a hookah lounge we tried calling before we went but didn't get an answer.  So we said we would just try it since it was in Green valley casino which is down the street from me. When we got there the atmosphere was nice live singer but not what we were looking for. \\nI also felt like something was biting me when I was sitting on the couches.",
        "Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.",
        "Great sushi!  Great service. Great atmosphere. They have real nice private seating that you should try out for date night. \\n   Also - the 100%best shrimp sauce !",
        "The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",
        "Great Food \\nFunky Atmosphere\\nFriendly Servers",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",
        "The meatballs are amazing. The entrees are great. Interesting, delicious cocktails. Nice atmosphere. The service was good and the staff friendly. It's a great place for a date night or just a satisfying, delicious dinner.",
        "This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly",
        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts.",
        "Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.",
        "Had dinner on 05/02/08; we had no reservations and just walked in, which made it a plus. The service was great, the decor and atmosphere made it fun, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesome..definately recommend these two!",
        "Love this place! BEST AND COLDEST BEERS in Vegas! It is my (and my husband's) new favorite place to watch sports! And who doesn't love an AWESOME cold beer while watching your favorite sports team?! Their hot wings are great, hamburgers are super yummy, flavorful, and juicy. We've been here at least 3 times in the last week...especially since it's hockey playoff season! ;)",
        "My first time here and I will be back! I was craving mad Greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews. Far better than the mad Greek! It tastes so fresh and if you're like me and enjoy REAL food you'll love this place. Just look at the picture",
        "The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!",
        "Food portions were gigantic and flavorless. Service was absolutely despicable. The server was sitting there texting on her phone, charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a tea-bag, and I was just sitting there, staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows, wishing I could have gone to Wild Thaiger.",
        "Great selection of toppings and yogurt! Super clean friendly atmosphere the only place I will get yogurt from.  Do yourself a favor and go get some!",
        "I've been working out at CrossFit Max Effort for about a 3 days now and I love the place. Great Facility and very Knowledgeable Instructors. I like a family atmosphere and here that's what you get. Everbody wants you to succeed in all of your goals , its more than just a work out. CrossFit is not for everyone but if you wanna see what your made of start here.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.",
        "Big portions, good flavor, great prompt service, great price.  Pancakes  than IHOP, waffles better than Waffle House, French toast better than...making it yourself.  Will be back.",
        "Stuffed bacon cheeseburger with pretzel bun was great!! The atmosphere was good but it was a little warmer than what I feel is comfortable. Service was average. Overall, a good experience, will likely go back at some point.",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)",
        "Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.",
        "Wonderful!  The food, service & atmosphere are great.  Miso carbonara is so good without the richness.  Deserts are excellent we had the tiaramisou.  Next time we try the creme brulee.  The staff is gracious and friendly.  We will be back.",
        "Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. \\n\\nThe Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). \\n\\nThe salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!",
        "This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les \\u00c9clusiers should be a blip on your radar.",

        "If you're a barbecue fan, this is the place for you.  Get the little pig if you're a beginner, its a good intro to BBQ.  The atmosphere is great, and on a sunny day there is no better place to grab a beer (specially on work lunch break - wink wink).  Parking can be a challenge at time but nothing too concerining.",

        "This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price.",
        "Great new location. I am excited they moved closer to us. Always the best sandwiches in Surprise.",
        "Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market.",

        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \\\"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\\\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.",
        "Great food & atmosphere",

        "Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare.",
        "Great service, very friendly. Amazing beer list and great food.  Very relaxing atmosphere. Great place to get lunch and talk.",
        "Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "Located in a very run-down strip mall, if you're going to go you have to be prepared for the hole-in-the-wall place that this is. When I was there, there was only one employee in the place (Noon on a Thursday). And they had no customers. The guy was nice, took my order and cooked it up. Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",

The scientist pizza was fabulous !!!\\n\\nUpdate - We went back for more and thoroughly enjoyed the The Simple Margherita Finished with Wild Arugula and Shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Consistently great!",
        "Great food and great WINE. Awesome pasta, the description matched exactly what I got. When I asked the waiter to describe the wine I wanted to order, he described it to a T. What was just supposed to be a small appetizer and a drink turned into a meal. Very elegant, very nice, VERY GOOD!",
        "Always has been a favorite! The management and staff have always been great and do whatever to keep you happy! There is not one bad food item on the menu and everything tastes so good it makes it hard to decide. Their Buffalo Mac and cheese is great, also a fan of their pretzel too. Also all the beer options will keep anyone satisfied.",

        "The SoHo Gourmet food cart is so yummy. The So Chick dumplings are my favorite. The salads compliment the dumplings very well. Love that new rice boxes are being offered this year. I had a sample of the rice today. It was really good. I knew I should gotten out earlier.",
        "Have come here a couple of times and it will be our go-to now.They have a fantastic happy hour, quality-wise and price-wise. The place is prettier on the inside than the outside and it's easy to miss. Has been pretty quiet when we've been in, around 4 pm on weekdays. Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!",
        "Excellent experience. Sharon upgraded my already upgraded room.  Next thing I knew, doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine.  Also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything I want along with $120 in breakfast certificate.  \\n\\nAll this is thanks to American Express card.",
        "In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess.",
        "Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",
        "They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home.  The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake.  Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No.  Not even an apology.",
        "Been there several times.   Greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Servers took orders quickly and knew the menu well.   Specials were related and all questions answered.\\n\\nFood served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.\\n\\nService seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently.",
        "OMG!  My boss took me here for lunch.  You order and pay for your order 1st.  The hamburgers were to die for.  The fries were very good and flavorful.  Fried twinkee is what we got for dessert.  I loved the whole meal and will bring family and friends back for sure.  I will take pictures next time so you can see how much you get for your money.  You will NOT be disapointed.",
        "We stopped here on the way to the airport and it was pretty lame!  It was HH without a bartender - WTF? Our server was slow as a snail and got yelled at by the manager.  Also, he forgot our drinks.  And our sushi sat at the bar foreeevvverrrr before he picked it up.\\n\\nOur rolls had too much sauce on it and weren't cut all the way through.  UGH.",
        "Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \\n\\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\\n\\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.",
        "Smoothie King is like a broke Jamba Juice! When I came here it was packed with loads of people and the staff here are far from good customer service. The way it is set up makes no sense what so ever. When it was time to pay the guy ringing us up got our order wrong and wanted me to $18.00 for two smoothies..overall smoothies were good but don't think i would go back ever again.",
        "Dude, LAX sucks.  It's like a hallway packed with sweaty old men, plus a balcony with more sweaty old men staring down.\\n\\nThey have absolutely no line system.  That just packs everyone into the \\\"waiting area\\\" until someone pushes and shoves their way through the entrance and slips the bouncer a twenty.\\n\\nI know it's Vegas and I have to lower my standards, but LAX just sucks donkey balls.  Sweaty ones.  Gross.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "I came here for a staycation and couldn't be happier. The room is fabulous and the hotel exceeds my expectations.  Food court is a hot mess. Eat before you get here.",
        "Sat around for 15 min a guy came around to ask us to drink... Gave us water and took forever to even come by to ask what we wanted fuck this shit no good service what so ever",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "it rocked!!! Their version of a BLT was out if this world from the bread to the avacado oh my. a might messy to EAT but well worth the post eats hand scrubbing",
        "Bad service. Got both of my coffee orders wrong and my food order. Lady was rude on the intercom and they took 20 min. This is just another reason why Starbucks does so well.. Always great customer service and your order is always right. Maybe this place should learn a few things from them!!!!",
        "Not too impressed.  The service was so-so and no one helped us with how to do this.  At previous Mongolian places I had put the sauce in the bowl.  The cook yelled at me for doing this saying it would all cook away (?) He made me get more in the little cup and it ended up so strong I could hardly eat it.  The atmosphere is sorta cold.  Idk...we just didnt care for it much =(",
        "I been going to this Walmart for the pass six years. I am sick and tired that this Walmart never has anything in stock and is messy! I can drive an extra 10 minutes to the one located at Ft Apache and W.Tropicana Ave and they have everything in stock and it's organized. I'm done with this place!!",
        "If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well. I love to get the chicken bowl because their burritos are too big and messy. I'd never had a problem with this place and they always give great customer service.",
        "A friend recommended this place while I was visiting Madison. I was hesitant because it's a chain but she highly recommended. I regret not just yelping for an Italian restaurant in Madison. The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned....I'll stick to yelping restaurants.",
        "This so bad! My husband and I walked in ordered a beer, hot tea and nachos without beans. 20 minutes later we get the nachos with beans so my husband asked if we could get them without from a different server because our server went on break. The manager came over and was so rude and blamed everyone else for the mistake. Because of the management I would never go back. He yelled at the bartender for trying to help us with our order!",
        "These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "The guy working there was nice.\\nTheir food is not great at all.\\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "Great selection of beers from a variety of micro-breweries. We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)",
        "Really rude service. The bartenders upstairs accidentally poured us three gin and sodas. When we went back to say we had asked for gin and tonics, she insisted we'd said soda and refused to change them. Seriously, who t f orders gin and sodas? That on top of another rude (though shirtless and pretty) waiter. Never again!",
        "I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!",
        "My family and I tried this for the first time about a week ago. The food was unique, and very good for adults, but my kids freaked out about it. They had very unique draft beers and unusual drink choices.  It was a little Spendey, but we really enjoyed the change.  Great happy hour prices and happy hour every day of the week.",
        "Probably one of the coolest bars in Madison. Quirky without being pretentious, laid back without being soporific. Fantastic beer selection and really friendly staff.",
        "Their prices are getting out of control.  FOR SALAD?  Dudes, your dinner prices are getting exorbitant.  At these rates, the \\\"premium\\\" items like the proteins should be included with the meal.   Sorry Sweet Tomatoes, you just priced yourself out of the ballpark.  Back to SouperSald.  Just crazy lately!!!",
        "Absolutely terrible!!! I waited for 20 minutes to even get soaked for my pedi and then after an hour had passed and no one came to attend to me I just asked for a towel and left. I can't believe I wasted an hour just sitting there soaking my feet expecting that the lady would come and work on my nails. Do no go here, period!",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Awful. Did I say awful? This place is a real LV stinker. Over hype, overpriced, over full of itself. Whatever you do, don't order fish. I thought the place in Beverly Hills was over the top - with a view of the driveway and unloading vans and limos. Really, a mess in progress.",
        "Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \\\"how would X compare to X?\\\"  Answer: \\\"It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\\\"  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience.",
        "Love me some Yogurtology! Great selection of flavors, most of which are Gluten-free for my darling Celiac boy. They also have the toppings segregated from each other and very clearly labeled. So my seven year old had no trouble distinguishing which ones were safe for him to pile on. We all got different flavors but the stand out was chocolate/coconut swirl. It was divine like a frozen Mounds bar. Worth every penny!",
        "I had a great time at Houdini's Magic Shop. The clerk was very helpful and answered all of my questions. He was a practicing magician too which helped a lot. He really knew his stuff!",
        "I'd been wanting a tattoo detailing a concept from my favorite all time book series, The Wheel of Time. I knew Tone's work from a friend of mine and he did an absolutely beautiful job with freehand detailing that is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!!",
        "terrible service, food wasn't even decent, prices were average. I think the only type of ethnic food was the Mexican food. and pretty cool that they have their own name beer. was alright.\\n\\n\\nI wish I knew this place sucked so badly before even thinking of coming here.",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it.",
        "The food was not memorable.  The service was lousy.  My husband and I were seated and our order was not taken for just over a half hour. We sat there and watched as other groups/individuals were seated and had their orders taken before us.  We kept trying to get our waitresses attention and had no success for quite awhile. We should have just walked out. But we stayed, eventually ordered and had an o.k. meal.",
        "Such a cool place! Stopped in for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Even got a free appetizer for checking in! Split an order of delicious calamari followed by a lobster roll. The roll was messy but worth it. Would definitely return and recommend to friends.",
        "Btreakfast was good. Not great, but good. we did eat there 3 times for breakfast last week while in vegas. However, Tuesday night is seafood night and I would not recommend it. very poor buffet for dinner, especially when my mother came back to the tabel and told me she saw a guy about twenty something years old touching the food with his hands. beware!",
        "Suggestions :\\n\\nBook an Appointment. \\nHave a lowered car?  \\nDefinetely book an appointment in advance. \\n\\nAndre was honest when I got in. He said he would try to squeeze me into their time slot. Dealership quality service at a small shop location. Will probably do my major work at this location.",
        "So I order a taco salad and there were nats in it.  Is that not some kinda health code violation? I was so grossed out I instantly got sick and threw it away. Maybe it was my fault for trying to eat at a place of boulder highway. My usual experiences at del taco is good and so is the food, but because of the experience I will think twice before  going back.",
        "Dont EVER go to the vietnameses guy name JOHN!!!! I went in for long layers and left with most of my hair cut off and it looks like a freaking Mullet!!! Wth.. Thats not long layers!!! He doesnt listen and I will never recommend this guy to even cut my dogs hair!!!",
        "THIS PLACE WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN!!! Over priced flavorless Dim Sum( and I've had some shitty Dim Sum in my life) The portions were very pricey and minuscule. I could tell the server knew I didn't like my food and then she proceeded to avoid my table out of fear I guess. Either way don't go here unless you don't mind wasting time and taste buds.",
        "These donuts were the bomb! I had eaten one and a half donuts before I knew what was happening...I was in heaven! Of course I went with chocolate, but I had part of the buttermilk donut, which is to die for! Got to check this place out! I just wish they had one in my state!",
        "Waiter! There are pubes in my fruit cup.\\n\\nThought the pineapple tasted fishy. No, like actual fucking fish. It tasted like a fish in my mouth. Then I found a pube on my cantaloupe.

        "alright seriously.. my friends and I are going through the drive thru, not only is there a guy standing out in the 108 (not lying) degree temp, but then there's another guy running to my car window to get payment to make the transaction as fast as possible. I have never had someone run for fast food like that. good job chick fil-a, you made us feel like rockstars.",
        "so basic. so loud. so dark. so packed. ugh and regulars sitting on the bar? really? like, 2 dudes, literally SITTINGG on the bar. i dont care who youre \\\"bro\\\" is, im trying to get a drink here. take off your too cool metal mulisha tee and let someone else enjoy a song or two .. before i get the heck out of here.",
        "The worst place to buy cigarettes do not shop here the owner is a nasty human being. They think they are doing you a favor by you shopping in its store. If you enjoy being treated like crap and yelled at than  shop here because you get plenty of abuse here.  And for some strange reason they always want you to pay in cash",
        "I must have caught them on a baaaddd day because all I have to say is \\\"YUCK\\\" and waste of money with their chewy food. Felt like I walked in to a gas station and ordered chewing gum.  Overpriced for the quality of food.  Threw 90% of it away.",
        "Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch.",

I have never had it before because I have always had a hard time choosing that over the delicious looking pastries.  Best Part.. Jean Phillipe Maury was standing in the hall across from the Chocolate Fountain talking with another chef... no one knew it was him :)",

My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "I got $0.99 problems but the Tuesday deal from Popeyes ain't one. 99 cents for two pieces of chicken hits the spot once in a while and Popeyes always come through.

Their chicken seems to be consistent  and  service is average for a drive thru place.",

The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",

Its hard not to find something you will like.",

Even then, I would probably go to Bangkok Ocha!",

        "Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!",
        "I'm in town for an hour saw this place on line before we left Angel Fire.  Chef John Murphy is outstanding not only regarding the meal but in regards to excellent customer service as well. Enjoyed it immensity and will be back later this week. Thanks John! !!!",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!",
        "Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!",
        "They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now",
        "Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \\\"best pizza in US\\\" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour.",
        "Called around and no one could beat this places offer. Quick service and phone looks like brand new. Will go again if I have too (hope I don't have to). They have my business going forward with my products. Thanks and keep it up.",
        "We had so much fun! My son ordered the best Red Velvet pancakes ever with cream cheese syrup, whipped cream and chocolate shavings! I loved my cheese and green chile omelette with side of Banana Cream Pie pancakes. The service was friendly and atmosphere casual and cool! Definitely worth driving over from the strip and a favorite new stop on our next trip to Vegas!",
        "Friendly staff and they try to make your wait short and comfortable while you wait for your car to be serviced.......One thing that would make it a bit nicer would be to have to drivers since they are driving us all over town to get home.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "I just called the Rolfs Salon at Gainey Village, what happened to Delores Leiva? Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "Can't beat their selection on children's clothing. I was commenting to an employee about the great finds for children's clothes and toys and she mentioned that's most of their donations. When I'm in town I'll make it a point to go there again.",
        "The food ain't what it used to be here. They've introduced a carvery but only one visit per person.",
        "We love going to Tivoli Village. We've been performing there for a few years now and every time they have been very gracious. We have our Camp Rocks! Summer Music Day Camp concert there this Friday, June 20th, at 6pm. We have 7 talented kids who will rock the stage after only 2 weeks together as a group. The concert is free and open to the public.",
        "This is a great place to bring out of towners who think Phoenix is a hubble of sand. The patio is wonderful, the food is terrific, and the staff is helpful and not too \\\"in your face fancy.\\\"\\nAlso- the wine list it to die for.\\nThanks for always making us have a good time, Lon's. You're a Phoenix, okay PV classic.",
        "This was disgusting ,me and my fiance both felt sick after eating at this place.. compared other Chinese buffets in town, the price was even more expensive than some of them..seriously some of the cheaper ones were better than this... i would advice everyone to avoid this place",
        "These guys rock! Perfect For your Mediterranean fix. Spanakopita, Tiropita and Chicken gyros have all been tried and loved. Have always gotten a friendly staff member whether in person or over the phone. Snappy delivery, too. Can't lose with this place.",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "Waste of money!  Had a great salesman on the phone who sold me into everything I would get....I asked very specific questions to make sure I was picking a place to fit my needs.  They have fancy machines but are completely unhelpful.  I give them a ZERO out of 5.",
        "I love Ross and I love a bargain, but why is this particular location almost always half empty? The racks look so sad! I try to check this place out often and it's always the same: half empty racks. This isn't the best Ross location in town so don't make a special trip to shop here. As with every Ross, checkout lines are ridiculously long.",
        "Purchased a voucher on Living Social and was hoping to have a good experience after reading reviews and doing some research on the internet. However it was far from that. I showed up for the appointment and was told it needed to be pushed back a little bit. I waited an hour and half at the salon. He just skipped out on the appointment. Failing to provide any communication via phone or text. Very unprofessional.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",
        "Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar.",
        "I really enjoyed my choice of black coffee here while my friends didn't. I just think they chose the wrong one. I got the one that was mixed with dark and light roast beans. I can't remember the name but it was delicious! No disgusting coffee aftertaste. All in all, I'd be back here and get the same coffee the next time I'm in town!",
        "The service takes forever... But they are nice... Obviously you must get the Frozen Hot Chocolate... Get it girrrrrrrrrrl",
        "Never again....I have tried this place twice now.  First time was a NYE party and now just to hang out and gamble.  Each time sucked!  I got suckered into bottle service for 500 bones and now just dropped 100 bucks at keno.  What a complete waste of time.  Also, why didn't anyone tell me there was a freakin loer yuppie convention in town???",
        "So delish! Every doughnut I have had has been absolutely amazing! My favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake",
        "Inexplicably Whole foods switched out their baked goods supplier and now they don't have decent chocolate or almond croissants anymore.   Now I have to go to Panera bread, Starbucks or the local bakeries.   Bad move, I hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this.",
        "Turns out the bug infested part was BED BUGS by the way!  Yes that's right BED BUGS!",
        "The food here is ok to good but varies a lot. Serving tables are set too hot as are the heat lamps so food that's fresh from the kitchen is better than stuff that's been sitting. Salad table is fine as are the deserts.  And in any case it's considerably better than what I've been eating in Beatty for the last two days.",
        "Love me some Yogurtology! Great selection of flavors, most of which are Gluten-free for my darling Celiac boy. They also have the toppings segregated from each other and very clearly labeled. So my seven year old had no trouble distinguishing which ones were safe for him to pile on. We all got different flavors but the stand out was chocolate/coconut swirl. It was divine like a frozen Mounds bar. Worth every penny!",
        "white chocolate raspberry - ftw!!!!!!!!",
        "I really enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere here.  My mom and I ate here for restaurant week and its was delicious.  The blackened brie is a definite winner as is the decadent hot chocolate dessert.  All the staff were very attentive and I also liked how the managers showed an involvement in the restaurant which is something you do not see all the time. Will defintely be going back.",
        "So good! We stopped in for a couple scoops of ice cream and were not disappointed. The toasted coconut is delicious. It's creamy, flavorful, and I thought the serving size was fair. The Vietnamese coffee was also great. If you're a coffee fan, I highly suggest trying it.\\n\\nThe shop is really cute with lots of candy for sale. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.",
        "Chicken schwarma here is fantastic. Best in town. Don't add onions though. Pita chips and hummus are also great.",
        "Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\\n\\n\\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00.",
        "Delicious!!!!! They have the best Falafels in town and the hummus is great too! The services is great despite it being packed all the time. Seating is limited so I would recommend getting your food to go. I think they should expand!!!!!!",
        "It's not a bad hotel, just dont expect too much from it. I was actually surprised that it's so quiet in the rooms even though the casino is right outside the door.  The AC unit doesn't get very cold (might of just been my room), beds are pretty comfortable. My only real complaint would be that the curtains don't cover the window completely, so the morning sun is right in my face, though nothing a pillow fort can't handle!",
        "I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of. All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.  After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it. I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it.",
        "It's okay.  The room was clean and the bed was comfy.  The staff was friendly and the food was good and affordable.\\n\\nIt's a bit old and the rooms are stuffy.  I hated walking through the lobby with everyone smoking.  It's pretty far down the strip.\\n\\nNot the worst place I've ever stayed, and it was reasonably priced ($69/night).",
        "Terrible customer service- did not answer their phone when I called for the status of my truck. I was quoted one price and charged more. Never called when my vehicle was done- would not recommend this place to anyone!!!",
        "This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!",
        "DO NOT use this pharmacy!  These people are incompetent, especially the \\\"manager\\\" Jerry who does not even return customer phone calls.  It has been 3 days and many, many phone calls and I still do not have my Rx.  I will never use this pharmacy again.  Don't waste your time...find a different compounding pharmacy!",
        "These donuts were the bomb! I had eaten one and a half donuts before I knew what was happening...I was in heaven! Of course I went with chocolate, but I had part of the buttermilk donut, which is to die for! Got to check this place out! I just wish they had one in my state!",
        "Was super excited to enjoy shaved snow in my neighborhood but that excitement quickly diminished after one taste.  Overly priced and not worth the cost.  I'll continue to drive to China Town for some yummy shaved snow.",
        "Listen, if you know anything about donuts. This is the best in town. Not no commercially made crap. Made fresh everyday by the same person. If that's not dedication. I don't know what is. They sell out everyday then they close. That in my opinion means something also. Like I said best donuts in town hands down.",
        "Just left Vegas Lash Lounge and my lashes look AMAZING!!!! The shop is just as amazing with a contemporary look and a fantastic staff couldn't have asked for a better experience! Run don't walk see what you're missing!",
        "For a drive through coffee, very very slow. You would be quicker running into Starbucks. As for the coffee, if they get your order correct the quality of the drinks will very. The iced mocha has un-dissolved chocolate powder in it and the other drinks can range from weak to too \\nsweet. Try once, but consider other options for quick good drive through coffee. Sorry Talebu",
        "Tried to make delivery over the phone, girl could not understand me when giving my address. I would give numbers, she would rearrange the numbers, get my apartment number confused with my street number. gave up and hung up.",
        "This place was amazing, best AYCE in town! The customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil Asian waitress working haha. The Sex Bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered!  Definitely coming back soon!",
        "Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart.",
        "Tried various locations of Lindo around town, just not impressed. Just standard fare, with inflated prices.",
        "I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!",
        "Came down from Flagstaff after Grandaughter's commencement and tried to find a place that could accommodate a large party(about 20) Uncle sams had no problem. We walked in and were seated almost immediately and the two servers assigned to us were attentive and patient. Pizza and wings were excellent and, out of all the people there, there were no complaints. Prices were fair. Definetely recommend for your next get-together.",
        "I go here every year for my birthday. It's amazing! I first tried fondue in Switzerland and this place is better! Bring your appetite and save room for the chocolate fondue portion. Pricey, but worth it!",
        "This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together."

        "I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",
        "Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!",
        "Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "This place serves the best burger I have ever had. It's a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food. No weaknesses.\\n\\nGo for the Delux Burger with sweet taters (and extra helpings of aioli).",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy....",
        "Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!",
        "Grass fed burger! And four types of bloody Mary's!",
        "I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.",
        "Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint , clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. \\n\\nOh well, onto the next burger joint.",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",
        "saw the show tonight and it was ok ..dont expect anything spectacular but it is worth the 10.00 you pay at gold star for it.  all the seats are pretty good but kind of a run down theatre but manageable. Jokes arent all that funny but hey they are trying and the show is a pretty low budget show.. But for the money it will most likely entertain you.",
        "The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision.",

Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.",

Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",

We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.

It's utterly necessary that you try this place, especially the sweet potato fries! Pictures on my blog.",

The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",

I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",

The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.  \\nThe drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.",
        "This caf\\u00e9, conveniently situated opposite McGill, is a very good addition to the downtown scene. The coffee is excellent, and the owner Jason and his colleagues provide friendly service. The pastries, which come from a small bakery in the east end, are delicious (think muffins like mother used to make). I drop in as often as I can.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.",
        "The decor and vibe are way classier than the Peoria location, however the service is a bit lacking. It's large, clean, and has indoor and outdoor seating, but it definitely is suited for the Old Town Scottsdale crowd. Their menu is pricier and more upscale than the Peoria location, as well.",
        "this has got to be the best, most amazing little  coffee place i've ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco!! wish we had this in boston...",
        "The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\n*I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf.",
        "Took 30 minutes for a beer however the burger was excellent!  Staff was very friendly and apologized for the delayed beer and was very good about recovering from the mishap.  We came back the following morning for breakfast.  Again slow service and a slightly less friendly staff.  Oh well.",
        "The burger was great and we had excellent customer service. Friday's are very busy. This is a great place for families.",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.",
        "Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!",
        "Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. \\n\\nThe Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). \\n\\nThe salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!",
        "This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les \\u00c9clusiers should be a blip on your radar.",
        "A good burger and the best regular and sweet potato fries in PHX; however you need to provide good service.  The service is not as good as either Indulge, Zinburger or The Grind, and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods.  The food is very consistent; parking can be a bit difficult.",
        "Awesome bulgogi tacos! Chef didn't have Kim chi so he whipped up some Asian slaw for my friend. I had the New Mexico burger w/garlic fries, which were delicious! Brought home a pastrami sandwich w/garlic fries for the hubby. They must have been good because the only crumbs left were the ones on his shirt! Will definitely be back!",
        "Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.",
        "This used to be a drive up coffee shop. Now the serve great food and the best damn lemon drop martinis that they serve in huge glasses. Staff is very friendly. Wish I wasn't moving to Scottsdale, will probably not make it back here.",
        "The close-to-my-childhood-home Starbucks: it's A. Not Peet's, and B. An accidental high school reunion when I dare to venture in. On the other hand, there are usually couches--or chairs and tables--available, inside or outside, depending on the season.\\n\\nThis is the option when I don't want to try to park on Beverly for a caffeine fix at the Coffee Tree.",
        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.",
        "I guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others. And what makes Mandalay Bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach. Kick back relax enjoy the water and the live DJ music.",
        "I come here every morning for my coffee and bagel.  They know my order and are SUPER friendly.  It's not the closest D&D to my house, but this is the one I go to for their service.",
        "Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect.",
        "Great addition to the neighborhood.  Good food & coffee. I wish they had longer hours because I like to eat lunch at 3:30. Or a mid afternoon tea & pastry.",
        "Cool burger place at the Mirage!",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "My favorite burger. Very good. Thick and juicy. Yum.! Also big selections of meats and toppings and even bread",
        "Burgers look great but been here 22 min and still waiting for fries and the place is dead with a ton of staff. Hope the burgers are worth it.... They were. The burgers were amazing and so were the fries. 3 stars because the wait was horrible.",
        "Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.",
        "I know and love L.A area pastrami and this place is ok for the high prices. The over price burgers are ok.  They have coke products advertised on menu but only carry Pepsi products. I will not be returning, I will save my cravings for when I go visit L.A",
        "Great coffee!\\nGreat atmosphere!\\nGreat service!\\nSo glad I found this place. Wish I was local.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "Great location right in the middle of the casino! Regular Starbucks coffee at jacked up prices but hey this is Vegas!",
        "Beat the heat and head to Jump 'n' Jungle. Feeling stir crazy and want to release some pent up energy, go to Jump 'n' Jungle. On your way home from school and you want to interact with your friends and children, meet up at Jump 'n' Jungle. Two for Tuesdays are a budget friendly activity.\\nNote: Pack clean socks for children and adults. Shoe-free environment and socks are required for everyone.",
        "I went here to use a Groupon and had a couple of beers and a burger.  Right off the bat the bartender mispronounced Smithwicks.  Not a great sign.  The beer was cold and the service was friendly so I really can't complain.  Good neighborhood place in Southern Highlands.\\n\\nThe burger was an average bar burger, but was large enough to take half home for later.  If I lived closer I would go back for sure.",
        "Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken",
        "Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",
        "Been coming to this burger joint for over 20 years - back when it was in Scottsdale. Each summer we travel to the PHX area to stay for a couple weeks... Every year we come here at least once. In all those years I have never had a bad experience. Burgers are always spot on, delicious, and fresh. Great character, too! Love the Chuck Box!",
        "This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place.",
        "The Best Burger I have had in Las Vegas!!!!",
        "They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.",
        "Used to have to come here to pick up coffee for my lazy boss but after switching jobs realized I was right next door and have now been coming every day for nearly a year. \\n\\nWard and Monica are great. They will let you try stuff, explain coffee stuff, and recommend stuff. \\n\\nEveryone loves the kale but the stalker and squashed mango are my favorites.",
        "Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "We gave this place a try for breakfast and dinner, and were disappointed both times. The breakfast experience was terrible- extremely slow service, ran out of coffee, food came out wrong, took 10 minutes to get hot sauce while over cooked eggs got cold. Food was way over priced, especially for dinner.",
        "We got these donuts and coffee for our house work day.\\nIt was fantastic. I loved the one filled with cream. Definitely get a dozen and one of each..  I cant choose a favorite but getting this for our sunday was the best idea we had...",
        "I thought I saw how awesome these sanwhiches were on the Travel Channel. I ordered the #2. It was very bland. Burger was dry and fries had almost no taste. I never add salt to my meals but this one needed it. It wasn't until later that I found out that the Pastrami was the one to order. Good service great prices and Pitt atmosphere.",
        "Besides pizzerias, this is one of our favorite kid friendly places to eat while in Mesa, AZ. The burgers, fries and shakes just hit the spot (like In n Out back home). The seating situation at this location is way better than the location in Mesa, AZ.",
        "This place is a valley institution. Bring cash. Don't feed the pigeons. Outdoor seating but misters help cool in the summer. Their fish is an acquired taste so I understand some of the negative reviews. My wife hates it so I eat here by myself. (She is not a local anyway).  I recommend the 4 piece fish and chips with an extra 2 oz special sauce. I have been eating here since I was a kid and hope to be eating here well into my retirement.",
        "Tried the clubhouse burger.  YUCK,  the flavors don't blend, the bun tasted weird, too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich, long story short didn't like.  Gave it a thumbs down to manager, who seemed un interested when I told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased.",
        "This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour.",
        "Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure."

Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",

Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it - share, the portion is HUUUUGEE.\\n\\nThis place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",
        "I'm not sure what the hype is all about. We had the chicken & waffles, duck confit poutine, and a BLT. The BLT and poutine were both fine / mediocre. For me, the chicken and waffles with mustard seeds in the syrup was revolting. The decor and staff here are cool, but I regret eating here.",

I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "I love this place for dinner.  A very nice variety.  Service has always been good for me and the portions are huge.    I would tend to stay away from seafood here though.  I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",
        "The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.",
        "Everything was AWSOME. I got the famous chicken and waffles with a Bloody Mary.

Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.",

I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",
        "The tacos are terrible. The shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco.  Customer service is a nightmare!",
        "Love this place, has great equipment and flavors! And great customer service. Everyone is so helpful and the staff knows what they are talking about and the place is very clean",
        "I would like to share my experience at Discount Tires on W Azure, got the best customer service from the time I pulled up up in my car from the time I left. It took them 30 minutes to get me back on the road, and I got a \\\"GREAT DEAL\\\" on my tires, feel like I am in a new car, I will recommend this location, great customer service, Thanks Rob your the best.",
        "I will give this place 5 stars, reason being is the contacted me to correct my mistake post. I did on the wrong Resturant. I appreciate owners that follow up\\nOn comments or customer experience. I do frequent vegas every couple months and I will  come here to eat, once again thank you for being understanding of my mistake. look forward to trying the Resturant out.",
        "The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.",
        "Love it!!! Looks real divey from the outside and way small. Inside, total tiki tradition! Salty but sweet bartendress, cheap drinks guaranteed to get you wasted. Get a drink in a mug, they're worth it!!",
        "Took my mother to him for a fractured wrist. He said he wasn't sure if it was fractured and to come back in two weeks. Went to another doctor and it was fractured and they put a hard cast on it. We were sent there by Sante Rehab Center. Maybe they are in cahoots??",
        "Never again! If you're trying to reschedule a hotel pick up, you're wasting your time and your money. Customer service sucks. You would do better to take the public bus system. Not only is it easier and more direct, it's a lot more inexpensive.",
        "My friend is Siclian and for years I could only eat italian food when I went to his place cause of how good and authentic. Right down to the homemade vodka sauce.  The egg plant parm here is amazing.  With the proper distribution of cheese through out the whole meal.  This is my new spot, best italian in Vegas off the strip guarantee!!",
        "They fill this place in past max capacity where it literally is like walking on top of another person just to get anywhere. Even to get back in from outside you have to wait in another line because they have to wait for people to exit first. These people need to be more about customer service instead of money hungry thieves.",
        "Smoothie King is like a broke Jamba Juice! When I came here it was packed with loads of people and the staff here are far from good customer service. The way it is set up makes no sense what so ever. When it was time to pay the guy ringing us up got our order wrong and wanted me to $18.00 for two smoothies..overall smoothies were good but don't think i would go back ever again.",
        "Terrible attitude towards customers",
        "Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "first time my family and i have eaten at this restaurant and i really did enjoy the atmosphere, food and customer service. The food portions are filling so if you can try to hold back from eating up all of the yummy appetizers, lol. Can't wait to come back in the near future.",
        "The Sales clerks at the gun counter are very rude and act as though you are a nuisance if you ask a question. I have had several interactions with different clerks and the culture they have developed in my observation is one that they dont need customers, customers need them.  I really enjoy sportsmans and the products they offer. I sincerely hope that things get better with their staff.",
        "Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!",
        "This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic",
        "I didn't have a room here, just came to gamble/drink. Southpoint is nice refresher to keep away from the crowds and people from the strip. Mostly local people here and i like how they are quick with the beers at the video poker at the center bar. I will definitely come back here...",
        "Wackness defined. Twenty bucks for food that makes T.G.I.Friday's look like it deserves a Michelin star. Even for an airport this place is overpriced and not worth a stop. The service was decent, but that was the only redeeming quality whatsoever about this place. Avoid.",
        "It's ok. First time customer and they got my order wrong. Waited over 20 mins. Finally got my order and had to add sugar to a latte? No way. Not going again.",
        "Our new favorite ice cream spot! With kronuts!!  Super friendly service, very clean place and very accommodating to our kids who wanted to sample all kinds of flavors.  And their recommendations were on point!  Happy customer who'll be coming back for more!",
        "Bad service. Got both of my coffee orders wrong and my food order. Lady was rude on the intercom and they took 20 min. This is just another reason why Starbucks does so well.. Always great customer service and your order is always right. Maybe this place should learn a few things from them!!!!",
        "I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.",
        "The employees spend too\\nMuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service!",
        "Their products, service and prices are phenomenal. Their product prices got my business and their prompt and courteous customer service and amazing product quality will keep me coming back. I know that once my order is placed I don't need to worry - it will done correctly and on time!",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction",
        "Surprisingly the flavor for the broth is great for a bowl of pho . Most places is pretty bland ... They have great customer service . Food came out fast . No complaints . Great place to enjoy a bowl of pho .",
        "I been going to this Walmart for the pass six years. I am sick and tired that this Walmart never has anything in stock and is messy! I can drive an extra 10 minutes to the one located at Ft Apache and W.Tropicana Ave and they have everything in stock and it's organized. I'm done with this place!!",
        "If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well. I love to get the chicken bowl because their burritos are too big and messy. I'd never had a problem with this place and they always give great customer service.",
        "Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.",
        "Horrible customer service skills. Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment. \\nWon't go back to this location.",
        "I had a great lunch at Whole Foods today! I went looking for something they do not stock anymore :( and ended up eating a surprise lunch. I had an \\\"ok\\\" sandwich but my significant other had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was AMAZING. I probably could have eaten 3 of them! I was pleasantly surprised. It was good, fast, and not too expensive!",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "This place is super sketchy! \\n\\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night.",
        "People and company make mistakes. \\nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \\n\\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!",
        "stopped here because we were starvingggg. overpriced. horrible customer service and not so great food. I ordered the cured meat sandwich, it was mediocre and basic nothing special. \\ndefinitely wouldnt recommend this place.",
        "Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)",
        "I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!",
        "Big crooks liars people Jim is the  biggest  thief .he charge for parts that not need to be fix or replacement .watch out people from this place .",
        "I didn't have any coupons so paid 7.49 plus tax for this place.  I was pretty happy until I went to Main Street Cafe and paid 7.99 for three times the variety of food.  However, if you gots the coupon, then Paradise might be your bet.  I could really only find chicken worth eating...oh and a few items from the dessert area.",
        "This place blows.  Staff doesn't have a clue about customer service, (except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio).  Food was blah.  Spring rolls with out Thai basil, seriously? Pho was alright, but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoiled.\\n\\nHorrible, no. Below average, yes."

        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!",
        "While vacationing in Vegas I decided to stop here before coming back home.  As a Peruvian am always questionable if the food is going to be good.  This place shut me the heck up!!! HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.",
        "Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!",
        "Super awesome event. They managed to cater to my veggie needs. The set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the Moscatohad to be the strongest ever. We loved it, the first two dishes win the others no so much. One person said they could see they're reflection in the cheese!!!  Yikes",
        "Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.",
        "Went climbing here about 4 months ago and used their rented shoes.... Left with a minor blister-like object on my 2nd toe and to this day I still have it.... if you can, BRING YOUR OWN SHOES... unless you want some nasty looking growth on your toe :/",
        "The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.",
        "Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.",
        "Super fun! Great artists and teachers. Good equipment, clean establishment, helpful staff and lots of paintings to choose from. Had a blast! Will definitely be coming back!",
        "As everything else in Vegas, The Venetian is like a kid's idea of Venice, but then on crack.\\nSo... Palazzo suite, nice but super cheesey. I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",
        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "These guys rock. Fixed my i5 glass super fast. Nice clean friendly place. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",
        "Love this place! BEST AND COLDEST BEERS in Vegas! It is my (and my husband's) new favorite place to watch sports! And who doesn't love an AWESOME cold beer while watching your favorite sports team?! Their hot wings are great, hamburgers are super yummy, flavorful, and juicy. We've been here at least 3 times in the last week...especially since it's hockey playoff season! ;)",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",

        "Had a TB shots because I accidentally poked myself with the same syringe I used to inject my roommates dog with insulin and had a panic attack! Thought I had caught rabies or something crazy!\\n\\nCame here and was seen right away. Staff was friendly and alert. Place was clean with a HUGE waiting area. The shot hurt like a mother-trucket but apparently it's expected.",
        "I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\\n\\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!",
        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",
        "This place is now closed. Apparently they lost their liquor license and those of us who purchased a Yelp Deal for that place are stuck with a certificate we cannot use. Shame, because I heard so many great things about the food. RIP Antars.",
        "Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.",

        "One word. BOMB. 1st timer at a Greek mediterranean restaurant all though I had Gyros b4. Found out I been pronouncing it wrong this hole time but let's get to the point. Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way.",
        "I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "Food is really good but incredibly noisy.  Couldn't hear person next to me at our 4 top.",
        "Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.",

        "This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those.",

VEGAN options were fantastic! Drunken noodles was superb, vegan brownie sundae just lovely. Thanks Wazuzu and Steve Wynn for being vegan friendly!",

The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "soo good!!!!!!!!!! this is the 2nd cirque show i have seen and it did not disappoint! Not for the uptight or prude! :)",
        "It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \\\"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\\\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.",

Their fried chicken is so good.  The non-food items are generally more expensive than the evil super corporate mega grocery store.  Fry's will also multiply your coupons up to $1.",
        "Had a lot of fun dousing a few super-delicious strawberries and cream puffs at the chocolate fountain during the Yelp Rocks event Thursday night... I could've swam in that chocolate fountain bobbing for cream puffs all night, I tell ya!  \\n\\nHere's hoping S'Bistro will be present at the next rock-some party Gabi organizes!",
        "Food is Okay. Breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads and sandwiches were decent. Can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.",
        "This store is like a Mega store. Maybe they are a little bit over they head because sadly the meats are not the best. They have meat on sale for 3 and 4 bucks and its coloring is brown to black. Meat should be Red. I will shop here but I will stay away from the meat. If you can get pass that the store is really ok.",
        "I've only been here once and I like to give places a couple tries if I'm left uncertain. From my experience the food was \\\"OK\\\". Nothing to rave about, nothing memorable. The ambiance is cool and hip. It was kind of dead for a Las Vegas restaurant but then again it was a Monday night. I'd give it a 2nd shot if I didnt have to pay for dinner.",
        "Have come here a couple of times and it will be our go-to now.They have a fantastic happy hour, quality-wise and price-wise. The place is prettier on the inside than the outside and it's easy to miss. Has been pretty quiet when we've been in, around 4 pm on weekdays. Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!",
        "Fantastic food, service and surroundings and lived up to eggspectations \\nEggcellent value for money.",

        "They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",
        "Super friendly servers.  Fast service.  Had over easy eggs with sausage. Food was cooked well. And the sausage was home made and not out of a package..  Also tried the homemade hash which was also very good.   The reason for five star is the combo of super friendly people and homemade style breakfast.",
        "I've been there only once, and that was enough. Yes, it is too crowded and infested with undergrads. If you are in for a randomly meeting unattractive people, this may be the place for you.",
        "Never again! If you're trying to reschedule a hotel pick up, you're wasting your time and your money. Customer service sucks. You would do better to take the public bus system. Not only is it easier and more direct, it's a lot more inexpensive.",

        "OMG!  My boss took me here for lunch.  You order and pay for your order 1st.  The hamburgers were to die for.  The fries were very good and flavorful.  Fried twinkee is what we got for dessert.  I loved the whole meal and will bring family and friends back for sure.  I will take pictures next time so you can see how much you get for your money.  You will NOT be disapointed.",
        "Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \\\"locals\\\" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!",
        "WOW, times must be truly hard if they aren't able to fill a Cirque du Soleil stadium on a Saturday night in the prime section. We went last minute because the young man wanted to watch it again and boy I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it even the 2nd time round. We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around.",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4.",
        "I was hoping this would live up to my expectations, it did not. Stayed here in the summer of 2013, celebrating earning my stock broker license. The service from the get go at check in was terrible and only went down from there. The stay was terrible and it was very apparent that we didn't appear to have money, therefore we would be treated as such. Beautiful location and resort but the service was incredibly painful. I will not be returning.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",
        "This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome.",

        "Best Mexican Food in the valley!!!  Yummmmmmy!!!!!!  Super nice family!!!!",
        "Show is absolutely fantastic. Great show & great skits.. highly recommended. Only suggestion I would def. Give is to purchase the upgraded seats for the additional $25.. trust me you'll be glad you did... If your the type to get offended by swears and vulgarity this show might not be for you... def. Made for 18+.. Alot of funny sexual contents...",
        "Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!",
        "These animals are either going to die or depression or rebel and eat everyone.  I am surprised PETA has not visited this place and staged a mass protest.  Walking around is incredibly sad the animals either look like they are on thorzeine, or stare you down.  \\n\\nI do have to say, having lived in vegas for a few years, this place makes the must see list simply because it is such an epic fail.",
        "Disappointing. Color was not done well. Thus expensive for the results.   \\nGray was not covered. Friendly. Clean",
        "Incredibly overpriced!!  No valet parking available... Horrible service at the bar!  Requested feather free room and all pillows were feather.  Called the front desk three times and waited 90 minutes before they were replaced.  Unless you get a rate less than $140 it isn't worth it!!",
        "Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.  The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience.",
        "Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.",
        "Another great and honest service by Decatur Auto Electirc.  This is the 3rd time they have worked on my truck and have been resonable and honest each time.  Thank Luis and team for another job well done!  I will recomend you and be back with future issues I may encounter. Thanks, John",
        "This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!",
        "We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.  When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.  Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.  Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.",
        "This place is super sketchy! \\n\\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night.",
        "If you want great tasty boba, head next door to Super L Ranch Market.  If you want fresh daily baked breads, again, head next door to Super L.  All products are made fresh daily, no shipment come in weekdays.  All are freshly made for your enjoyment.",
        "If I could give this place 0 stars I would, that is how bad the food was. It seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn. I didn't think it was humanly possible, but I have finally found a buffet worse than Hometown Buffet. Good job Circus Circus.",
        "Yum!  Best fried catfish I have ever had.  The staff is super friendly the food is great.  The desert menu changes daily but if you have the chance to try the bread pudding, go for it!  The shrimp etouffe is a great buttery, garlic wonderland in your mouth.",
        "All of the dishes were fantastic, when the new owner took over. Now the dishes have been of such poor quality that I would rather eat \\\"Asian\\\" frozen food.",
        "Might be a tough pizza critic since we're from Chicago.  Dough was very thin and therefore 'wet' when ingredients were added.  It was okay but I wouldn't be anxious to have it again.  \\n\\nSalad with shredded chicken, feta, tomatoes, and pine nuts was fantastic.  Served super cold with a light vinegar and oil based dressing.",
        "I bought a Groupon for a one-hour massage. I had a choice between a therapeutic, acupressure, and Swedish. Since I don't like to be petted and am super ticklish, I went for a therapeutic one. Stephanie was amazing. She did a great job loosing up the knots I have in my shoulder area and she stretched me well too. I am very happy with the service I received. I would definitely recommend this place!",
        "Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!",
        "I go weekly for trivia.  The food's pretty good, but definitely a downgrade from the fantastic Fado that now only exists in spirit at Shakespeare's. The Irish nachos are a must. Fattening and decadent, no diets allowed here!\\n\\nThe staff is friendly. Great place, good food. They get pretty overwhelmed on Tuesdays because of trivia, so have patience.",
        "Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment.",
        "My favorite is your Gorgonzola bread & my husband loves the monterrey pepper jack with spicy tomato oil. I used DukesBread parsley oil to marinate chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill...they were fantastic!  I've also used it as a sauce over salmon.  You have consistently great products - many thanks! We will see you every Sat!",
        "If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \\\"chips\\\", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!\\n\\nHighly recommended for pizza!,",
        "Probably one of the coolest bars in Madison. Quirky without being pretentious, laid back without being soporific. Fantastic beer selection and really friendly staff.",
        "Why is this place so fantastic?\\nI don't even know. What a great addition to the scene.\\n\\nI am from Pittsburgh but now live in NYC and the bagel I had here this morning could rival a NYC bagel.\\n\\nSupport your local businesses, folks. This place is TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!",
        "Horribly slow here with food, and some items were just downright foul (eggs in the breakfast burrito).  Hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though, as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce.  No real drive-thru.  What the heck?",
        "I loved the ice coffee and everything I've ordered here has been fantastic!\\nIs my go to breakfast joint while in this area."

        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "Very bomb sandwich place choose this place over Jimmy John's and Subway. The milkshakes are great you can combine two flavors of your choosing and they're very tasty! I also love how they can toaster subs through toaster to make them toasty!",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.",
        "This is located conveniently next to the hard rock hotel. When they say everything is bigger in Vegas, they aren't kidding. This cvs was huge and had everything you could possibly need. The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \\nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open.",
        "I do not like it here. PERIOD.\\n\\nJust kidding. Not just that.. I don't like the crowd here..\\n\\nYeah yeah yeah.. its all the same; chyeah right! It's not. People here are a lot older downstairs. Upstairs, you get really weird looking people.\\n\\nI hate that bubble machine that throw's recycled old water bubble foam at you.. no no no!",
        "First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.",
        "The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).",
        "Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.",
        "Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",
        "Sorry to say that Rey and Becky (owners) have let down there regulars on a regular basis.  We've had problems the last three times and they've either got it wrong or took way too long.  Tonight was no different.  They catered to a large party and told us they purposely out to go orders behind them...I've been a regular since they've opened.  For better service go to Tomo...WAY BETTER SERVICE!!!!",

I was thisclose to stealing one of those cute blue pillows they have, but thought better of it. \\nWasted $110 on gambling in about 2 and a half seconds and then decided to spend my money shopping and eating instead. Room service makes a bomb omlette.",
        "I'm not sure what your expecting for $16.99. I didn't mind it. I was on a diet when I ate here. It was doable but I did end up using all my calories at breakfast. Crazy, right? It was just average. It wasn't horrible. I've had horrible. It's just on the lower end for Las Vegas...or as the locals call it Vegas..or maybe they just say LV!",
        "The food was ok but tricky advertising.\\nThe sign out side says in small letters salmon and then %50 off sushi in big letters.  You think everything is %50 off it's only order of salmon sushi.  Vary tricky advertising.  So we won't go back!",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",

        "We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks. It was great as far as I could tell, and it wasn't busy.. but neither was anything else at the time. The flavors were awesome, everything was fresh and tasty.. I say give it a try. I will be back Lemongrass!",

        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",

        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",

It pains me to say this place has really gone downhill from what it once was. I haven't been back in a long time.",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",

        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.",
        "I have to say some items are overpriced. The bubble tea is nice. The food is ok for me.",
        "We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!",
        "This place is amazing!  The bacon mashed potato omelet is a must.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.",
        "Really liked this place.  It had a nice layout of the casino floor, it was not smokey, and it had a very open feel to it.  Well kept up.  Stop by and say hi.",

        "It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \\\"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\\\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.",
        "This place was amazing! I was very impressed, considering it was my first time, all my expectations were met. Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",

As stated in the other reviews, I haven't been able to get an apt., or talk to a real live person, only told to send an e-mail.  The address is still listed incorrectly.  I would say there is \\\"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE\\\"  at all.  How do you run a business  like this and expect return customs",

One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\\n\\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",

Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "Meh. Is about the perfect way to describe this place. First, it's too expensive (I know it's Vegas, on the Strip, but improve quality if you're going to have such high cost). Food was okay at best. With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one.",
        "OKAY so im not a big fan of this place,but everything else is soo far from me. I will say though I do enjoy the carne asada fries hold the pico. I also love grabbing some cucumbers and radishes mix in some lime and salt and BAM awesome snack!",
        "The only reason I'm leaving a star is because I absolutely have to.   The nicest way to put this is that the best part of my experience was exiting the building. Attentiveness to refills was poor. Appetizers as well as main meal and sides  were like warm and the fish was barely cooked and rubbery.   Broccoli was barely cooked needless to say I will never EVER be back.",

Decided to take my daughter to check it out we got there at 9:29 pm and it looked like they were closing,  the open sign was shut off and the screens were down. Even though yelp says they close at 10. Bad first impression will stick with Froyona.",

        "We stopped here on the way to the airport and it was pretty lame!  It was HH without a bartender - WTF? Our server was slow as a snail and got yelled at by the manager.  Also, he forgot our drinks.  And our sushi sat at the bar foreeevvverrrr before he picked it up.\\n\\nOur rolls had too much sauce on it and weren't cut all the way through.  UGH.",
        "This place is awesome! The staff greets you right away & seem real genuine!

        "Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \\n\\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\\n\\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.",

We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around.",
        "We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a clean neat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at $5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip.",
        "Talk about an interesting location. This restaurant is in the parking garage for the city of Las Vegas. The service was really good the menu is kind of plain.  They have a few breakfast items and a few lunch items.  I had an omelette and it wasn't anything great but it wasn't bad.  It was slightly pricey for what you got.  I wouldn't say no to this place but I don't think you want to go here a lot.",
        "We had so much fun! My son ordered the best Red Velvet pancakes ever with cream cheese syrup, whipped cream and chocolate shavings! I loved my cheese and green chile omelette with side of Banana Cream Pie pancakes. The service was friendly and atmosphere casual and cool! Definitely worth driving over from the strip and a favorite new stop on our next trip to Vegas!",

I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",
        "As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.",
        "Last night, while thinking about this place, I actually started to drool. I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.\\n\\nGo on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Wow is a good way to start with. I was blown away with this show. Words are hard to put together to show how much i loved it! A Beatles Tribute it is, the music had everyone moving to the beat. It was AWESOME for me and the Wife to see. It was the best show we have ever seen. And the best of Cirque du Soleil, I'd have to say.",
        "Can't beat their selection on children's clothing. I was commenting to an employee about the great finds for children's clothes and toys and she mentioned that's most of their donations. When I'm in town I'll make it a point to go there again.",

It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "These animals are either going to die or depression or rebel and eat everyone.  I am surprised PETA has not visited this place and staged a mass protest.

I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",

My friend and I arrived 10 minutes after Happy Hour ended and decide to forget that idea and go somewhere else.\\n\\nWhat I can say for the place even during non-Happy Hour times is that they have delicious (and STRONG) drinks. Also, the food is adequate. Certainly not terrible, but not enough to pay more than 10 bucks for a roll. Nope. Sorry.",

When we went back to say we had asked for gin and tonics, she insisted we'd said soda and refused to change them. Seriously, who t f orders gin and sodas? That on top of another rude (though shirtless and pretty) waiter. Never again!",
        "Veggie omelette was way over cooked,  hard and dry ... Not good at all ... Very disappointing since I had had better food there a couple of years ago. My companion experienced the same with her omelette. So my advice ... At the very least ... Don't order an omelette ... Especially given the price.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",
        "I really enjoyed my choice of black coffee here while my friends didn't. I just think they chose the wrong one. I got the one that was mixed with dark and light roast beans. I can't remember the name but it was delicious! No disgusting coffee aftertaste. All in all, I'd be back here and get the same coffee the next time I'm in town!",

They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",

        "Overpriced and horrible.  Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really?? That for $11 + tip??",

Brave the crowds and the sidewalk debauchery, come see this.  Bathrooms are clean.  The facility alone is worth the trip, details on the interior of the building is beautiful.  The flowers, layouts, decor and scents are a sensory feast.  Great shopping too.",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",

While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",
        "This was the 2nd place we went to try and sell old gold pieces we no longer wear. What a difference in knowledge and costumer service we received going here. The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \\nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.",

Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",
        "Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",

Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls.",

The real only flaw is the somewhat vague storyline but who cares about storylines when u r watching incredibly creative set and costume and choreography. \\nAfter a few beers I realized that the KA storyline is basically star wars.  If you keep that in mind it all makes sense- Luke and princess leah versus Darth vader and the emporor. Easy as that",

If you want a different atmosphere, give it a try, you wont be disappointed. \\n\\nOnly down side is that It is a snowbird mecca",

The Fresh basil on top was a nice touch  The mariana sauce was cold when they put it on top of the crepe so it ruined the entire dish. :( This also made the cheese clump together faster, making it more dissatisfying by the bite. It had so much potential!!! I'm disappointed.",

Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",

Of particular note is the fact they have a good selection of plastic models such as cars, airplanes, ships, etc and all the needed supplies to assemble them including glues, cements, and paints.\\n\\nThe prices on the models range from $10 to $30 and seem to be quite a bit cheaper than Hobby Lobby and Hobby Bench which are competing stores in the area.",
        "This outlet location is okay. I liked that they had mens, womens, and kids clothes. I went during winter and they had a good amount of sweaters and jackets. The prices were reasonable but the store was pretty disorganized. Not a bad place to shop if you already know what you're looking for.",
        "If this is for Caesar's Palace, GREAT SELECTION. I don't really browse the bags (because everyone thinks they're so boss with them, they're overrated, I go for the luggage) but the bikinis and dresses they had in MY size! Can you believe that? It's bigger than Gucci, but then again, most people want an LV than a GG, especially tourists. I always return.",
        "In here to pick up a replacement straightening doo-dad for Mrs K., we found a huge variety with prices ranging from $10 to beyond $250. We managed to avoid getting asked if we needed any help and managed to avoid buying anything else. How does that happen?\\n\\nLots of stuff if you're looking for gifts, too!",

        "Fun trip, convenient pick up and drop off, LOTS of information from our tour guide/driver Larry. Such a fun day. We experienced rain and snow along the way, beautiful Sedona, and stopped at the reservation on the way back.  Definitely book your GC trip with Detours!!",
        "Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!",
        "Horrible worst service I've ever had. Slow no check backs no refills asked for one it never came. Poured water with glasses on the table splashing ever where. Watched an employee use the bathroom and then not wash hands. Food was great but can't say I'll be back.",
        "I heard about Bob the bartender for a few weeks. This past weekend, I had the pleasure of meeting him. Not only is he a super-friendly, fun, chill guy... but a phenomenal mixologist!!  He made us several unique concoctions, from floral foam topped drinks to cucumber martini's. \\n\\nI would follow Bob to any bar... he is a gift for Charlotte.",
        "This place by far had the most heavenly crepes I have ever eaten and they make it right in front of you! I love the chocolate fountain they displayed and this little gem was by far the best at our stay at the Bellagio. 2nd best is their breakfast buffet lol\\n\\nI also had coconut macaroons and madelines as gifts and the receivers said they were great as well!",
        "Very soggy pizza, my sub same very soggy. They need to cook their bread products more. Boneless wings taste like the came from a TV dinner and out of a microwave. Service was slow, drinks were empty before an offer for refill.\\n\\nNot coming back.",

        "Cupcakes and frosting shots, oh my!  This place is always busy and I think its the cupcakes.  My absolute favs are the Cinnamon and Red Velvet cupcakes!  I can't wait for the Pumpkin cupcakes that come out in the fall.",
        "The server was really sweet and helpful. My crepe was ok though. I ordered the Japan crepe and it was pretty salty. I think it was from the miso sauce that was on it. But girl and chef overheard me talking to my friend and offered to make it less salty next time I stop by, which was really sweet in my opinion. \\n\\nOverall good service and kind staff, but food was average.",
        "For the money its not worth it.  I have had better meals at King's Fish House.  The arrogance in the air was hard to stomach and I was not impressed with the food.\\n\\nNothing was bad, but for 300 plus dollars I would expect to feel like it was all incredible.\\n\\nUnless someone else is picking up the tab on this one, I'm in no hurry to venture back.",
        "Perfect shop for unique, witty, and humorous cards, gorgeous stationery, beautiful paper goods, and various novelties and gifts. I appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous. Parking can be a pain, but once you score a spot, you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store.",
        "Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth.",
        "The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.\\n\\nWhen returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.\\n\\nUnprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.",
        "Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!"

        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",
        "Waiting for the connection flight, I decided to get a beer. I found the Home Turf Bar, which was right next to my gate.\\n\\nI wasn't hungry and just wanted a quick beer before my flight. They had Shocktop, which is okay with me. It was an okay place to pass the time before it was time to move on.",
        "Great service! No wait, actually owned by Pamela's! The food was great-- maybe even better than next door! All sorts of Yiddish references and fun Jewish foods that are hard to find elsewhere. Love the challah French toast. Highly recommended!!",
        "Food is great, if you like waiting for 45 minutes for it. There were three of us and its not like we ordered anything complicated either. The server did aplolgize several times and offered us free dessert, which was also a waiting game as well. I love the food there but thats about where it ends.",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "Love this place - a must stop every time I am in the greater PHX area on business.\\nSean and Elena in the bar are the best!!! Food is great, atmosphere even better after work and for games. Try the Scotch Eggs - a real treat.",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy....",
        "Great place to go on a Monday afternoon. There were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot. I was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best, but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff.",
        "I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went on a Saturday night so it was bustling with young people. They have every fun bar game you could imagine: pool, darts, shuffle board, air hockey, karaoke, and more. They also have Shocktop on tap which is a win-win for me. Get a couple drinks in you and you are bound to have a blast here. I know I did.",
        "I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "A coffee joint down the street recommended  this place. And since I love the coffee joint, I thought that this must be good. WRONG! We were right by the door, cashiers area & had the worst service! The food was blah!! I will NOT return.",
        "Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also. \\nSake bomb, anyone? :-)",
        "Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",

        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "Under staffed and under trained staff. Not your typical Oreganos experience. Staff is rough. \\nA chaotic dining experience at best. An espoused Chicago restaurant and no Blackhawks game only Ozzie and Harriet come on now.....Cave Creek is starving for any dining experience ...Time will tell....",
        "Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.",
        "Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",
        "We loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff.  Get the free headsets to learn more details.  It had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art.  We saw some new (just new to us) techniques and mediums like casein paint, egg tempera, etc. Very nice little gift shop.",

        "Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.",
        "Specialising in mussels, oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we weren't disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains. Yummy. Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken. However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didn't have to wait too long.",
        "Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!",

The food is excellent and I found the service to be awesome.  They were very attentive, never needed to ask for anything as they were at the table checking in very often.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",

        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.",
        "This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those.",

        "We got there late at 9 am.  Such A LONG line, but there were tons of tables so I don't understand.  Waited thirty minutes and left.  It was 11/11/13 .  I'll use open table next time.",
        "My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise. Our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing. The service was alright but the place seemed dirty. Even though this place is conveniently located near my house, I'm not returning.",
        "Seriously?!?  You really don't want me to spend my money here... Ok...  the most od aweful service I have ever received in a retail store in my life.   They literally turned a few hundred dollars worth of sales I was about to make out the door.  I will NEVER go back here again.",
        "Update: went back today for my beloved Passion Tea Lemonade... it took 17 minutes from stepping in line until I finally got my drink. And to make it worse, my tea was luke warm at the bottom if the cup and only cold at top where the ice is.. how did they manage to pull that one off? Not shaking it properly? Who knows..",
        "It is little pricy but they give you o much meat that it makes up for it.  I have only has the gyros.  The have good food, beer, and wifi great place to go for lunch in between classes at GCC.",
        "Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.",
        "Located in a very run-down strip mall, if you're going to go you have to be prepared for the hole-in-the-wall place that this is. When I was there, there was only one employee in the place (Noon on a Thursday). And they had no customers. The guy was nice, took my order and cooked it up. Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",
        "Waited for ever for the host to appear. Never did. I had to walk into the restaurant and find myself a table. They need an complete overhaul of their staff. \\n\\nFood was standard thai. It was ok, nothing great though.",
        "Sensational! \\n\\nBruntsfield does it again! La Barantine serves up absolutely sensational sandwiches and their pastries, sublime. I had a pistachio macaroon and was blown away by its taste!\\n\\nOnly very small inside so if walking past and you see a free table inside, grab it!!!!",
        "Great location with easy access to monorail, express bus, and bridges to cross busy streets. Good staff and lobby experience. Hotel rooms are very large but the reason for three stars: out-dated tube tvs that have poor reception on half the channels, and a bathtub-shower door combination that is ancient. But I loved the value and the access to Paris Las Vegas and its delectable restaurants. Nice pool.",
        "I would highly recommend this place over any Denny's or IHOP. The food is much better in quality, while being comparable in price range to other diners.\\n\\nWe were seated very quickly, and the waitresses were tentative and kind.\\n\\nGreat for large parties, and for anyone who needs some standard, fill-you-up breakfast or brunch!",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",

Our training class has helped Jagger and I so much! Thank you Leah!",

        "Very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money... I did however purchase the 3 for $57 so we chose this the Secret Garden at mirage and Bodies the exhibition at Luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3!",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "Used to have to come here to pick up coffee for my lazy boss but after switching jobs realized I was right next door and have now been coming every day for nearly a year. \\n\\nWard and Monica are great. They will let you try stuff, explain coffee stuff, and recommend stuff. \\n\\nEveryone loves the kale but the stalker and squashed mango are my favorites.",
        "The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.",

        "I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\\n\\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!",
        "Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \\\"happy hour\\\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!",
        "The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\\n\\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \\n\\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations.",
        "Fun casino with lots to do for the whole family. The arcade is one of the largest I've seen on the strip with tons of affordable games and tournament of kings is an awesome show",
        "We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a clean neat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at $5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip.",
        "Do they get shut down every other month for serving alcohol to minors? It feels like it.\\n\\nAte at the restaurant ONCE in my lifetime but been to the karaoke rooms a ton! FUN, FUN, FUN! With your private karaoke room, you can also order food and drinks. Just hit that black button at the door.\\n\\nService, eh. Price, cheap enough. GREAT for groups.",
        "Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4.",
        "Meh, I was not impressed overall. It was just too crowded to play the games, people kept bumping into each other.",
        "This is a great location on the strip - just a short walk to about any property you want. And the room rates are dirt cheap - $40 on the strip? OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "This review is for the Mad Greek Primm, NV \\\"stateline\\\"\\nFood is ok, not great or craving to come back. Every table had a bottle of tapatio on it, this should be a clear message they are not serious about Greek food.",
        "We heard great things about this place and decided to give it a shot for breakfast and we were sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre and was served lukewarm. The service was slow and inconsistent. We had to request our check from the host stand since the waitress never returned, the owner was visiting most of the tables, but never stopped by ours, and the price was expensive for what we got. The only upside was the french toast special we split was yummy.",
        "decent place. tvs, outside seating, and a roll of paper towels hanging on every table! i'm definitely a fan of pizza and beer, only you have to drink the beer there (draft- pretty good!), so take out doesn't afford that combination.  they have wine too.  their appetizers seem good, but i just had the pizza (with veggie toppings) which was just ok.  nothing too special here... maybe its location.",
        "This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "What's your time worth?  Dollar doesn't think its worth much.  It's 11:30pm, over 40 families are editing in line ... With three (3) agents to serve.  It's a gross display of ignorance & arrogance!  I can't ever imagine renting from Dollar EVER!  You shouldn't either.  Lesson learned.",
        "I was pretty disappointed with Whisky River - we were expecting an awesome bar with tons of whisky mixed drinks... they only had a small selection of whisky.  It was more like flavored vodka river - We didn't stay to eat after waiting at the bar for our table and finding out that it was more commercialized then specialized.  I'm sure some people will really like this place, but its just like your average Chilies restaurant.",
        "Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction",
        "This is a beautiful place to see the seasonal themes change.  It's a living breathing art exhibit.  I absolutely love walking around the conservatory and seeing all the incredible colors used in nature for humanities viewing pleasure. \\nI try to go at least four times a year. \\n\\nAfter you see the gardens walk outside and watch the fountains for an even better experience.",
        "So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families.",
        "The sales approach at this place is nothing short of a Used Car lot.  Three gentlemen fought over shaking my hand as I walked through the door and everything went downhill from there.",
        "This place sells... Yup, you guessed it! Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on.",
        "These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.",
        "I highly recommend  this Bistro on amherst montreal, Its brand new the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I love  the ambiance and the owner is awesome.  They told me they will have a terrace for this summer :)  the great thing is they  change the table d'h\\u00f4te several times during the week so you don't get bored of the same menu. Finally great food with a great price .",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.  When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.  Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.  Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.",
        "I had an excellent experience with this company. They came out for a no pressure estimate and explained all of my options and the pricing. Then they were patient while I decided and even had them re-quote different styles for me. They under-promised and over-delivered, which is great. They estimated three weeks and my gate was installed in one.",
        "If you want great tasty boba, head next door to Super L Ranch Market.  If you want fresh daily baked breads, again, head next door to Super L.  All products are made fresh daily, no shipment come in weekdays.  All are freshly made for your enjoyment.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "Pretty cool Sports Bar full of sports paraphernalia and several TV.s that play several sports at the same time which is cool when you want to watch more than one game at a time. \\nService was decent, coffee fresh but strong(had to double creamed it) and drink I ordered mix well.\\n\\nAll in all if there was a game I'd want to watch and hang with friends, I'd definitely consider going to Champs",
        "We came into Las Vegas from Phoenix and found this gem of a store. They were very well stocked with games for anyone's taste and the staff was extremely knowledgeable about their stock and the game industry.",
        "If you are looking for a clean place this is probably not the place.  Something has to be said about the cooling system (aka the huge floor fan in the back).  The tables are sticky and the bathroom door is black and it is not the paint.  However the food is great and mostly (emphasis on mostly) fresh.  Don't come here if you are looking for a pleasant atmosphere and it is probably better to get your food to go!",
        "If the main casino isn't quiet enough for you (though that's unlikey!), head upstairs to this sports bar. There is gaming at the bar and a nice selection of draft beer. There are also tables for easy viewing of the many TVs. You must try the $1 cheese pizza slices, which are only available when the kitchen is open (weekends only unless during game season I think). The pizza is great!"

        "It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.",
        "Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again.",
        "This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it - share, the portion is HUUUUGEE.\\n\\nThis place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",
        "Grass fed burger! And four types of bloody Mary's!",
        "Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint , clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. \\n\\nOh well, onto the next burger joint.",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",

How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.",

In spite of these challenges I will continue to take my family to see Dr. Carpenter. the office staff is friendly and helpful. The facility is very nice and always clean. Dr. Carpenter has a kind demeanor and is unfailingly patient. If quality of care is your top priority this is the doctor for you.",
        "saw the show tonight and it was ok ..dont expect anything spectacular but it is worth the 10.00 you pay at gold star for it.  all the seats are pretty good but kind of a run down theatre but manageable. Jokes arent all that funny but hey they are trying and the show is a pretty low budget show.. But for the money it will most likely entertain you.",

        "CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.  This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain.\\n\\nThe savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.  I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.  Awesome store!!!",

        "Saw a boxing match here.  No complaints.  The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",
        "Had lunch here with some people from work and as always its great.  The service was a little slow, but what isnt in Vegas.  \\nI had the Grilled Shrimp Salad with a extra shrimp.  It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone..",

Got one cheese slice and it was just great.\\n\\nI haven't had an authentic new york style pizza, so I couldn't compare, but for pizza it was really good.\\n\\nThis place is small and if busy might be hard to find a spot to sit and eat, but pizza is pretty easy to just eat on the go.",

Great drink for the hot AZ summer!  Tinga tacos are my absolutely favorite.  Great crunchy chicken taco!  Great place in OT for some awesome food and drinks.  This is one of the best happy hour locations in town!",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",

They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",

        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.",

Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way.",
        "The decor and vibe are way classier than the Peoria location, however the service is a bit lacking. It's large, clean, and has indoor and outdoor seating, but it definitely is suited for the Old Town Scottsdale crowd. Their menu is pricier and more upscale than the Peoria location, as well.",
        "Love their massages !! It's not a big place, but the service is great and their massotherapists are very good at what they are doing... I have been there a couple times now, they treated my shoulder and neck pain and now no more headaches :) definitely worth it!",
        "This place is definitely not your run-of-the-mill movie theater, nestled in a night club.... but what the hell? Why not?\\n\\nClean, comfortable, fun, and great movie selections.  Definitely more expensive than the average theater... but the seats are twice the size and you can pick your seats in advance.  You also have the option for more than just mediocre movie food + full bar.",

        "Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar.\\n\\n\\n You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "if Arizona calls this one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I must say they are out of their mind. This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Staff seems to be very arrogant. Simply put, If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the last place I would go to.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",

Yummy!",
        "Definitely worth the watch. We found that they had the understudy performing parts and she often sounded better. Though mostly just a personal preference for voices.",

Brave the crowds and the sidewalk debauchery, come see this.  Bathrooms are clean.  The facility alone is worth the trip, details on the interior of the building is beautiful.  The flowers, layouts, decor and scents are a sensory feast.  Great shopping too.",
        "Awesome bulgogi tacos! Chef didn't have Kim chi so he whipped up some Asian slaw for my friend. I had the New Mexico burger w/garlic fries, which were delicious!

Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.",

        "This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those.",
        "They always put a lot of effort into this exhibit, and considering it's a free attraction that says a lot about Bellagio! On the weekend it can get quite crowded - it's a small area - but definitely worth seeing if you are in the area!",
        "Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.\\nMy Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.\\nFriendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.\\nExtra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!",
        "This could be the best restaurant in Charlotte. I have been three times now and each experience is unbelievable. The pasta dishes are all perfect and each should be ordered to share. The falafel is some of the best I have ever had. The steam bun is such a pleasant surprise. Each dish is so well thought out and the service is always great. Though I can't eat shellfish I've always been told that the scallops are to die for.",
        "Fair prices [including kids size] and great specialty flavors! Saw them @ First Friday and it was definitely a great stop on a hot June day. Quick and friendly service with a smile! They drive their truck to many locations so call and see where they are located and go get one of their shaved ice treats!",
        "i freaking love this place! my phone broke, and they fixed it like nothing happened! i will definitely go to them when there is a problem with my phone again. thank you!",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "This was the 2nd place we went to try and sell old gold pieces we no longer wear. What a difference in knowledge and costumer service we received going here. The Owner was so friendly and even took time teaching us what to look for in diamonds, resale value, etc. the amount he have us for our jewelry was very fair and roughly 30% -50% more then other places offered. Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "My mom gets a bigger kick out of this place than I do. It seemed to specialize in upholstery, and the walls are lined with swatches. I did like that the woman allowed me to take mini-swatches off of the wall, but I didn't wind up finding any fabrics that worked for my projects. I'll definitely try back here.",
        "One of the best pho noodle places there is.  I definitely recommend anyone go there if you love noodle soup.",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes.",
        "This place was amazing! I was very impressed, considering it was my first time, all my expectations were met. Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",
        "I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!",
        "I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.\\nWe didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. \\nBut I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs.",
        "eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale.",
        "I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now.",
        "Wow this place is awesome!!! Cool people and there's a hot lady that works in there. Yup. Go do some business at Hilands Cigars if you like good deals, and chilling!",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "8 of us just finished eating here.  Service was very friendly, prices were definitely reasonable, and we all really enjoyed our meals. \\n\\nI would come back again for sure!\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn't snap any photos of our food, but here are a few of the place.",
        "This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again.",
        "The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \\\"gross\\\" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around.",
        "The food is absolutely spectacular. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. The only reason I leave off one star is because some of the waitresses aren't spectacular. I also get very annoyed with picking up food. The hostess will tell me 15 minutes and it will take longer than 30. I even leave late expecting the long wait and will still have to sit around for a few minutes for it. Every once in a while they forget the miso soup too.",
        "Very good authentic Chinese food.  Located upstair in Chinatown alley.",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",

        "I am very happy Madison finally has an antique oddities shop. I was pleasantly surprised by finding true medical antiquities and and just strange fun decor. The prices are quite reasonable and the store is displayed well. I will definitely be going back.",
        "Went here over the holidays w/my parents, sister, and parents' friends.  This place is definitely a dive.  Good, relaxed atmosphere.  They had a Hawaiian breeze drink special that night--those were good and reasonably priced.  I had wings for dinner--they were mediocre.  Not too spicy.  I am kinda picky about my wings.",
        "This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place.",
        "We eat here almost every month, excellent veal and pasta dishes, pizza and likes the seafood salad.",
        "My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \\n\\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.",
        "Very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money... I did however purchase the 3 for $57 so we chose this the Secret Garden at mirage and Bodies the exhibition at Luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3!",
        "I definitely get more out of a massage, but for what it is-it's a neat service to have as a walk-in. My back refused to crack because my muscles were so tight, so I didn't feel like I got much out of it. :( my neck popped pretty decent though and I got a good stretching. The doctor was really nice. Next time I will just go get a massage instead..."

        "I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",
        "After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives i thought I would try it out.  The Pig Dip is the signature dish and it was everything I thought it would be.  Edgy atmosphere and complimentary valet parking made it convenient. \\n\\nService was average and the valet driver was not afraid to hit the gas and squeal the tires on my Tundra.\\n\\nGo for the food, you won't be disappointed.",
        "I've been a long time customer of Oregano's, so I was excited to see a new one open up near my house.  I'm happy to say the food is just as fabulous and my server Jordan was fantastic. Very funny and on top of her game!  If you're into a good sandwich then I'd recommend the Stuffed Turkey. The full size was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.",
        "I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.",
        "Love this place - a must stop every time I am in the greater PHX area on business.\\nSean and Elena in the bar are the best!!! Food is great, atmosphere even better after work and for games. Try the Scotch Eggs - a real treat.",
        "On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there..",
        "I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.",
        "Not too bad Khmer/Chinese/Thai/Viet food here. Good fish, shrimp and seafood dishes here. I believe this is part of the California chain. The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision.",
        "I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "worst food, got sick on the gross egg dish, there was also hair in the food.  Too noisy and cold, will not go here again.  Had guests and they were disappointed also.",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",
        "Dimly lit restaurant and lounge. Couches. Candles. Hot hot sex. \\n\\nDopest tapas place in Vegas and a well known local spot. Sangrias and Mojitos, fill em up. Have a yourself a good time. Hanging with friends or your lover, you're sure to have an intimate night.\\n\\nSkip the strip, come to Firefly. You'll thank me later.",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \\\"Yum\\\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.",
        "We loved this beautiful museum with friendly staff.  Get the free headsets to learn more details.  It had a great balance of local history with more contemporary art.  We saw some new (just new to us) techniques and mediums like casein paint, egg tempera, etc. Very nice little gift shop.",
        "Their desserts are very light. It's not super sweet so if you're looking for a sugar overload this is not the place. The strawberry Milli crepe cake is delicious! The strawberry whip cream crepe is fantastic as well. I'd highly recommend both. I'm looking forward to trying more desserts in the future.",
        "Pulled pork was tough, dry, and vinegary.  Fries were old and soggy.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "This place has mediocre drinks & food. I've tried a few food items, boba, & fruit shaved ice. Not sure if the drinks are fresh because I always leave with that syrup-like taste. The last visit I had, the place unfortunately stunk. Thanks for good service & being open late though!",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special.",
        "Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE.",
        "New Mexico Chile soup, salad and beer bread - yum! German sausage plate - yes! Chocolate paired with beer ( you can't leave without tasting the tri -pepper pairing), what's not to like? Pub food does not have to be greasy frat food. Thank you, Great Dane, for a fabulous lunch!",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",
        "Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.",
        "Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.",
        "Absolutely delicious! Very friendly service as well.\\n\\nGot 2 broths, Thai and Chinese, with 2 meats (shabu beef and pork loin), 2 vegetables (shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage), 1 house special firm tofu, and oval noodles.",
        "Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. \\n\\nThe Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). \\n\\nThe salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!",
        "This is my favorite Las Vegas attraction.  Amazing!  We saw it at night and had to come back to see it during daylight.  Both spectacular.  I highly recommend this.  Free is a great value.  Brave the crowds and the sidewalk debauchery, come see this.  Bathrooms are clean.  The facility alone is worth the trip, details on the interior of the building is beautiful.  The flowers, layouts, decor and scents are a sensory feast.  Great shopping too.",
        "Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",
        "The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.",
        "If you're a barbecue fan, this is the place for you.  Get the little pig if you're a beginner, its a good intro to BBQ.  The atmosphere is great, and on a sunny day there is no better place to grab a beer (specially on work lunch break - wink wink).  Parking can be a challenge at time but nothing too concerining.",
        "friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.",
        "Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",
        "Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food.",
        "this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.",
        "Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables.",
        "My favorite burger. Very good. Thick and juicy. Yum.! Also big selections of meats and toppings and even bread",
        "Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,",
        "The variety is great, but I think they if they served the princess cupcake every day they would get so much more business! Cupcakes are top heavy which is fine because the icing taste way better than the cake itself. I found the cake portion of the cupcake to be mediocre but the icing is totally worth it! The best flavors are Miss Princess, Wedding Cake, & Birthday cake. I do feel the prices are too high.",
        "Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",
        "Great location, great environment, and great food. Oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended.",
        "Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \\nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \\nPerfect spot for a romantic night.",
        "Fantastic food, service and surroundings and lived up to eggspectations \\nEggcellent value for money.",
        "Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",
        "Pizza is okay NOT THE BEST ..very rude ppl asked for a slice ..they didnt have a slice i had to buy a whole pizza..should consider taking the slices of the menu it happend one time now a second time!! Will never go bak here again!!",
        "Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad.",
        "This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place.",
        "This is a very high end mall and not somewhere that I would buy anything. There are tons of fashion/clothes shops, so perhaps it's good if you like that sort of shopping. There is also an Apple store, which is cool. I visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded. For the number of large and fancy malls in the Phoenix area, this one doesn't measure up for me.",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy.",
        "My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",
        "Just had some of their tres leches cake last night...very good!",
        "Super friendly servers.  Fast service.  Had over easy eggs with sausage. Food was cooked well. And the sausage was home made and not out of a package..  Also tried the homemade hash which was also very good.   The reason for five star is the combo of super friendly people and homemade style breakfast.",
        "We gave this place a try for breakfast and dinner, and were disappointed both times. The breakfast experience was terrible- extremely slow service, ran out of coffee, food came out wrong, took 10 minutes to get hot sauce while over cooked eggs got cold. Food was way over priced, especially for dinner.",
        "My friend is Siclian and for years I could only eat italian food when I went to his place cause of how good and authentic. Right down to the homemade vodka sauce.  The egg plant parm here is amazing.  With the proper distribution of cheese through out the whole meal.  This is my new spot, best italian in Vegas off the strip guarantee!!",
        "good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.",
        "This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour.",
        "Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.",
        "The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \\n\\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.",
        "Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \\\"locals\\\" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!",
        "I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.",
        "Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \\n\\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\\n\\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.",
        "Nolia serves upscale Southern cuisine, and my dinner there was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The pork was tender and the sweet potatoes were perfect. Nolia, in an historic house in Elizabeth, reminded me of Charleston, SC. The fancy, but friendly atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. That location has seen many restaurants. I hope Nolia lasts.",
        "I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too.",
        "We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!",
        "Stopped in for lunch had the maza plate,stuffed eggplant and beef kabob everything was very fresh and delicious We will definitely  be back",
        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "Last night, while thinking about this place, I actually started to drool. I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.\\n\\nGo on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Seriously this place is amazing! This is exactly how food should be made. The nachos with pork and prickly pear sauce are incredible.",
        "love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.",
        "it rocked!!! Their version of a BLT was out if this world from the bread to the avacado oh my. a might messy to EAT but well worth the post eats hand scrubbing",
        "The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!",
        "Pretty big menu, and overall pretty decent breakfast...nothing crazy good here though, everything I have had is just ok. Egg works got them beat for sure! Or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup!",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "So, I went here because it had four and a half stars on Yelp. Would have never found this place on my own as it is tucked on a side street along the runway of the Scottsdale airport.  The food did not disappoint.  The bread was average, but the dipping sauce made up for it.  The only reason it did not get five stars is that it's wine selection is pretty limited.  Service was great, perfect for families.",
        "Renegade always has consistently great food. It's also very nice inside with an open atmosphere and classy decor. I love everything on their menu, and I usually get their salmon. And... best of all.... the BREAD PUDDING. So nom. My parents really like the creme brulee too. Great spot with great food!",
        "Yet again I had to go to this place and yet again I come up with the same question\\n\\\" WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SERVING WATER IN THOSE SMUDGY BOTTLES??\\\"\\nand YES! yet again i saw some floaters in my water....i would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread",
        "Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.  The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience.",
        "The egg pizza is the bomb!!  Also, awesome garlic fries and a great chopped salad.  Everyone we recommended the egg pizza to loved it!!",
        "This so bad! My husband and I walked in ordered a beer, hot tea and nachos without beans. 20 minutes later we get the nachos with beans so my husband asked if we could get them without from a different server because our server went on break. The manager came over and was so rude and blamed everyone else for the mistake. Because of the management I would never go back. He yelled at the bartender for trying to help us with our order!"

        "I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's.",
        "Very bomb sandwich place choose this place over Jimmy John's and Subway. The milkshakes are great you can combine two flavors of your choosing and they're very tasty! I also love how they can toaster subs through toaster to make them toasty!",
        "I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",
        "I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.",
        "Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location",
        "My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.",
        "A bit hard to find, but well worth the hunt.  It is on the thrid floor of the cosmopolitan.  Got one cheese slice and it was just great.\\n\\nI haven't had an authentic new york style pizza, so I couldn't compare, but for pizza it was really good.\\n\\nThis place is small and if busy might be hard to find a spot to sit and eat, but pizza is pretty easy to just eat on the go.",
        "Holy Tequila!  Luv the margaritas here!  House margaritas are the best.  I highly recommend the Cucumber margarita!  Its cool and refreshing with the perfect amount of tequila.  Great drink for the hot AZ summer!  Tinga tacos are my absolutely favorite.  Great crunchy chicken taco!  Great place in OT for some awesome food and drinks.  This is one of the best happy hour locations in town!",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.",
        "Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!",
        "Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the \\\"Sun City rush\\\" is insane.  The ribs were amazing...",
        "I may not be back like previously stated.\\n\\nThe last two times I got take out food, the chips tasted like they had been cooked in rancid oil and the salsa was waaay too salty. It pains me to say this place has really gone downhill from what it once was. I haven't been back in a long time.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!",
        "Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there.",
        "Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.\\n\\nSorry, Pizza Pit staff. \\n\\n[Cue the Tim & Eric \\\"Ya blew it!\\\" .gif.]",
        "Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !",
        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.",
        "We had Andy as our waiter and he was great! Super helpful with my vegan options, made our night super fun and special. All the staff was very nice and food was just awesome. VEGAN options were fantastic! Drunken noodles was superb, vegan brownie sundae just lovely. Thanks Wazuzu and Steve Wynn for being vegan friendly!",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "All desserts are pretty but they have the same taste. Nothing special. I am portuguese descendent and all food here don't look be prepared from scratch. And the servers take a long time to even notice you are waiting for them seating on a table. They are so inpatient. I have been here 4-5 times and I promise don't come back any more. Only cash or debit card.",
        "Great location, great environment, and great food. Oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended.",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",
        "Food was good TexMex fare.  Margarita was one of the worst I'd ever had.  I was totally dumbfounded that their Margaritas could be so bad. Order a beer and you'll be fine.",
        "Not bad - great location - $1 margaritas (small but yummy); outback steakhouse & denny's is connected to the hotel.  It's a decent place to stay if you just need a place to crash for the night.",
        "Order the ribs only next time",
        "Food is unimpressive.\\n\\nDrinks however.. try the lemonade or the margarita (both with alcohol) and you will not regret it!",
        "Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!",
        "Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.",
        "Excellent experience. Sharon upgraded my already upgraded room.  Next thing I knew, doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine.  Also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything I want along with $120 in breakfast certificate.  \\n\\nAll this is thanks to American Express card.",
        "Pizza is okay NOT THE BEST ..very rude ppl asked for a slice ..they didnt have a slice i had to buy a whole pizza..should consider taking the slices of the menu it happend one time now a second time!! Will never go bak here again!!",
        "This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .",
        "My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \\n\\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.",
        "I definitely get more out of a massage, but for what it is-it's a neat service to have as a walk-in. My back refused to crack because my muscles were so tight, so I didn't feel like I got much out of it. :( my neck popped pretty decent though and I got a good stretching. The doctor was really nice. Next time I will just go get a massage instead...",
        "Poor access from monorail. Poor restaurant qualities and diversity. Poor lobby (only twos gents working at front desk with loads of people in line). Poor bell desk (took 30 mins to get to my room to give me new access cards to give to me to change my room...since the room next to me was noisy with partygoers). Old dirty carpeting. Basic bathroom. Avoid this hotel. Stay at MGM",
        "Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.",
        "This place is a valley institution. Bring cash. Don't feed the pigeons. Outdoor seating but misters help cool in the summer. Their fish is an acquired taste so I understand some of the negative reviews. My wife hates it so I eat here by myself. (She is not a local anyway).  I recommend the 4 piece fish and chips with an extra 2 oz special sauce. I have been eating here since I was a kid and hope to be eating here well into my retirement.",
        "good location.  MAKE MORE CHOC CHIP COOKIES!  this location never has any, but has lots of the kind nobody seems to buy (cranberry, raspberry).  give the people what they want!!  i swear some a-hole comes in and buys the entire tray of choc chip cookies every day.",
        "This place was terrible!!!! DO NOT waste your money!!!! Frozen food, salsa from the jar and chips from the bag! Awful!!!!",
        "I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.",
        "Excellent service and the food ... fabulous!  I had ribs, greens, and cole slaw. Yummy!",
        "What the truck, chuck? \\n\\nel servicio - no bueno\\nla comida - no me gusta\\nla decoracion - una estrella\\nla margarita - una estrella",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Food is pretty normal, ethnic foods aren't to die for and are toned down to meet the tastes of the masses, prime rib is to die for! I went to breakfast and it was alright, now the worst but not the best, four stars because it really is good, but not as great as the other one I went to, it's a fair second though.",
        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "This is a great location on the strip - just a short walk to about any property you want. And the room rates are dirt cheap - $40 on the strip? OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic",
        "let me get straight to the point: don't come here!\\n\\ni paid $38.00 for a mediocre meal...and that was just the lunch price!\\n\\nit's a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasn't amazing at all. the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert bar....\\n\\nrefund please :(",
        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",
        "Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \\nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.",
        "I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.",
        "After a year in Portland, Oregon we have found a single spot for decent BBQ, and it was much more expensive than Joe's for much less food. We will struggle on here in the Rose City (loving the city just not the lack of good BBQ) as we continue to pine away for Joe's...",
        "We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.",
        "Portions were huge!  We ate it all though.  That must have meant the food was tasty.  My wife and I shared one dish, The New Mexican Platter.  We also enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.",
        "Wow.  Amazing food.  The portions were generous and the food amazing.  I recommend the short ribs, really big portions.  My wife got the shrimp and scallops but had them prepare it with olive oil and garlic to avoid the cream sauce (lactose intolerance) and it was delicious.  The beer selection is impressive, I recommend the Porter.  Live music gave it a great atmosphere.",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better.",
        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "This place sells... Yup, you guessed it! Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "The guy working there was nice.\\nTheir food is not great at all.\\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.",
        "Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure.",
        "We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a long weekend and I ended up at Border Grill a couple times.  The 4 stars are really for the weekend brunch - all you can eat tapas that were interesting and (mostly) tasty.  I went back for the margaritas later which were also tasty though not particularly cheap.  You'd think the upstairs patio would be a good place to watch the beach concerts but the waiter said it was too dark to see the stage. Alas.",
        "Went for lunch. Ordered African peanut soup and a salami sandwich. Both were good. BF was less impressed with his schnitzel, he thought the portion size was too small but thought it tasted ok. Would like to try dinner, maybe do a big German meal. Not sure if I can get him to go back, however. A little pricey for meal size. He was still hungry after lunch.",
        "I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long.",
        "Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",
        "Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!",
        "If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \\\"chips\\\", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!\\n\\nHighly recommended for pizza!,",
        "If the main casino isn't quiet enough for you (though that's unlikey!), head upstairs to this sports bar. There is gaming at the bar and a nice selection of draft beer. There are also tables for easy viewing of the many TVs. You must try the $1 cheese pizza slices, which are only available when the kitchen is open (weekends only unless during game season I think). The pizza is great!",
        "We started off with the usual chips and salsas followed by 2-item combinations - enchilada and chile relleno served with refried beans, unadorned salad and Spanish rice.  Though restaurant names differ, the same mediocre Tex-Mex food may be found in most casinos.",
        "It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT?\\n\\nI didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card (proof of address? I don't even know my address), but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway (while cracking the best  worst geek jokes).",
        "It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \\\"OK.\\\"",
        "I think yelp really let me down this time. In my opinion, I think the bar is just trying to be a restaurant. The service was somewhat slow. Arizona has way better Mexican food places than this joint. The chips were stale, and the guacamole was bland with a chunky twist.",
        "OMG, I am so FULL!  Crab Cake and the ribs are my two favorite apps there! Be sure to try them. \\n\\nps...don't fill up on the biscuit!",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Second to Hurley's for good pub grub on lunch. Fish n Chips - with really tasty chips. Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office.",
        "Love me some Yogurtology! Great selection of flavors, most of which are Gluten-free for my darling Celiac boy. They also have the toppings segregated from each other and very clearly labeled. So my seven year old had no trouble distinguishing which ones were safe for him to pile on. We all got different flavors but the stand out was chocolate/coconut swirl. It was divine like a frozen Mounds bar. Worth every penny!",
        "So good! We stopped in for a couple scoops of ice cream and were not disappointed. The toasted coconut is delicious. It's creamy, flavorful, and I thought the serving size was fair. The Vietnamese coffee was also great. If you're a coffee fan, I highly suggest trying it.\\n\\nThe shop is really cute with lots of candy for sale. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.",
        "Chicken schwarma here is fantastic. Best in town. Don't add onions though. Pita chips and hummus are also great.",
        "Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.",
        "My girlfriend and I ate here during Phoenix Restaurant week.  We had rapid and friendly service.  \\n\\nWe had 3 courses and my girlfriend had a Margarita.  Everything had the gooey deliciousness that I expect from Mexican food.   The Chile Colorado had a lot of spice, so come ready for a lot of powerful flavor!",
        "Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste, no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning",

Oozing with filling.\\n Not like what I grew up eating but it made me happy and I would definitely stop by for another one.\\nLove F.A.M.E., I want to decorate my house like that!",
        "I was recently invited by Rubios to celebrate the return of their delicious enchilada's; wow! Thank you for bringing them back. The sauce is what got me hooked. Tip: get a side of the red enchilada sauce to enjoy it with your chips.... Yum!",
        "Gas prices are really good here. Usually I drove a couple blocks more and gas is more expensive than here. Another thing, if you get the rewards card from Food 4 Less and for every $100 of groceries you spend, you get 10\\u00a2 off per gallon, Pretty good I would say!",
        "This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal.",

Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "My husband and I enjoyed the dance performance and the singing.  There were a lot of boobs and I'm glad to see 90% of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts.  It was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid $80 for two people.",

        "I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy....",

        "I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.",
        "Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience.",
        "Beautiful campus!! First time attending and have the pleasure of having two exemplary  professors.  This school has a great culinary arts programs as well as an awesome hospitality program!!\\n\\nLove it!",
        "Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree.",
        "Just like many other Ritas, but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store.  Only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options",
        "Solid, huge hotel.  Our room was in the updated \\\"west wing,\\\" which gets you modern-styled amenities and a small, porthole-like window.\\n\\nLots of dining and lounging choices, with a massive casino and sports book to boot.  There's not much to dislike here, a genuine Vegas Strip experience.  Very convenient, obviously, if you're in town for an event at the arena.",
        "Love this place! So glad that I decided to come here with my friend. Ask for Summer or Kate, they are fabulous and friendly! Love my mani pedi and definitely will be coming back to this cute little place.",
        "Dimly lit restaurant and lounge. Couches. Candles. Hot hot sex. \\n\\nDopest tapas place in Vegas and a well known local spot. Sangrias and Mojitos, fill em up. Have a yourself a good time. Hanging with friends or your lover, you're sure to have an intimate night.\\n\\nSkip the strip, come to Firefly. You'll thank me later.",
        "Overpriced for a hot dog, but you do get a huge ass wiener.\\n\\nI'm a girl that craves nacho cheese after midnight, so the Mojave Dog was the hot dog of choice and boy did it hit the spot.  \\n\\nI'm glad they were open at 2AM  and I didn't have to go looking for a 7-11.  :)",
        "I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.",
        "Just tried to check this one out based on Yelp reviews but they were closed. Sunday morning 8:00 am. Bummer",
        "Great little independent place. The owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking. When in town I try to eat there a few times a month. I don't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly. They have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu. Its hard not to find something you will like.",
        "WARNING*** This business is closed. Me and my wife were going to eat dinner when we realized the place has been seized by the city.",
        "Just passed by this DD the other week, and sad to see it is now CLOSED.  Blame the economy I suppose.",
        "I think the rooms need an update. I mean, for the price, they're not spectacular. Staff were really nice though.\\n\\nThe casino and bar/club/restaurant choices are fine, typical Las Vegas. \\n\\nThe lobby is gorgeous, but you don't have to stay there to see it!",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \\\"Yum\\\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",
        "Came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday, the layout of the club is nice but the place is too packed, lots of older folks and couples as well. as far as the music goes it was okay but I left after 30 minutes.  Waste of 30 dollars in my opinion.",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",
        "I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\\n\\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!",
        "Hey guys I am a manager for Discount Tire. I had my car serviced at Gil's ,there isn't a more honest friendly place to go to for all your auto needs.Ask for Gil or Jameson. I'm glad I found a place with honesty and integrity. It is far a few these days.Give them try you won't regret it.",
        "This place is now closed. Apparently they lost their liquor license and those of us who purchased a Yelp Deal for that place are stuck with a certificate we cannot use. Shame, because I heard so many great things about the food. RIP Antars.",
        "Snagged an online deal for this place after I heard about it from friends; it was really great! The portions were generous, the prices were reasonable and the staff was very kind. They don't have a full bar here though, so plan accordingly.",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "Great place! I'm glad that we pull over here at a right place where we eat our dinner with a cool interior design that will add to your appetite.\\n\\nThe price is also cheaper than the others.\\n\\nCheck this out!",
        "Conveniently located inside of Caesars Palace... However, they're not a part of the Total Rewards program that Caesars is a part of. \\n\\nWhy would this matter? Well, cause you can't claim your free birthday drink here! \\n\\nWhile not my personal favorite, it's not a bad bar to try...",
        "This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \\nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business.",
        "Gave this place a shot because my friends are always raving about it. The hostess was friendly. We sat at the only two open seats at the bar. No greeting or anything so we left after about 8 minutes of awkward waiting. To their defense it was extremely busy. Maybe I'll give it another try when it's not so slammed..",
        "Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. \\n\\nThe Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). \\n\\nThe salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!",
        "This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les \\u00c9clusiers should be a blip on your radar.",
        "Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.",
        "liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda.",
        "Comparatively speaking, Boba Tea House is probably one of the top 5 boba places in Arizona.  With that in mind, I must say their consistency is spot on.  I have been a repeating customer since they opened in the mid-00's, and the quality and service has been the same since day one.  My only critique would be they should have never abandoned the punch card program.  Most, if not all coffee shop I have visited has one, so why not Boba Tea House?",
        "We had Andy as our waiter and he was great! Super helpful with my vegan options, made our night super fun and special. All the staff was very nice and food was just awesome. VEGAN options were fantastic! Drunken noodles was superb, vegan brownie sundae just lovely. Thanks Wazuzu and Steve Wynn for being vegan friendly!",
        "Amore is now closed and the store is cleared out.",
        "Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect.",
        "A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "This place was amazing! I was very impressed, considering it was my first time, all my expectations were met. Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",
        "This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012.",
        "Great coffee!\\nGreat atmosphere!\\nGreat service!\\nSo glad I found this place. Wish I was local.",
        "Hefty portions, great value, homey comfortable service: not overly efficient, but not slow either. Stick to T-Bird specialties and typical fare. Being adventurous doesn't pay here. Ask the waiter what's cooking to find the best options. Pros: Cheap, hefty, homemade feel. Cons: distinct bar atmosphere, poor atypical fare.",
        "Drove by, they are closed :(",
        "Absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine.  The only thing keeping Verizon in business is the good coverage and over-priced calling plans.",
        "I originally came for the pizza, which is excellent, but I keep coming back for the Italian dishes. O am glad I went out on a limb one night and ordered something other than the great pizza. Now I usually just order the evenings special with confidence that it will be great.\\nDon't miss out on the homemade cannoli. They are addictive!",
        "Wasn't impressed. Poorly seasoned steak and slow service. All of the food was just ok. So many better options out there. Quite disappointed.",
        "Always has been a favorite! The management and staff have always been great and do whatever to keep you happy! There is not one bad food item on the menu and everything tastes so good it makes it hard to decide. Their Buffalo Mac and cheese is great, also a fan of their pretzel too. Also all the beer options will keep anyone satisfied.",
        "This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again.",
        "Great location with easy access to monorail, express bus, and bridges to cross busy streets. Good staff and lobby experience. Hotel rooms are very large but the reason for three stars: out-dated tube tvs that have poor reception on half the channels, and a bathtub-shower door combination that is ancient. But I loved the value and the access to Paris Las Vegas and its delectable restaurants. Nice pool.",
        "Beat the heat and head to Jump 'n' Jungle. Feeling stir crazy and want to release some pent up energy, go to Jump 'n' Jungle. On your way home from school and you want to interact with your friends and children, meet up at Jump 'n' Jungle.

        "Been there today. My dog got all exiting , thought he will meet some new friends. Just kids and 1 dog on a leash . I'm still searching for a nice , crazy , open dog park. Where is it just for dogs, and they can run around no leash .",
        "One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!",
        "Went here over the holidays w/my parents, sister, and parents' friends.  This place is definitely a dive.  Good, relaxed atmosphere.  They had a Hawaiian breeze drink special that night--those were good and reasonably priced.  I had wings for dinner--they were mediocre.  Not too spicy.  I am kinda picky about my wings.",
        "They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.",
        "i think this is closed??? their website is suspended?",
        "Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy.",
        "My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",
        "Enjoy the Vietnamese food the staff was friendly huge portions I would definitely get a couple of dishes for 5 friends and everybody share family style.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "We were visiting the area and were able to make a last minute appointment on a Sunday! Our dog was treated royally.  The grooming was fantastic but even better was the attitude of the people there. They were great with our dog and made us feel like long-time friends.",
        "Been there several times.   Greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Servers took orders quickly and knew the menu well.   Specials were related and all questions answered.\\n\\nFood served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.\\n\\nService seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently.",
        "They do not reinforce the curbing, they walk into your backyard at 6am unannounced and almost get shot. They rip up your stake markers for other projects. No one speaks understandable English. There contact at the office had an excuse for everything. Glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed. If you want to waste your time and money use these guys! Otherwise find a good company.",
        "Just popped in here as some of our friends who joined us after work hadn't eaten so for them pizza, for us a glass of wine and beer.",
        "OMG!  My boss took me here for lunch.  You order and pay for your order 1st.  The hamburgers were to die for.  The fries were very good and flavorful.  Fried twinkee is what we got for dessert.  I loved the whole meal and will bring family and friends back for sure.  I will take pictures next time so you can see how much you get for your money.  You will NOT be disapointed.",
        "Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know.",
        "Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here.",
        "Fresh Vegan (cold raw food). Great taste and creativity. I had the Pad Thai and it was delicious. Only it didn't taste anything like real Pad Thai. Nice beer choices. Juices and other 'healthy' beverages are expensive.  All in all I would go again and I recommend you all to try it.",
        "Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \\\"happy hour\\\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!",
        "This place is awesome! The staff greets you right away & seem real genuine! They explained all the menu choices & even offered us some samples of the meat choices. \\nVery nice staff - excellent food - I'm craving this place right now - back to Vegas real soon!!!\\nPinball Hall of Fame + Tacos Tijuana = Heaven :))))\\nSee you soon!",
        "Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \\n\\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\\n\\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.",
        "Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.",
        "Glad to c another restaurant with some raw food options.  Would be nice if they had some fresh pressed green juices and some raw salad options.",
        "We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!",
        "I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!",
        "This Club was my favorite . Very entertaining! I thought I'm too old for clubbing but my friends and I were static and had a fantastic night !!!",
        "Not my favorite Hilton but I appreciate that the hotel is on the far end of the strip with no casino. Made it seem more like a relaxing vacation. The rooms were affordable in price but the spa is a different story. We're Hilton fans and will visit this hotel again.",
        "Dr Rusick is awesome! I was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him. After just a few appointments I was feeling much better.  Dr Rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem.",
        "Returned for another dinner with friends last night... \\nWhile the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.\\n\\nI don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!",
        "Show is absolutely fantastic. Great show & great skits.. highly recommended. Only suggestion I would def. Give is to purchase the upgraded seats for the additional $25.. trust me you'll be glad you did... If your the type to get offended by swears and vulgarity this show might not be for you... def. Made for 18+.. Alot of funny sexual contents...",

        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well. I love to get the chicken bowl because their burritos are too big and messy. I'd never had a problem with this place and they always give great customer service.",
        "Stand up guys. Scott took care of me and didn't pressure me into any repairs. He was kind enough to quote the needed repairs and offered to just do the bare minimum (safely of course) to get me back on the road.  I'll be referring friends to this shop so long as they are in business.",
        "Bummer. I was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich. Stopped by Friday 7/27 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows.",

        "We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.  When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.  Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.  Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.",
        "This place is super sketchy! \\n\\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night."

I don't come here often but it's hard not to take advantage of this deal. I always add some biscuits, they are delicious. Their chicken seems to be consistent  and  service is average for a drive thru place.",

        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",

Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.",

        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",

I've had the Fresh Fruit & Chicken Salad and the Southwest Salad.  The salads were large and filling and the ingredients were fresh.  I've also had the tomato basil soup and it was all right but a little on the oily side.  Service is friendly and welcoming.",

        "This is a great place to go without having to drive too far!  I go to the one on Rittenhouse.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff.  The outdoor patio is nice with the great weather we have been getting.  Pretty happening on a late Friday or Saturday, actually this place always seems busy.  I haven't personally tried the food yet, but menu offers a diverse selection and it all looks pretty good.  Definitely worth checking out.",
        "Mediocre Chinese food. The quality of food was not so good. The service was even worse. The bill was not calculated correctly. And the waiter was not there when we need him.

Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls.",

I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.",
        "Wish I could give 0 stars. I reached at 7:45 pm and the lady at the counter rudely said they are closed, even though the sign outside said Open and closing time is stated as  8pm.

We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",

BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.",
        "I would say that this is easily the best place to go in in Sun Prairie.  We have been here about 6 times and it has consistently been good.  I have ordered steak, fried fish, entrees... it's all pretty good.  The kids meals are well portioned and the kids eat it.  They rotate their menu and the beer on tap - that makes repeat business worth while.  It can be pretty busy on a Friday night.  They have filled a need in town.",

That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.",

Drunken noodles are my favorite and if you get them Thai hot, be prepared to do some sniffling. They mean HOT!! Great service the couple of times I've eaten there for lunch.

Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",

One of my favorite things about this bar is that I can go and have a great night out and not worry about spending too much money!",

This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!!!!!",
        "I play slots at the Rio the service gets worse ever time Im there!\\nThere is service from the cocktail servers in the afternoon. the employees rather visit with each other than take care of the guest. \\nI played for two hours never got offered one water! Theres no excuse for this neglect.\\nThe severn star guests playing next to me weren't happy either!",
        "Poor access from monorail. Poor restaurant qualities and diversity. Poor lobby (only twos gents working at front desk with loads of people in line). Poor bell desk (took 30 mins to get to my room to give me new access cards to give to me to change my room...since the room next to me was noisy with partygoers). Old dirty carpeting. Basic bathroom. Avoid this hotel. Stay at MGM",
        "WOW, times must be truly hard if they aren't able to fill a Cirque du Soleil stadium on a Saturday night in the prime section. We went last minute because the young man wanted to watch it again and boy I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it even the 2nd time round. We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around.",
        "Everytime I go to Vegas we stay at different hotels just so we can try them out and find the right hotel. MGM was pretty nice but the room we had which was the Celebrity Spa Suite had outdated furniture.\\n\\nI still had a good time. This casino is huge! Lots of places to visit and the monorail is in this casino as well. Food court and all. So pretty much everything you need is in this hotel. Tabu Lounge, Studio 54 and much more.",
        "This is a great location on the strip - just a short walk to about any property you want. And the room rates are dirt cheap - $40 on the strip? OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "I wasnt expecting this place to be a Fairmont reunion site, but it was a pleasant surprise, it seems like a lot of my co-workers go here, quite frequently, and it just reminds me of the local bar scene. \\nThe drinks are affordable, theres a smoking section on the patio (yessssssss) and the appetizers are worth trying. The service can be hit or miss, but I'll definitely be checking this place out again.",
        "I have stayed at LVH twice previously with Hubby and had pretty good experiences, but last time we went, you can definitely feel the wear and tear. The tub was dripping all night, the elevators, hallway, and room looks worn and dated, and just gives an overall meh feel to the guests. Thanks LVH for the budget rooms for the past years, but I think I'll check into another hotel on the strip next time I'm in Vegas.",
        "We heard great things about this place and decided to give it a shot for breakfast and we were sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre and was served lukewarm. The service was slow and inconsistent. We had to request our check from the host stand since the waitress never returned, the owner was visiting most of the tables, but never stopped by ours, and the price was expensive for what we got. The only upside was the french toast special we split was yummy.",
        "Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!",
        "I bought a Groupon for a one-hour massage. I had a choice between a therapeutic, acupressure, and Swedish. Since I don't like to be petted and am super ticklish, I went for a therapeutic one. Stephanie was amazing. She did a great job loosing up the knots I have in my shoulder area and she stretched me well too. I am very happy with the service I received. I would definitely recommend this place!",
        "I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.",
        "Gigantic tourist trap, but I suppose it's fun for the kids. Pretty much M&M logos plastered on every item imaginable, but the wall of M&Ms is pretty impressive. If you only want a few candies, get them somewhere else, as waiting in the lines to check out can take a while, and $12.99/lb for M&Ms isn't a great deal. Good to go to at least once, I suppose.",
        "Very glad to have found and chosen this salon. Sign up was very easy, everyone I've met has been wonderful and helpful, and it's a national company so you can visit ANY palm beach tan in country. Lotion is a little pricey in-store, though.",
        "Fatburger wouldn't be my first choice for lunch.  First of all, the burger is kind of expensive.  Secondly, it's not that great.  Although, it looks delicious.  \\n\\nWhen I went in all I wanted was a cheeseburger with the works.  I felt like I was signing up for life insurance.  They kept bombarding me questions.  Just do it right and stop making things so complicated.  It's supposed to be fast food.",
        "Good food! BYOB. Probably won't return here again because as we (party of 5) were finishing the last half of our bottle after dessert,  the host came over & said \\\"I'm not kicking you out but we have another party waiting for this table so....\\\"   It was awkward & unprofessional & left us all with a bad taste in our mouth.  No one likes to be rushed out after a nice meal!",
        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "Not worth it. Some weird, offensive smell throughout entire hotel. Gym was packed constantly. Way more kids at resort than I expected.  \\nLobby and bar area, pretty. Golf prices, just too high.\\nHotel leaves a message at your  room saying \\\"come down and pick up your free gift\\\" but your free gift is really a ploy to get you to buy a timeshare. BRUTAL!",
        "Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "I don't wear suits often, so I totally appreciated their advise on what will make me look my best.  Extremely professional, and they really know their stuff.  After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit.",
        "One of my staples for my old school Vegas days. I used to come here a LOT, because I could charge everything on the room and it wouldn't be TOO expensive. Had breakfast the other day...quite a good version of the standard staple of Steak and Eggs.  Minus a star for it being $20 though....this is Vegas, its only supposed to be $9.99.  \\n\\nI did love that the waitress brought some Heinz 57 though.",
        "Suggestions :\\n\\nBook an Appointment. \\nHave a lowered car?  \\nDefinetely book an appointment in advance. \\n\\nAndre was honest when I got in. He said he would try to squeeze me into their time slot. Dealership quality service at a small shop location. Will probably do my major work at this location.",
        "We tried this twice since it was in our hotel... it was kind of ghetto and trashy and the people weren't very friendly (we were basically told we couldn't stand anywhere except the dancefloor). Nice music and free drinks some nights but otherwise not worth it, there are so many better clubs closeby!",
        "Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!",
        "Nice, convenient location in uptown. I went in just to see what the deals were and what was in the pre-made entrees section of the store. There was a pretty good selection but nothing that really grabbed my attention so I walked out and went to a more appetite appeasing restaurant.",
        "Decent hotel. Nice people. Rooms are good. Restaurant food & service is good. But the wifi is impossibly slow in the bedrooms. Hilton has a wifi upgrade that you pay are supposed to pay for. The keep the so-called complementary wifi annoyingly slow. As a business traveler these days you need wifi and I will not stay at hotels that make you pay for wifi.",
        "The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!",
        "This restaurant has never fail on my Dinner every time I go  with my family the food is always delicious and a great experience  \\nI'm very happy with Yesterday Dinner was Delicious \\nThe restaurant was very clean \\nThe host,waitress ,and the rest of the staff was very nice specially a Spanish speaker man he took care of Us and made sure we had everything we needed",
        "For being surrounded by two lakes, Madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water. Head down to McFarland and check out the beach house. It's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake. Tons of windows. Not a bad place.\\n\\nCan't comment on the food. Drink specials were solid.",
        "We called for hotel reservations.  I can't believe how I was spoken to.  The young lady must have had chip on her shoulder.  I guess she thought I was supposed to be serving her.  I hope the stay is more enjoyable than the reservation experience.\\n\\nJohnny J..",
        "Pizza was good, a little pricy for pizza. Hubby was disappointed they don't serve beer, or coffee. Decent service just wasn`t expecting to spend $100+ on wings and 2 pizzas.",
        "I did my grocery shopping mostly here while I was on vacation. It got the job done but is nothing special. The produce section was smaller then I would have liked but they have a whole aisle for healthy more organic options. Staff is not very friendly. Meh, gets the job done but nothing to ride home about",
        "Another trip to Vegas, another trip to McCarran.  \\n\\nI don't hate it, but its never going to be one of my favorite airports.  I just don't understand why they don't open their security check points till almost 5am?!?  Every trip out here, I get to the security area too damn early and then have to wait outside.  \\n\\nAt least there's good food and slot machines once I get inside.",
        "It's food is over priced and the atmosphere is loud and chaotic. Even though there is an 'adult section', just consider this mainly a hot spot for kids and immature teenagers.",
        "They have a good selection. Servers are friendly. Food is great except the limited selection for desserts. The last time I went there, the servers at the dessert section were chit-chatting. They know people were waiting but acted like they didn't noticed.",
        "Usually I LOVE MC but today was NOT one of those tumes. Shepherds pie has too hot to eat..way too hot..the Caesar salad was filled with brown lettuce,  the dressing was sour and my pumpkin pie was burnt and tough. My server was nice but inattentive.  I was SO looking forward to eating here but spent way too much money on..well basically apathetic foid and service.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT",
        "Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.",
        "I signed up for a 30 min massage, I was not impressed. \\n\\nThe upstairs has leaks in the ceiling.  Additionally, when you are in the massage area, you can hear everything that is going on downstairs--which is not even mildly relaxing. \\n\\nAs far as massage....I've had better at a fraction of the price.",
        "This place is really cool--kind of gives the \\\"dinner on the dock\\\" feel of SF, but it's inexpensive and casual. There is no indoor seating, so mind the weather before you head out there. It's kind of hidden so make sure you read the directions on where to go!\\n\\nService is comparable to any other bar/sports bar kind of joint, and the laid back atmosphere is part of that.",
        "The best thing about this place is 24 hour delivery.  However, there is always at least one thing messed up with my order.  They just don't seem to pay attention when you order.  The order I just received was supposed to have hash browns with my burrito and I got home fries.  I do enjoy their breakfast so I will probably order again but I just need to make sure they read my order back to me before I hang up...",

        "With Walmart being so big, they lack customer service. Pressed for assistant more than 3x at the fabric section and no one showed up. They just keep losing sales over and over. Will it ever get better??!!!! Such a disappointment.",
        "They can't get the orders right.  I always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru. They're open late, but they have no lights on at night. Poor service. I'd rather go to Sonic's down the street.  This Mc Donald's needs improvement.  Bad",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "I finally ate all the food I got from Siu Wok the other day and want to give it more stars.  Everything really was delicious.  I don't know if I'll ever know what \\\"authentic\\\" chinese food is supposed to taste like but as far as what I consider to be Chinese food, it was all top notch.  Exceeded my expectations for an Arizona Downtown Chinese delivery joint.  I'll be ordering from them again very soon.",
        "SUPER PACKED!!! \\n\\nthere's a stage with velvet red curtains. we had a VIP table but even the VIP section was overcrowded! \\n\\ndon't get me wrong, i still had fun. but there were just too many damn people!!!!!!!",
        "Note that this is now the \\\"Desert Rose Resort\\\".  I've stayed here several times over the years, and consider it one of the very best deals for basic condo-style rooms within walking distance of the Strip. You can walk to the Tropicana, the MGM Grand, and the monorail stop behind the MGM.",
        "This place is flat-out AWFUL!  Long line to get in the bar, and had to pay.  Lame.  Music was whack with a bunch of ugly fat chicks dancing on stage.  The offer \\\"free shots\\\", but they're just pouring bottom-shelf liquor into your mouth.  When I ordered my drink, the snobby bartender told me I needed to tip her.",
        "Four Stars for Vegas Breakfast.  Had the Breakfast special.  It was a fantastic bargain for $3.95.  Only a few paces away at the MGM where I was staying and would have paid 3 or 4 times that much.  It was busy, but the staff did well despite being overwhelmed.",
        "Love this place!  They always have great beers on tap & the lil pig sandwich is plenty of food for lunch or dinner. We take my Dad here when he comes in from KC and he likes the BBQ.",
        "This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!",
        "My hubby and I love the food and staff here. And the bakery stuff are awesome. Small friendly warm restaurant.",
        "Poor service - Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent.",
        "Burlesque part of show is okay, nothing great. There were two comedians at the 9pm show and one was so -so while the headliner was pretty good. Show was an hour...expected it to be longer. Unless you buy a groupon for $15 with the one free drink, I wouldn't waste your money or time.  Brad Garret's comedy club at MGM is much better.",
        "The people that work here are rude! SFO definitely way better.",
        "Had to wait 25 minutes to eat, which isn't a big deal, but my girlfriend and I were forgot about and skipped multiple times. Also the hostess had an attitude about it... We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food, man? Good pizza, but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better.",
        "This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs.",
        "Too many slots, and not well laid out. There are very few table games, so the few they have tend to be overcrowded. The bars were overpriced and understocked. There was a three-hour wait to get into the restaurants, but they wouldn't take reservations before hand. For my first trip to a casino, it was fun for a while, but that quickly wore off. I wouldn't be inclined to hurry back.",
        "I am from Missouri, the land of Steak 'N Shake.  I was excited when they announced plans to open a restaurant in Vegas... I thought it would be a taste of home.  However, this is NO real Steak 'N Shake.  The food and service is very inconsistent.  I keep coming back and hoping it will be better, but sadly, it isn't.  Cold burgers and fries, watery shakes, rude waitresses...",
        "This buffet is very strong with food quality and comfort. The buffet has a great feel to it and doesnt look like a buffet when you are seated and see big windows. The good is good and has a big meat and cheese section. However the selections are fairly limited and it is a little smaller compared to a lot of other places you will see in town. The deserts are excellent though.",
        "Horrible pizza. Extremely inconsistent. Every once in awhile you will get a good slice if you come mid day but if you order a whole pizza prepare for disappointment.\\n\\nHowever...awesome hot Italian Sub.\\n\\nHe Cheeseseak is dry and does not contain much meat.",

They took off their best appetizer queso fundido, service was slow, no longer 24hours, and they barely comp drinks for players,got hasseled everytime I ordered a.drink and I was playing maMuch better options in town, no point of wasting time or money herex credits and fast. there are much better options in town, no point of wasting money or time here",
        "While the food is good, the service is average to poor and they tack on a \\\"CNF\\\" fee with no explaination.  Our check was $74.65 pre tax with an extra $3.51 CNF charge.  Additionally, we booked out table with Open Table (for the points) and they cancelled my reservation after we arrived and said the reservation never existed when I called later.  Overall very pricey and average experience but good people watching.",
        "I came here for lunch on Sunday and for some reason they did not have any crab legs.  How can you not serve crab legs??\\n\\nEvery time I go to a buffet, I must eat the prime rib.  And their prime rib was OK.  A few things that stood out were the lobster ravioli, shrimp and peso pizza, and the french toast station.  They have a big dessert section.  But no cones for ice cream!",
        "It's not that bad during their happy hours. The beer deals are pretty good. I tried the yak burger and it was \\\"meh\\\".\\n\\nThe place does get pretty crowded and hence sometimes seating might be an issue. Its just loud enough (so that you don't have to scream at each other) if you aren't in the very back section. The half price wine nights are pretty good too.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating.\\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars.",

        "I know I'm supposed to like the O and that it's a tradition, but honestly, the food is not all that good.  I like the fries, they are better than average, and the portions are huge.  My cheesesteak sandwich was not even average, and the portion of meat was very skimpy.",

The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",

I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",

Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",
        "I loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and I ate it two days in a row. This time I feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. I ordered 4 Earl's club sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -NADA! It also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. Eh I am officially sick of this place. I will not crave for it next time.",

I used to hang out with work friends for \\\"happy hour\\\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table.

Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "In my opinion, this is the best Portuguese bakery in Montreal. Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth!

        "This is my absolute favorite place to hunt for first edition Dr Seuss books. The owners are so very kind and everytime I go they have no problem helping me dig through the childrens books and they always know off the top of their head just how many Dr Seuss books they have so we aren't looking for no apparent reason. \\n\\nI'll always have fond memories of this place providing me with my very first 1st edition Dr Seuss book ;}",
        "They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??",
        "This is good old school Italian. For $32 We got soup (delicious minestrone) or salad, garlic bread, very good veal parmigiana, a full liter of house wine and a delicious cappuccino for dessert. It was worth the cost.",
        "It was okay.  Can't compare to Ike's sandwich.  I had the pastrami rueben, very disappointed... Not even two layers of meat.   My sandwich was sad, which made this visit and experience sad.  Line was long and wait after ordering was long, you would think that the long wait meant good food, but it was completely opposite.\\n\\nA second visit would require me to be completely wasted.",
        "Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! \\n. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's.",
        "I love all things Cirque du Soleil but this is my absolute favorite! I love Michael Jackson and they did a fantastic job in bringing these two worlds together! I was moved to tears-I actually cried watching this show. It's beautiful, fun, emotional- His music combined with the amazing choreography of dancers, gymnasts, everything - just awesome! I don't want to spoil it but you have to see it! This is a definite must see show!",
        "We had their special Tomahawk steak $98, Glazed Sea Bass $39, sides with asparagus $14, and hand cut fries $12. We don't eat our food bland, in fact slightly on the salty side, but all the food here was just a bit too salty. It will definitely spike your blood pressure. The best part of this experience was the ambiance. Definitely chic and their bathroom is really different.",
        "$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us.",
        "The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.",

        "Ordered the steak and eggs breakfast at 3AM after clubbing. Ordered over-easy eggs and they came out looking like rubber and way over cooked. The steak was ordered to be medium rare, but was well-done. I guess that's what you get for ordering $7 steak and eggs. \\n\\nLuckily, I also ordered the chicken soup which was the best thing I had there that morning.",
        "I ordered the $39.99 all you can eat meat; all of the meats were very dry!! The worst of the worst was the lamb, dry as hell and very gamey tasting. The worst lamb I've ever had. The acceptable items were the flank steak and the turkey wrapped in bacon, but not by much. \\n\\nDon't wast your time, money, or the opportunity to eat somewhere else.",
        "I saw this show while I was in Vegas for Thanksgiving. Mom and I were looking for shows that were going on, and there weren't that many. But Legwarmers caught I am a big fan of the 80s, even though I was born in the 80's. I did think it was a bit cheesy at some parts, but it was enjoyable to a point. Don't think I'll be coming back soon though.",
        "How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40.",
        "We totally pigged out here!  A great alternative to Vegas buffet.  The Garlic Noodles are so yummy.  The BBQ chicken pizza is not bad either.  Even my preschooler found the food tasty.  The atmosphere is casual and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  It could be a bit loud, but worked out well since my kid was watching a video on the ipad.",
        "Got delivery of a pepperoni calzone and four cheese pizza. They were alright, though I think they would've certainly been better if eaten at the place and not after delivery time elapsed.\\n\\nIt costs about $35, which compared to Atlas' deal of getting two larges for under $30, wasn't a great deal. Would probably go with Atlas again next time.",

I've had many bad experiences and they were able to not only fix my eyebrows but have done an outstanding clean up every time.

        "Came here in July. It was hot. Not just hot but hot as hell. That was inside. On the balcony. There was a cool view of downtown Fremont. But it is even hotter. I was in there looking for air conditioning vents. The bar was OK. Nothing real special besides the view of the Fremont. I would return in a cooler month if i am downtown again. The music was good. That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.",
        "For me, this is heaven. \\n\\nI love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display. It truly makes me happy. The very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back.

        "This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home.",
        "Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)",
        "I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season.  The place was empty and we got free upgrades.  The show was amazing.  The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw.  There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",

I like a family atmosphere and here that's what you get. Everbody wants you to succeed in all of your goals , its more than just a work out. CrossFit is not for everyone but if you wanna see what your made of start here.",
        "I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.",
        "I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.",

My only complaint is that like all the other car washes they try to up sell you on services - but that didn't happen today. \\nGive them a try and I think you will be pleased",
        "Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time.",
        "I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business.",

We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah.",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "My boyfriend and I ate here because we had a giftcard, and thank goodness we did, I would never of paid for the food otherwise.

If you can get pass that the store is really ok.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish.

Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",

        "This place is decent.  Bike-themed insides.  The decor didn't overwhelm me with awesomeness and I am not sure I'll be dying to go back any time soon, but the food was great. I had a burger with Black & Tan onion rings, and we had the hummus to start.  All very good, and good specials on beers, of which there is a good variety, during Happy Hour.",

They told me they will have a terrace for this summer :)  the great thing is they  change the table d'h\\u00f4te several times during the week so you don't get bored of the same menu. Finally great food with a great price .",

Pho was alright, but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoiled.\\n\\nHorrible, no. Below average, yes.",
        "My family and I tried this for the first time about a week ago. The food was unique, and very good for adults, but my kids freaked out about it.

The strip steak was sooooo bad, I finally asked to have it taken away and removed from my bill after the kitchen made2 efforts to correct it. My wifes salmon was dry.

The tables are sticky and the bathroom door is black and it is not the paint.  However the food is great and mostly (emphasis on mostly) fresh.  Don't come here if you are looking for a pleasant atmosphere and it is probably better to get your food to go!",
        "Horrible atmosphere, waiters left dirty dishes on one of the three islands/pantry in the middle of the restaurant. (Which is weird enough....that you can see opened very cans of soda and cut up lime and lemons that have been sitting out for who knows how long). Horrible service. Horrible attitude waiters. Would never go back. I am surprised that this chain has not been shut down.",
        "Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.

Room was not cleaned despite calling room service twice. Light switches in room did not work. Either all lights on or off.

Yeah, too busy because we just tripled the occupancy of your bar.  Also,  we asked to put on espn and we were told it would take 10 minutes to change the channel.  Haha!

        "Went to eat at 12:30pm on Friday after thanks giving, wait time was 40-45 mins which is okay. They were charging 50 bucks per person as they were starting dinner at 1pm.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! Who eats dinner at 1pm??? RIDICULOUS.. never going back there..",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "This location is alright. Most of the staff members are actually quite nice, and they've made my many experiences here enjoyable and easy. I just wish they had just as much items as Costco :( Other than that, this place is alright. It can get crowded a little and sometimes not a lot of check out places are open, so lines are long. \\n\\nI'd still shop around here, since it's the nearest location.",
        "Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\\n\\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed.",
        "Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \\n\\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\\n\\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)",
        "No, No, No.\\nI was expecting far better. While the service was better than the meal, I must say all I was, was disappointed. Tinoco's has become similar to a diner, with better than the average diner's pasta.",
        "I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \\n\\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great!

        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "Heavenly!!!\\n\\nI was there last weekend and once again it was amazing. Wynn by is one of my favorite place to stay at in Vegas (Bellagio is the other). The staff is amazing, the hotel is amazing, the service is amazing, the food is amazing and the gambling is great. \\n\\nThank You",
        "Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!",
        "Yuck. This was the worst pho I have ever had. Bad broth, ugly meat, wilted veggies. Service was awful. The dude up front was coughing violently, and blowing his nose. Go to Khai Hoan. I feel sick right now and may have food poisoning-\\n\\n-Update\\nI definitely got food poisoning from Pho All Seasons-",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "The food is good. I've  never had the sushi but Ive heard  it's very good. I only gave 3 stars bc the service is AWFUL   The manager is a pompous asshole,  Is annoyed at life And  doesn't care if you have a complaint. Acts like your disrupting his life if you have a concern. \\nI've eaten here and had a few good experiences but I've also has really awful experiences as well and haven't been back",
        "The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the\\nPrice, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!\\nI would not go there again for sure!",

        "This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere. \\nI highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \\nI'm always looking to add a little something.",
        "The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \\\"MANAGERS\\\" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit.",

        "Bull shit customer service. Although I still go 3 times a month. Bull shit. Customer service. \\nOh and did u know: you cant bring pastries or any outside food into this place? Even though you order like five things. Lmfao. \\nI need to find a new place. -.-",
        "Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect.",
        "I recently got into doing triathlons. Finding a good tri store I thought would be hard, but the staff at tribe has been helpful every time I come in. They are loaded with all the workout goodies, which I love... Though my wallet may not.\\nIf you are looking for any gear for swim, bike, or run this is a good spot!",
        "Another place I tried in Vegas hoping for good jjambbong and unfortunately, this place is just about average as well. The broth can have more flavor and the noodle quality isn't all that great. This is, however, one of the better bowls of jjambbong in Vegas. I would choose to go here over Greenland Supermarket or Jin Mee at convention center. \\n\\nI suggest this place particularly for their lunch specials. Great deals and pretty good food.",
        "Regular run of the mill place.  Sufficient enough for the co-eds that run this street.  Was surprised that they didn't offer any taco or enchilada dinners, everything was just a la carte.  Drink special were reasonable.  Staff courteous.  \\n\\nI have nothing against homeless people, but the parking lot is crawling with beggers.  If you aren't happy with your meal, feed them!",
        "amazing service & incredible rooms, amenities, facilities. worth every penny, highly recommend! some (not all) of the on-site restaurants are pretty good too...",
        "Nice people; Inconsistent haircuts\\n\\nI like the shop and the people.  It can be a little busy, so you know they are doing something well.  Prices are reasonable and it's a chance to watch some sports or an action flick while you get a trim.\\n\\nOnly knock is that I get a different haircut each time.  Same instructions, but depending on the person and the day, I can come out looking quite a bit different.",
        "8 of us just finished eating here.  Service was very friendly, prices were definitely reasonable, and we all really enjoyed our meals. \\n\\nI would come back again for sure!\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn't snap any photos of our food, but here are a few of the place.",
        "It was our first time eating here. The food was just tooooo salty for my taste such as the cream spinach and tacos. The Kobe beef was tough in texture. The strawberries were tart and not sweet. You could see that there were a lot of the staff  in the dining room area chatting amongst themselves. Overall experience was poor. It was a waste of  my money. Will not recommend.",
        "Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.",
        "Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil... First, the seats that we had (on the side), although at the third row, didn't allow us to see the performance as a whole. The few acrobatics were impressive but very limited. The interaction with the public was good but maybe to much at times.\\n\\nIt's a good entertainment just not what I expected from the Cirque du Soleil.",
        "Just opened following winter over seeding. Course played surprisingly well. Tees and fairways were in good shape. The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \\\"automatic 2-putt\\\" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again.",
        "The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\\n\\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.",
        "Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\\n\\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \\n\\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.",
        "I play slots at the Rio the service gets worse ever time Im there!\\nThere is service from the cocktail servers in the afternoon. the employees rather visit with each other than take care of the guest. \\nI played for two hours never got offered one water! Theres no excuse for this neglect.\\nThe severn star guests playing next to me weren't happy either!",
        "A friend told me about this place after my regular hairstylist moved back to Canada. I was very impressed with Molly Rose! She did an awesome job with my cut and color. She is my new go-to-hair expert! I got tons of compliments after going to see her.",

He is rude and obviously has no children of his own. I will no longer be seeing this Doctor because I feel we have been in a verbally abusive relationship and are finally free of the bullying despite his education.",
        "This place seemed like a typical diner but beware, it was not.\\n\\nThe cups were dirty (old lipstick) and my side of peaches came with a moldy piece the waitress, Pam, tried to convince me was a 'mushroom'.\\n\\nAfter a disgusting experience, at no point did the manager come over or the waitress apologize.\\n\\nI would not recommend this place to anyone and if I could rate below one star, I would.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.",

        "Yesterday 4 of my friends went to this place. Just 2 of us drank a coffee and ate a crepe and we got sick a few hours later. Really bad food poisoning that lasted several hours.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews but I think this is something people should know.",

        "Everytime I go to Vegas we stay at different hotels just so we can try them out and find the right hotel. MGM was pretty nice but the room we had which was the Celebrity Spa Suite had outdated furniture.\\n\\nI still had a good time. This casino is huge! Lots of places to visit and the monorail is in this casino as well. Food court and all. So pretty much everything you need is in this hotel. Tabu Lounge, Studio 54 and much more.",
        "Dude, LAX sucks.  It's like a hallway packed with sweaty old men, plus a balcony with more sweaty old men staring down.\\n\\nThey have absolutely no line system.  That just packs everyone into the \\\"waiting area\\\" until someone pushes and shoves their way through the entrance and slips the bouncer a twenty.\\n\\nI know it's Vegas and I have to lower my standards, but LAX just sucks donkey balls.  Sweaty ones.  Gross.",
        "I just wanted a smoothie.  The place is dead at 3 am yet it takes 20 minutes to take the order.  Another 15 minutes to blend it and put it in a cup bc the employees are too busy chatting.  One employee hitting on the cashier.  Not that the cashier was too bright.. she forgot she was making it.  So stupid.  Hope management cleans house",
        "This review is based on a lazy Saturday brunch the weekend before New Years'. I was surprised at how slow it was given that the Strip seemed busy.  Outdoor seating, breakfast all day, and full bar made up my mind about where to eat.  \\n\\nThe food quality was about comparable to Denny's. \\nThe coffee was a little weak but fresh.\\nPortions were generous.\\nService was friendly. \\nI'd go again.",
        "I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings.",

        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "I wasnt expecting this place to be a Fairmont reunion site, but it was a pleasant surprise, it seems like a lot of my co-workers go here, quite frequently, and it just reminds me of the local bar scene. \\nThe drinks are affordable, theres a smoking section on the patio (yessssssss) and the appetizers are worth trying. The service can be hit or miss, but I'll definitely be checking this place out again.",

I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.\\n\\nGo on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.",
        "let me get straight to the point: don't come here!\\n\\ni paid $38.00 for a mediocre meal...and that was just the lunch price!\\n\\nit's a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasn't amazing at all. the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert bar....\\n\\nrefund please :(",
        "One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious.",
        "Returned for another dinner with friends last night... \\nWhile the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.\\n\\nI don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!",

        "Not too impressed.  The service was so-so and no one helped us with how to do this.  At previous Mongolian places I had put the sauce in the bowl.  The cook yelled at me for doing this saying it would all cook away (?) He made me get more in the little cup and it ended up so strong I could hardly eat it.  The atmosphere is sorta cold.  Idk...we just didnt care for it much =(",

        "In my opinion, this is the best Portuguese bakery in Montreal. Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth! Obrigado!",

Now I usually just order the evenings special with confidence that it will be great.\\nDon't miss out on the homemade cannoli. They are addictive!",
        "I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh.",
        "Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\\n\\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\\n\\nRun away -",
        "Man pho was bad yesterday. I hate to rip on my people but they need to step it up. Noodle tasted like one of those instant pho from Lee Lee's supermarket and was extra soggy. I could have sworn the \\\"special combination\\\" was a lot better last time. The fatty piece they added into the special combination tasted weird. Won't be coming back anytime soon until I see better reviews.",
        "Been coming to this burger joint for over 20 years - back when it was in Scottsdale. Each summer we travel to the PHX area to stay for a couple weeks... Every year we come here at least once. In all those years I have never had a bad experience. Burgers are always spot on, delicious, and fresh. Great character, too! Love the Chuck Box!",
        "This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .",
        "Used to have to come here to pick up coffee for my lazy boss but after switching jobs realized I was right next door and have now been coming every day for nearly a year. \\n\\nWard and Monica are great. They will let you try stuff, explain coffee stuff, and recommend stuff. \\n\\nEveryone loves the kale but the stalker and squashed mango are my favorites.",
        "Omg horrible service never coming back here again! I've given this place plenty of shots to prove me wrong but it just keeps getting worse and worse this time they took 20 minutes to sit us than another hour for me to get my food. The place was not even that busy. I'm done here!",
        "Used my Groupon for a massage and blow out. Massage was very relaxing. Shampoo and style were ok. Stylist was a little slow to style my hair, as he was using a blow dryer that wasn't very powerful. Overall a pleasant experience. Friendly staff and central location. I will book a repeat appointment.",
        "They do not reinforce the curbing, they walk into your backyard at 6am unannounced and almost get shot. They rip up your stake markers for other projects. No one speaks understandable English. There contact at the office had an excuse for everything. Glad we kicked them to the curb before the project was completed. If you want to waste your time and money use these guys! Otherwise find a good company.",
        "New to area and saw a coupon in one of our mails. Decided to take my daughter to check it out we got there at 9:29 pm and it looked like they were closing,  the open sign was shut off and the screens were down. Even though yelp says they close at 10. Bad first impression will stick with Froyona.",
        "I'm sorry but I feel absolutely sick from the cigar smoke coming in the doors here from their patio, headache too!\\n\\nI must say I'm very impressed with how John the proprietor and owner responded to my comment in such a positive way! Worth another try.... Thanks!",
        "The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\\n\\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \\n\\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations.",
        "I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!",
        "I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience.  The bartenders are always friendly - and in the dinning room, Jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you.   Also, way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip.",
        "Could not get into the Black Bear diner so we started looking around for a place to have breakfast before we started a trip.  Came across this place and it was not crowded, although the food is good enough for it to be crowded.  Have the breakfast sandwich. It was great.   The country potatoes are not that could, so stick with the hash browns.   Nice spot.  Will come again.",
        "I have to say this is the most educated piercing staff in arizona, I have been getting piercings from them since I turned 18 in 1997 at the tempe location. The only location and I will go to in the Uptown location and Marilyn is amazing when it comes to jewelry placement and always has the prettiest jewely. luv hey",
        "Great job with great service. Nice atmosphere with good people. Had a good time and was treated great. Definitely coming back. Not just a normal nail spot.",

        "I just called the Rolfs Salon at Gainey Village, what happened to Delores Leiva? Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.",
        "love this place! very friendly and did a great job on my nails. I came here with my mother and wife and we were all taken care of very well.\\neven though I was suckered in to coming here the owners were funny and made it easy to relax.",
        "Good food, but dining in isn't recommended! I'll stick to delivery next time! Parents were craving Chinese and from our experience from delivery the food was good but didn't think dining in would be that bad! .... They should just be a delivery resto, no dining in.",
        "Their products, service and prices are phenomenal. Their product prices got my business and their prompt and courteous customer service and amazing product quality will keep me coming back. I know that once my order is placed I don't need to worry - it will done correctly and on time!",
        "What a bad experience! We were just coming along for some nice after marathon Dinner when the wait was 40 minutes. Mike, the MANAGER, was rude and was turning people away left and right. We never had 1 official server. Waiting for the food that takes 30 minutes while everyone is standing around.. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!! If i could give no stars I definitely would!",
        "This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",
        "Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!",
        "I have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality Mexican food, and for the price, you can't beat it! I recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos.",
        "A friend recommended this place while I was visiting Madison. I was hesitant because it's a chain but she highly recommended. I regret not just yelping for an Italian restaurant in Madison. The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned....I'll stick to yelping restaurants.",
        "I really wish this review could be great because my wife and I love other mellow mushrooms were we have dined and very happy to have one now uptown. However, the Uptown location doesn't quite seem to be ready for prime time business.  Lack of staff but plenty of seating.  Be prepared to wait.  I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food.",
        "We happened upon this on a sunday morning and were surprised to find the parking lot packed.  When we finished brunch we were left with not doubt why the lot was packed, DW is fantastic.  Great, latin influenced menu that has lots of options and flavor.  Service was great, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  They have a great reservation system that will text you when your table is ready, nice touch.",
        "Very disappointing. Chicken quesadilla was shredded and loaded with so much queso that it was soggy. Surprised because they have such a good rep but Im going to stick with Cabo Fish Taco.",
        "Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)",
        "If I could leave less of a star I would. Wasted so much time in lines. They were completely inaccurate in assumptions of line times. When told 45 minutes it was more like 2 hours. There were far more people coming out then they were taking in due to the incompetence on the computer. The manager at the buffet at ceasars needs to be fired for her attitude. Don't waste your money!",
        "Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.",
        "These people are amazing! I consider myself a difficult customer and they always go above and beyond. I always leave happy! They are especially helpful about scheduling they are so accommodating. This is my third time here and ingot Christmas nails. So cute! I always go to Mimi! Such a sweetheart.",
        "I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.",
        "Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there.",
        "I was recommended to go to Wright's by a friend of mine and I wanted to take the time to post a glowing review because the service was beyond my expectations. Tom and the rest of his staff are not only highly qualified, they are friendly, honest and very accommodating. If you are looking for a great mechanic, look no further!",
        "Why is this place so fantastic?\\nI don't even know. What a great addition to the scene.\\n\\nI am from Pittsburgh but now live in NYC and the bagel I had here this morning could rival a NYC bagel.\\n\\nSupport your local businesses, folks. This place is TOP NOTCH!!!!!!!!!",
        "Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \\\"how would X compare to X?\\\"  Answer: \\\"It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\\\"  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience.",
        "terrible service, food wasn't even decent, prices were average. I think the only type of ethnic food was the Mexican food. and pretty cool that they have their own name beer. was alright.\\n\\n\\nI wish I knew this place sucked so badly before even thinking of coming here.",
        "Chic, chic, chic!  I really like this place and any time I'm looking for a really fly top, Belle Ville is my first stop and they never disappoint.  Eye popping gear for that special event without the worry of someone else showing up with a duplicate:-). The sales associates are fashionista's and very helpful.  With so few shopping venues uptown, Belle Ville is a great find.",
        "My two year old loves coming to Jumpstreet and his older cousins have a blast too.  I find it a good value for the amount of fun the kids have.",
        "It is pretty good place to get boba. The snow ice is good and sweet. Only problem i have with this place  is that the service is not that great. I keep coming back because the boba is good.",
        "If you want more of an upscale feel of a casino then look no further! Make sure you bring plenty cash because the winnings over here are a lot less likely. I mean it's vegas and once you find your favorite place to gamble stick to it. It's one of those to each is own kind of situations but I rather not gamble here. Never had much luck but have friends who have!",
        "Hands down the best sushi I've ever had.  The other items are amazing too - kobe beef melts in your mouth.  Honestly one of the best meals in my entire life.  The ambiance is spectacular too, and the service is impeccable.  The waitstaff are friendly and full of good recommendations.  And it's at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Stick around and you might see Tommy Lee (I did).  ;)",
        "Sadly, I will have to take this location off my option list.  I will stick with the Sahara or Fashion Show location.  So convenient to my work place but after three days in less then a week of stopping by for some treats only to be greeted with a closed venue I am going to have to give up.  I'm just not down for making another wasted trip.",
        "We ate there twice with very good experiences. Food was delicious with very friendly and accommodating service. A refreshing perk.",
        "Nice, convenient location in uptown. I went in just to see what the deals were and what was in the pre-made entrees section of the store. There was a pretty good selection but nothing that really grabbed my attention so I walked out and went to a more appetite appeasing restaurant.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona! When we go out for spring training each year, its a must we stop when we arrive in AZ , and as we leave AZ! Gets pretty packed but they get people in quick. Love their omelettes and all dishes are huge portions and good service. They even sell their own hot sauce which is good too! Recommend Papa Burn sauce",
        "THIS PLACE WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN!!! Over priced flavorless Dim Sum( and I've had some shitty Dim Sum in my life) The portions were very pricey and minuscule. I could tell the server knew I didn't like my food and then she proceeded to avoid my table out of fear I guess. Either way don't go here unless you don't mind wasting time and taste buds.",
        "I really like this urgent care. The front desk staff is a little dry, but I've only had to sit in the waiting room for a few minutes each time. I love the doctors there, too. We have been there for strep tests, broken arms, and any other ailments we come across. I'm a repeat customer, and with a 2,3,4,7 and 9 year old, I can say that we will be back soon!",
        "Took forever to be seen by waitress. Not busy. Didn't ask me for anything to drink. Food was not bad but not good either. Got my order wrong. Nothing to write home about. I will not be coming back here.",
        "This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.",
        "The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.",
        "Inexpensive.... been coming here for years and the bartenders are great. When u sit on the patio u feel like you're at a ranch. Some douche does happen here.... close enough to the border Of the Land Of the Lames.... but still pretty safe. Parties and grilling happen here often. Day drinking is a given",
        "This place was amazing, best AYCE in town! The customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil Asian waitress working haha. The Sex Bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered!  Definitely coming back soon!",
        "All the used records here are basically beat up dollar bin records priced at $5 and up. Bad customer service too. Not coming back.",
        "The food was good but the service was not... This was only the second time to Englishes however, it was the last. Both times the same server inflated the bill by over $20 Does she really think we will keep coming back if she keeps overcharging. I don't see how they will be open much longer with the way they run this place. For now I will stay away!",
        "Consistent, eclectic fare at reasonable prices.   Large portions.   I eat mostly breakfast at ZJ's, have tried most of the menu over the years, and keep going back.   I've even figured out when to arrive so I can park!",
        "Disgusting Food !!!  Slow service !!! Waste of money.. I'm not coming back. All three dishes were bad, we left it almost untouched except French fries which was ok",
        "Just finished a wonderful dinner here!  Never had Turkish food before.  Will be coming back soon!  The Kuru Fasulye a white bean and chopped lamb dish was delightful.   The Lentil soup was velvety smooth and seasoned perfectly.   Turkish baklava is softer and chewier than most others, not overly sweet.  MUST have the Turkish coffee with it!   Awesome.   Staff was friendly and welcoming.   I highly recommend it.  Like a mini Mediterranean vaca!",
        "Best Stone Crab ever. \\n\\nWe went for a late dinner and had the stone crab bisque, which is just incredible, the onion strings and the 5 Large Stone Crab meal. And don't forget all the great bread. Our server was Stephen who was always available. \\n\\nWe are definitely coming back soon.",
        "This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).",
        "Awesome huge slices of New York style pizza.  Perfect amound of sauce and cheese on a chewy & crisp crust.  Pizza came out hot and fresh!  Staff was happy and accommodating.  Bing bang for your buck!",
        "The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.",
        "Dude something has happened to this place in recent months, the quality is not what it used to be, the service is not what it used to.  I don't know if they had a change in management or what cause me and my wife used to go here ALL the time for the All You Can Drink Saki and Beer and All You Can Eat.  We don't go here anymore cause the qualify just went and crapped out on us.  Go to Sushi Bomb down the street",
        "They do have a nice menu with tons of 'chocolaty' desserts, which are all amazing on your tongue, oh god! But I tend to prefer to grab a hot chocolate for take-out instead of drinking it on place: too crowdy for me.\\n\\nOtherwise, a nice place to discover tons of meals with chocolate in all forms! For the chocolate fans only ;)",
        "Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.",
        "I saw this show while I was in Vegas for Thanksgiving. Mom and I were looking for shows that were going on, and there weren't that many. But Legwarmers caught I am a big fan of the 80s, even though I was born in the 80's. I did think it was a bit cheesy at some parts, but it was enjoyable to a point. Don't think I'll be coming back soon though.",
        "The food was good ... the service at this location is HORRIBLE. They are slow never check in with your table and take forever to bring something once you ask for it. Never coming back to this location. Going back to the one on DI their service is amazing and the atmosphere is so much nicer."

        "Food is OK, but it has a distinct chain restaurant feel that you might expect from a Fox restaurant, which has about 50 location in Arizona and a few other Western states. The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but if you don't want to feel like you're at a Cheesecake Factory, I wouldn't recommend it.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Food is great, if you like waiting for 45 minutes for it. There were three of us and its not like we ordered anything complicated either. The server did aplolgize several times and offered us free dessert, which was also a waiting game as well. I love the food there but thats about where it ends.",
        "Saw a boxing match here.  No complaints.  The ticket prices are outrageous (which is fine- it's vegas) but this is just your typical 80s style arena- fold down seats, no cup holders, not that much space between rows.  I noticed that there were more people in the second tier seats then first tier- perhaps a testament to Vegas-style ticket sale practices.",
        "My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.",
        "First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.",

I have a rule, if it is not fresh seafood, don't get it.  The chicken dishes are great along with the jumbalaya.  About $40 for a good dinner.",

        "The food was ok but tricky advertising.\\nThe sign out side says in small letters salmon and then %50 off sushi in big letters.  You think everything is %50 off it's only order of salmon sushi.  Vary tricky advertising.  So we won't go back!",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.

        "I was not impressed. The cover was $30 for ladies and $40 for guys. Seriously? I don't have a problem paying cover, but $30 is excessive. I ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the Luxor instead.",

I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.",
        "I seriously love this place! I feel like 90% of my wardrobe is from here and whenever I get compliments I automatically send them here. The only thing I wish is that they would get in more smaller sizes when they order shipments because a lot of the time the smaller sizes are sold out. But other than that I love everything about this place!",
        "Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.",

Highly recommend this place!!!",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,",
        "I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!",
        "gosh, Charlotte must have low standards in sushi. This place was fairly terrible. Threw away 80% of my order. Salmon should have a taste and rice should be white, not 50 shades of gray.",

The San Diego tostada was still delicious, but I will begrudge them the krab I reluctantly consumed.",

I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",

OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",

        "Food was pretty good. The power company had an outage so during dinner it was about 90-95 degrees up there which made dinner pretty miserable. The manager said \\\"we can't control Nevada power.\\\" Creamed spinach was no good. Lobster   bisque was amazing as was the cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  The steak just ok.",
        "I would stay as far away from this place as possible. I bought a 2007 Cobalt from these rip off artists and it had 80K miles on it so it should have last more than four years. The car died this week and I had nothing but problems with it from the time I drove it off the lot.",

        "What a bad experience! We were just coming along for some nice after marathon Dinner when the wait was 40 minutes. Mike, the MANAGER, was rude and was turning people away left and right.

They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",

We will choose another company next time.",

Don't waste your money!",

        "They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??",
        "Thought we would try it as it just opened. Food was good if pricey for Mexican (3 tacos $12.95). Extremely noisy. You cannot have a conversation ..just eat and out the door. Don't think I would make a point of going back.",
        "The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",
        "Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! \\n. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's.",

But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for $4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce--the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm.",

We don't eat our food bland, in fact slightly on the salty side, but all the food here was just a bit too salty. It will definitely spike your blood pressure. The best part of this experience was the ambiance. Definitely chic and their bathroom is really different.",

        "This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it - share, the portion is HUUUUGEE.\\n\\nThis place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",

The service is just like any other Chinese restaurant- just ok. Parking can be a bitch sometimes, but what do you expect; it's right in the heart of Chinatown.",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",
        "Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)",

The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.",

I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",
        "The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back.",

The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \\\"automatic 2-putt\\\" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again.",
        "Went here over the holidays w/my parents, sister, and parents' friends.  This place is definitely a dive.  Good, relaxed atmosphere.

        "Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?

So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices.",

The Pho in Arizona is okay at best.  This place has a nice staff, the food comes out quickly, and the price is okay.  We eat here usually before going to Lee Lee's.  Not a bad place, just not great.",
        "They have some variety of stock that you may miss from India in Navratri Festival . I went there to collect Saindha Salt and Swang ke Chawal which I didn't find in other stores in Tempe , Arizona. The owner Mahesh Arora uncle is very good and courteous. \\n5 stars for good service and stuff I needed.",
        "I had the Hawaiian hot dog, small fry and small drink. My order came to $10 and some change. I was shocked when I was given the total for my order. It's crazy to be charged $10 for what I ordered. The fries were too salty. \\n\\nThe garbage can that I used was filthy. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks. Disgusting.",
        "I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.",
        "Very sad when this place burned down.  Loved their Hawaiian chicken. Looks like they were taken over by some new outfit.",
        "It's a nice place and pretty close to the the Jarry Metro\\n\\nNot too cramped for a Tuesday Night, very nice for having a group of people together.\\n\\nThe beer selection is very nice as well, having several Montrealer Microbrews. Had one of the stronger Ales (which tasted more like a Lambic than an Ale, but I digress) and it was a nice choice (though I'd describe it as slightly spicy)",
        "In my opinion, this is the best Portuguese bakery in Montreal. Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth! Obrigado!",
        "I highly recommend  this Bistro on amherst montreal, Its brand new the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I love  the ambiance and the owner is awesome.  They told me they will have a terrace for this summer :)  the great thing is they  change the table d'h\\u00f4te several times during the week so you don't get bored of the same menu. Finally great food with a great price .",
        "Might be a tough pizza critic since we're from Chicago.  Dough was very thin and therefore 'wet' when ingredients were added.  It was okay but I wouldn't be anxious to have it again.  \\n\\nSalad with shredded chicken, feta, tomatoes, and pine nuts was fantastic.  Served super cold with a light vinegar and oil based dressing.",

        "Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.",
        "Great little theater in montreal...not only do they show some pretty cool movies, but it's way cheaper than the standard theaters..\\n\\nalso, note the Metro grocery store right next door, great place to stock up before the movie :)",
        "Pretty good... Not as good as \\\"Wahoos\\\" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.",
        "The veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good.  Great wine selection as well.  If you find yourself in Montreal this will be a wonderful treat.",
        "Some stuff is cheaper. Other stuff is more expensive. I do like the deals at the deli. They have really good turkey and roast beef. They also give a 10% discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey. Love that they support the local team. Go cardinals!",
        "I really like this seafood buffet!! It's on the pricey side for $50 a person, but this is vegas!!!\\n\\nEverything on this buffet is good and fresh!! They put out big chunks of sashimi out!! Two different type of crabs and also baby lobster tails!!!\\n\\nThe roast beef and turkey breast is good and also a huge selection on desert!!!",
        "Totally can not talk crap about this place. There was no line today at all, food is very tasty and fresh, service is nice. Quite interesting experience if you have not been there and absolutely worth checking out.\\n\\nNot 5 starts for price and upkeep - i feel both cold be somewhat better.\\n\\n\\\"I like\\\"\\n\\nEugene",
        "This place is by far the best Chinese take out place that I gave eaten in. I lived in NY and been to California several times and this place is just as good or better!! You get a lot if food for little money!! They are quick with their deliveries or pick up order as well!! Keep up the good job guys!!!",
        "Love how close this place is to my house, love the Californian dreamin chicken sandwich! This place has a friendly staff and is kept clean. I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed!!",
        "Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.",
        "I ordered the $39.99 all you can eat meat; all of the meats were very dry!! The worst of the worst was the lamb, dry as hell and very gamey tasting. The worst lamb I've ever had. The acceptable items were the flank steak and the turkey wrapped in bacon, but not by much. \\n\\nDon't wast your time, money, or the opportunity to eat somewhere else.",
        "Great Place to Eat.. Native New Yorker and I thought I was home with Mom.. Puerto Rican and Cuban food very similar.. Highly Recommend. .",
        "Really nice Steakhouse. The food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly. We will come back as soon we are back in Montreal!",
        "Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.",
        "I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \\\"like a virgin\\\" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\\n\\nClassy.",
        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!",
        "One of the best pizza on in Montreal. \\nVery fresh and tasty ingredients.\\nDecor is interesting and staff is attentive.\\nVery nice experience overall.\\n\\nTips: Ask the staff which wine to get. It worked very well for us.",
        "I have enjoyed many sandwich shoppes   across Arizona over my 25 years hear, but this is one of the best. The freshness of the turkey and the vegetables on top of daily fresh baked bread is incredible.",
        "I am a fan of Culvers, but this location is not as awesome as the ones in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.  However, good service nonetheless, excellent burgers and mmm Culvers frozen custard.  It just can't be beat.",
        "The price tag for the Jimmy Dean Delights turkey sausage bagels said $5.99.  After I got home, I looked at the receipt and noticed I was charged $7.19.  Thanks for the false pricing, Target.  I think that's illegal, too.\\n\\nI'm going to think Twice before I go back to Target.  Might go ahead and close my Red Card too.  Not worth the 5% discount to get overcharged.",
        "$13.98 prime rib in the middle of the Strip.  Great deal when you consider a simple turkey sandwich could cost more than that across the street at the Bellagio or Caesars.  Nice menu, quick service.  Not very large, so I imagine there would be a wait at busy times.  I was there on a Monday night off season.",
        "Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available.",
        "A cool little walkway between the Flamingo and the Quad that has food, shopping places to sit and relax , and a few watering holes, not to mention a huge observation wheel that is soon to be open. I like this concept and it will be a great new place to take out of towers as well a a place to frequent as a local. I am excited to go to the Brooklyn Bowl. Bowling, drinks, food and concerts all at one venue. This place looks legit.",
        "One of Montreal's last great spots to catch independent films and an excellent way to support Montreal's documentary film industry.",
        "A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.",
        "10:30am - 2:30pm. The deli side is open!  They have the best sandwiches!  I recommend the ham and cheese on pretzel bread or the turkey and avocado.  As soon as you step in Eugene makes you feel welcome, is helpful and genuinely glad to serve you!",
        "Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.",
        "service is ok.\\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\\nchamomile tea is the best.\\n\\ngood luck.",
        "Great liitle mexican restaurant in the heart of old port Montreal.  Unique (this it has roasted eggplant in it)  spicey salsa, good guacamole, and frozen drinks.  We stayed at the hotel upstairs. Say hello to Fanny, she runs the place and adds a friendly touch to everything.",
        "Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.",
        "Pretty cool! I like trying new fitness places! My first time was great girls are amazing and Brooke taught a great class. 3 stars for making them you clean your equipment up after class. Maybe I'm a spoiled New Yorker but honestly you can't charge that kind of money and then make your clients wipe down their mats and stuff. Maybe Pittsburghers have time for that, I certainly don't.",
        "Was not impressed at all.\\nMy husband and I split the turkey burger and mac & cheese burger. \\nThe turkey burger was cold but otherwise tasty. The mac & cheese burger was not seasoned well and very bland. \\nService was horrible. Our waitress was in la-la land. She explained the menu but took forever to take our order and re-fill our waters. \\nWe will not return.",
        "I asked for delivery. Ok, they did it with no problems and quick enough (30-40 mins). \\nI chose just rolls. \\nThe salmon one was pretty flat, no taste. Californias were ok-ish.\\n\\nWhen I gave money to the woman who delivered she took them and left without saying a goodbye or thank you\\n\\nMeh",
        "I ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp. The bowl was small and barely had noodles. The breaded shrimp was dry, hard, and tasteless. This place was a waste of money and I left hungry. The food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at Hawaiian Flavor.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "The value here is outstanding.  They have the tastiest chicken and I'm really baffled by some of the reviewer's who didn't like it.  I lived in Charlotte the past three years and ate here frequently.   The squash casserole and buttered spinach are my favorite sides and the cornbread - YUM!",
        "Old hotel and casino, but it has a lot of nice qualities. The arena has hockey, and there is a bowling ally and arcade for kids.\\n\\nThe buffet is good, and reasonably priced. The gator bar has the cheapest drinks in Vegas I'm convinced! Ask for Spider!",
        "This outlet location is okay. I liked that they had mens, womens, and kids clothes. I went during winter and they had a good amount of sweaters and jackets. The prices were reasonable but the store was pretty disorganized. Not a bad place to shop if you already know what you're looking for.",
        "We were only in town for the weekend but happened to catch a food show about places in Montreal and on it they talked about the custom soft-serve ice cream flavours they produce. The next day we happened to be driving by, so stopped and got some cones. Very tasty! Friendly owners, cute set up! Would come back to try the next flavours.",
        "Seriously good sandwiches.  I had an A Wreck Sub with Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, and ham for five bucks you kidding me!  Added bacon for $1.25 and it was some of the best bacon I've ever had.  Definitely worth it.  Added all the veggies included their delicious hot peppers.  It's served warm and toasted and is super delicious.  \\n\\nReally go try it for yourself.",
        "Food was great!  We went back a few more times since November.  I'm very glad Al's fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again.",
        "One of the more inventive restaurants in Oakland, and yes, still affordable on a poor student- er, shoestring budget. The satay chicken was tasty and flavorful, and the noodle dishes are all fantastic. I got the pad thai, and it was very tasty; friends I went with got various curry/noodle dishes, and all were wonderful.",
        "Nothing special.  Went during winter, and while they still served frozen yogurt, I didn't get a chance to try it.  The rest of the foods were basic concession-stand items.  Burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, etc.  Would probably be nice for a visit in the summer, but not exactly a lunch destination.",
        "They need so much help with their security system in the Bowling Alley.  We had some things stolen.  ....they also need to get that Friday's out of there.  Baaaad service.  Baaad",

Bizarre. Those of us who are born too long ago have to pay to get in now. Be sure to check the site before going.. Recent change.",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.\\nWe will go back often!",
        "royal mile is beautiful, it's a lovely cobbled street that runs on a hill with pubs and shops and restaurants on either side. when it's empty it's great to walk down and when it's really busy during the festival with people advertising their plays it's even more awesome. i love it.",
        "The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.\\n\\nWhen returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers.

        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "FYI: Google/Yelp renders the location incorrectly, it's actually about a mile south of where it appears making this a difficult location to check-in at. It's in the shopping center just south of the 202 next to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. Bing maps this address correctly, Google will if you change the Address to Gilbert 85236.",

Defiantly will be going back.",

He was not attentive at all and was borderline rude to us the whole time we were there. The food was okay, but not excellent. The portions for the price are high even with this being Vegas. There are other places on the strip I would go to before ever go back to this place. Save your time and money!",
        "This place was amazing! I was very impressed, considering it was my first time, all my expectations were met. Our server was very kind when giving recommendations and patient when we had no idea what some of the stuff on the menu was. Our food came rather quickly, as we came right at the end of the rush.  We had the smoked salmon omelette and the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. Everything was so delicious. I will definitely be back again.",

        "This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order.",

Took a cab home at 3am, and no... they would not refund the room cost.",
        "Wow, what a complete ass the owner is. Walked in with a simple power board with some bad capacitors and he refused to even look at it. Went on a 5 minute tirade about the internet and amateurs and how he's sick of helping people and wasting his savings on this business. I just backed out of his cigarette-smelling store in disbelief. Stay FAR away from this nut.",
        "24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet.",
        "Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.",
        "This is a meatball joint. They sell beer and drinks. It is not fine dining. I think they do a great job and they aren't trying to be anything they aren't. I dig this place and I eat here frequently. I do not give out very many 5 star ratings. 4 stars is a really good score for me.",
        "Nothing special about this club, it has a dance floor, tables, bathroom, bar...pretty much all the essentials of a club. It's not that big, the music is okay...I've experienced better in Vegas. I do think the blue diamond bottle service is pretty cool and the elevator to the bathrooms is convinient. Overall, I had a good time but I can skip out on Bank next time.",
        "I go to this facility usually 3 nights per week at about 2am and love it. Its jot crowded at all, usually having about 3-5 people in it. I can have the basketball court to myself I wanted and move freely through workout stations.",
        "Horrible horrible service!!!! What happened to this place?\\nFood is good and fresh. I refuse to go here during normal hours but if I'm craving sushi at 2am then I'd stop by. Otherwise I will drive way across town to Yama Sushi for excellent service and food! So sad to see this place fall apart..",
        "This place is soooo Ghetto! The only reason I came here was because this Cigar lounge was inside this casino which ended up being a bust as well. This casino looks so dilapidated, dirty and dingy.",
        "Great lunch and amazing service.  Their smoked brisket sandwich was incredible.  Plus their patio is perfectly covered and comes with misters, which will make this a great place to stop by during the summer.",
        "OH. MY. GAHHHHHHHH.\\n\\nWhy blow $45 on a few rounds of poker when you can spend it on an entire day pass at Qua?!?  (Answer: you don't!)\\n\\nI can't say enough about this place...and I am way too lazy to write it all out. Just trust me, this place is AWESOMEEEEEE!!!",
        "Eric, owner of Tuning Gruppe is a VW/Audi enthusiast and truly cares about his customers and making sure they are happy.  Eric flashed my car with the GIAC DSG flash and the car has been running great!",
        "The jazz pianist is fantastic.\\n\\nOtherwise the food sucks & the place just creeps me out.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: Great piano music does not make a great restaurant",
        "Perfect shop for unique, witty, and humorous cards, gorgeous stationery, beautiful paper goods, and various novelties and gifts. I appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous. Parking can be a pain, but once you score a spot, you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store.",
        "Very nice place, great restaurant and bars!! I love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion!!! Better then cigarette smoke! The staff is nice and helpful!",
        "If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am.",
        "WOW this is by far the best selection of flavors and best tasting ice cream ever. I highly recommend this ice cream parlor, they have boba and are open til 2AM!",
        "The Broadway Series of musicals is fantastic! As I had been there before, I honestly thought there want a bad seat in the house. I was wrong. Left gallery was actually above the speakers, make the words to Evita almost inaudible. The production was great and I enjoyed the performance, but would highly recommend being no less than 2-3 floors up, if you can help it.",
        "For a man that's so popular on television, Gordon got it wrong. The asian dishes on the menu can't compete with China town. The burgers were ehh. I am reviewing this place based on worth and price. It's not worth eating here and spending so much money for the 'experience'. Go down to the linq and find you Fuku burger. Just sayin.",
        "I've been here twice now and the first time was great service and the Mac & cheese was delicious!!! However, today was ridic. I called at 5:54 to see if they had hh and I was told \\\"yes! Until 7\\\". We arrived 10 min later and then I was told \\\"no we don't have hh today\\\". This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars.",
        "The air conditioning in room 1602 didn't work, and the hotel refused to take responsibility. They simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before- we didn't get in until 2am- i would not stay here again. Ridiculous customer service.",
        "If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune.",
        "I am from Vancouver BC, never been to Dunn's before showing up here on a cold snowy night.\\n\\nI was really impressed with the smoked meat. Now I need to go visit the one we have on Seymour St. I didn't know we had.",
        "Spent a pleasant couple of hours smoking a fine cigar and reading a table book about what else, cigars. Hospitable owners, offered expresso to go with our smoke. \\n\\nDefinitely wish they have places like this shop back home! Bought a few more cigars to go. Nice way to spend an afternoon in Vegas.",
        "I went to this bar while visiting family at Christmas time. While there the owner screamed obscenities at a young woman and told her to leave, apparently all because she and her friend were having a disagreement with an off duty bar tender.  The owner was also a slob and dressed in sweats and sneakers.  Completely unprofessional event to witness, and I would never go to this bar again.",
        "OK, we have been to Soul Cafe many times and have found it to be pretty good.  This last time, not so much.  Loved the ham on rye every other time I've had it here, but this time the bread was really stale.  After eating almost half the sandwich, I asked my waitress to please put the remaining ingredients on a piece of FRESH bread.  Guess what - it came back with stale bread again!  Most likely will not go back.",
        "Pretty good for 3AM pizza. Knocked off a star because the slices were sweating off oils... (probably because we ordered all of the meats). Crust is on the thin side. Would come back when craving pizza in Vegas!",
        "Brings me lots luck here, specially the 777 slot machines...  :-)",
        "I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again.",
        "If you get lucky to snag on of the 4 or 5 tables out on the balcony overlooking Freemont Street you have scored.  $3.25 for a cocktail.  Great place to rest your weary feet for awhile.",
        "While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!",
        "There's nothing quite like dancing on the deck 52 stories above the strip with the summer wind blowing your hair around. It makes anyone feel like a hip hop video vixen. Yes boys, even you.",
        "Good place to watch a game.  You need to make a reservation. Most tables have there own television, but there are tv clusters. It's nice to watch a game in the outdoor area by the strip. I thought the food was good. It's good bar food.",
        "Small, easy to navigate, a good middle-class hotel. Stayed in the \\\"Playboy Tower\\\" which was nice. Within walking distance to the Gold Coast and Rio, but not much else. Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM.",
        "Writing about the poker table. The dealers here are rude and sometimes split the pot wrong. For example, it was heads-up and me and the other guy had ace king. When the pot was split, he got an extra $5 chip and I got a white $1 chip. When I corrected him, he said the next hand was dealt. Little ass.",
        "I had my hair cut by Mariana and she did a great job.  I have extremely fine hair and she did her best to give it some life.  She listened to me talk about what I was trying to achieve longer than any stylist ever has.  She also gave me some good tips as she was styling.  She was very nice, talkative and happy so it made for a good experience.  Plus it didn't break the bank.  I already booked my next appointment!",
        "Sold me an Air Filter for $38.54. I said it's too expensive. Answer: It is a great price, filters are so expensive. I'm look today in the Internet. $10.36. It's a scam!!!",
        "This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub. If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you. Unfortunately for me I like to sleep. I will never stay here again.",
        "I went for a late lunch - only one other table there.  The rye bread was stale, lean corned beef very dry, fries OK and service very indifferent.  I went out of my way to eat here but will never go back.\\n\\n I had just been in a deli in the Chicago area....now that was a GREAT CB sandwich and service was very pleasant.  Wish they had a Benny and Max's here in Charlotte.",
        "Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.",
        "We haven seen a number of shows in both Reynolds Hall and more intimate Cabaret Jazz.  The buildings and grounds are beautiful and represent a cultural gem for the city  and its residents.  We invariably see at least one show each trip and have never been disappointed.  On our most recent visit we saw the Wizard of Song which previously played off Broadway for 1.5 years and starred local George Bugati.",
        "I've been here only a few times and the staff was really rude all of the times. Today they crossed the line when they refused to refill my drink with the rewards program. They did not offer to make it right and handled the situation very unprofessionally.\\n\\nIf you are in the area, make sure to go to the Starbucks in Rock Hill, just down the I-77 instead of this hole.",
        "Home away from home. Great selection of Cigars, wrist watches and shaving products. Great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens. No membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge. Highly recommend Cigar King.",
        "Short wait.  Television available in news or sport channel. Bring reading material or tablet to pass the time. Mammography technicians were good. Office personnel really nice but a little disorganized. They really try to accommodate patients in.",
        "The cocktail waitresses are always awesome.  Food is really good in the Cafe (great hamburgers).  Service in Cafe is sometimes hit or miss, but the hostess/cashiers are always friendly and helpful. The cashiers and wait staff in the buffet also do a great job and are always friendly.  Gambling is, of course, hit or miss (like any casino).  I like this local place.",
        "Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure.",
        "Stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and as a top tier member, I was still given a low floor that faced that (now learned) noisy side right toward the street. I was up all night with loud noises going on at least until 2am. Very hard to sleep. Room overall was decent but the noise will keep me from coming back here in the future unfortunately.",
        "Cafe Monte is an excellent brunch spot for those with discriminating taste buds and small appetites.  I arrived with excitement and left hungry.  I know they are going for a \\\"French\\\" feel...but it just isn't my place of choice.  I will say our waiter was  GORGEOUS  and the piano man kept me entertained...a no go in the future.",
        "saw another movie & this time in the cinema suites theatre.  Wonderful experience.  the chairs recline to almost lie down & you get a free cup of chocolate covered popcorn & a wetnap.  I felt like I was flying first class :)\\nagain, I have to mention the sound system- it is really impressive.  Not so impressive was the \\\"limited time only\\\" calamari appetizer - I had to send it back.",
        "Not really on the strip, that's too bad because it's pretty nice.\\n\\nI would say it's less classy/luxurious but very urban, rocker like. My friend told me about this great steak and eggs cafe they have for only $7.77, gotta check it out next time.",
        "Holy SMOKE, this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy.  It made the dining less enjoyable.  We went for the famous \\\"Steak Special\\\". And I must say it was pretty darn good.  The green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well.",
        "New place just opened tonight stopped in and it was awesome\\nAs usual 7712 Sassaman lane  off Britten smith blvd grand opening. Having basil noodle. The best Thai food around",
        "Warning!!! Watch your bank account after transactions. We through the drive thru at approx 350am. Ordered a breakfast burrito and the night shift guy over weight build wearing black rimmed glasses gave himself a $10 tip. Service was slow and he stated he was on the phone with the police. Best conversation I heard with the police. Beware!",
        "The show was the standard onion volcano and spinning eggs. The food was nothing special as it went from bland to weirdly seasoned back to bland. \\nAwesome wait staff helped the score but the price and overall food experience means I most likely return.",
        "I love this place! I've eaten here many times and the food and service is excellent. Try the smoked pork belly salad - It is decadent! Great wine selection also.. Bravo !",
        "The Gyro Wrap is quite tasty along with the salad and affordable for under $10. There is just enough food for my husband and I to share although I must say he hogs the wrap... The staff is very friendly as well. A good place to try for a good mix of decently priced and good tasting Greek foods. On the weekends they have the classic \\\"old Greek looking guy\\\" playing some tunes on his piano for your enjoyment as well.",

        "I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests.",
        "No star would be better, horrible customer service in the \\\"SERVICE\\\" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are \\\"man\\\" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!",
        "Food is great, if you like waiting for 45 minutes for it. There were three of us and its not like we ordered anything complicated either. The server did aplolgize several times and offered us free dessert, which was also a waiting game as well. I love the food there but thats about where it ends.",
        "I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \\nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \\nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",
        "I just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me. The girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site. There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't want my business.",
        "On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there..",
        "This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it - share, the portion is HUUUUGEE.\\n\\nThis place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",
        "This is located conveniently next to the hard rock hotel. When they say everything is bigger in Vegas, they aren't kidding. This cvs was huge and had everything you could possibly need. The pharmacist was very helpful - I have a cold on my vacation :( \\nThe employees were very nice, but I feel like for the volume of people they had, they should've had more registers open.",
        "If you want a pizza that's ready to pick up quickly this is not the place. Last 2 visits all I wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times I was told a 15-20 minute wait. Hot and ready?????? Obviously not. Staff isn't the nicest either",
        "I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.",

        "We recently dined there while visiting family in Scotland.  The food was very mediocre.  I ordered the salmon. I took a couple of bites and knew it was NOT fresh. I called the waitress and told her.  She said she would tell the chef. They did not offer to replace the dish and charged us for it. I became very ill in the night from the spoiled fish. Not only was the food bad but the service and management was worse.  We would never go there again!",
        "If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.",

HA! the Ceviche was so good! with the sweet potato warm just like they serve it in Peru.  I also had the pescado sudado ... VERY GOOD! the owner was super nice and I will stop here every time I go to Vegas! DELICIOUS!",
        "Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint , clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. \\n\\nOh well, onto the next burger joint.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.

Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.",

Tonight was no different.  They catered to a large party and told us they purposely out to go orders behind them...I've been a regular since they've opened.  For better service go to Tomo...WAY BETTER SERVICE!!!!",

        "Amazing. I would have never guessed this place would be this nice and decadent inside Aliante Casino. To start the bread alone was amazing. We ordered the special, Australian lobster tail and Filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just walking in I was taken back by the decor and friendly and professional demeanor of the staff. Dinner for two with 1 alcoholic drink was $145. Id go back all the time if I could afford to. Live music was a plus.",
        "Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.",
        "I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.",
        "I ordered the Chicken Fajitas which were average.  The food is nothing special and the service is very slow.",

I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. \\n\\nThe second time they charged my food and someone else's. Even though I told her what I had. \\n\\nIt might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.",
        "A little over-priced... but so is everything in ARIA. It is what it is on that front. I will go back for the food, the service and the drinks.

I will be back Lemongrass!",

An espoused Chicago restaurant and no Blackhawks game only Ozzie and Harriet come on now.....Cave Creek is starving for any dining experience ...Time will tell....",
        "We finally tried this place and I must say I was mostly disappointed. We ordered a sandwich, a burger and two smoothies for $30. I would pay $30 for lunch, but not here. The burger was bland and prepared well done when I had requested medium. On the positive side, the smoothies were outstanding. They tasted like fresh fruit. \\nI would go back for the smoothies and to try the baked items, but definitely not for a meal.",
        "Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",
        "I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.",
        "Total crap food\\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!",
        "Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",
        "The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice.",
        "Never again! This place is gross. Dirty stained sheets, windows that don't open, bathrooms with no locks! \\n\\nStayed here for 4 days.. housekeeping NEVER ONCE CAME. Why don't you care?! :(\\n\\n\\nOh, they give AAA discounts but you need to tell them before you book..",
        "We've ordered from Slide and Bounce Around a couple of times... We love what they offer and had a Blast every time!!",
        "The food is your standard, crappy Chili's food. However, as far as airport Chili's (and even regular Chili's) go, the staff here was the nicest and most efficient I've ever encountered. (Note: No alcohol is served anywhere in the Char airport before noon on Sundays.)",
        "I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,",
        "Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE.",
        "This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",
        "Ate there last week, kind of high priced for the fare we ordered. I had the petite steak, they were right. Did not mind the small steak, but the sides were small & not creative, should have a potato, steamed veggies, or brown rice, for this dish.",
        "I love the Beef Pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw. I will be back once it's under 100\\u00b0 again - because seriously, soup in the summer just sucks.",
        "My boyfriend made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The view was amazing (at night)  and the food was delicious. We both ordered the surf and turf my lobster was so good and my steak so tender and moist . My boyfriend who usually doesn't like his steaks medium rare ended up finishing my plate!  he said and I quote \\\" best steak hes ever had\\\" we came at night and the vibe was romantic.",
        "The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)",
        "DONT EVER GO TO THE SPA GUYS! As I was leaving I was approached by 2 security guards accusing me from two other guests that I was acting aggressively. I was upset and also uncomfortable. In the end I then proceeded to tell the security guards this is the last time I will come here. I told them that I felt very uncomfortable over accusations that were not true. DON'T EVER GO TO THE SPA AT LEXWORD MEN YOU MAY GET STOPPED BY SECURITY AND BE ACCUSED!",
        "Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.",
        "Worse Home Depot lazy waited 30 minutes to get help in electrical department. The CUSTOMER SERVICE person told me\\\" I paged the person what else can he do! \\\"\\n\\nGo to Val Vista store",
        "Went here today for the first time and ordered the Bloody Mary + the wilted spinach salad with salmon. \\n\\nThe Bloody Mary was pretty exciting with pickled green beans, salami, lime and stuffed olives (these were my selections there are many more options). \\n\\nThe salmon was prepared medium well which was perfectly executed. Great place with good service!",
        "Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito. Food was plain and overpriced for what you get.",
        "A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.",
        "This used to be a drive up coffee shop. Now the serve great food and the best damn lemon drop martinis that they serve in huge glasses. Staff is very friendly. Wish I wasn't moving to Scottsdale, will probably not make it back here.",
        "I love this place! They have great gas prices and friendly staff. The lines are long but they go quick. The baggers are extremely helpful and always go above and beyond.",
        "Negative. Food was totally bland until i ate a retadro pepper that burned my tongue so i couldn't tell it was tasteless. Decent delivery time but yea, no.",
        "Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.\\nMy Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.\\nFriendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.\\nExtra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!",
        "This could be the best restaurant in Charlotte. I have been three times now and each experience is unbelievable. The pasta dishes are all perfect and each should be ordered to share. The falafel is some of the best I have ever had. The steam bun is such a pleasant surprise. Each dish is so well thought out and the service is always great. Though I can't eat shellfish I've always been told that the scallops are to die for.",
        "This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price.",
        "We had Andy as our waiter and he was great! Super helpful with my vegan options, made our night super fun and special. All the staff was very nice and food was just awesome. VEGAN options were fantastic! Drunken noodles was superb, vegan brownie sundae just lovely. Thanks Wazuzu and Steve Wynn for being vegan friendly!",
        "We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "People there always helpful and friendly. Reasonably priced wine",
        "I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",
        "I just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here. Both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time. I took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong. You would think Dunkin Donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves.",
        "this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one.",
        "Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \\nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.",
        "I recently got into doing triathlons. Finding a good tri store I thought would be hard, but the staff at tribe has been helpful every time I come in. They are loaded with all the workout goodies, which I love... Though my wallet may not.\\nIf you are looking for any gear for swim, bike, or run this is a good spot!",
        "Loved it! Ordered my virgin daiquiri in a mini-blender (I'm pregnant) and was a happy girl! Bartender was very friendly and made sure that no one took my seat since I was pregnant and couldn't stand long. Will definitley go back!",
        "Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \\\"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\\\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real.",
        "The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.",
        "The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome.",
        "I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!",
        "I don't even like giving one star. Really wished I'd checked here first.  As stated in the other reviews, I haven't been able to get an apt., or talk to a real live person, only told to send an e-mail.  The address is still listed incorrectly.  I would say there is \\\"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE\\\"  at all.  How do you run a business  like this and expect return customs",
        "The variety is great, but I think they if they served the princess cupcake every day they would get so much more business! Cupcakes are top heavy which is fine because the icing taste way better than the cake itself. I found the cake portion of the cupcake to be mediocre but the icing is totally worth it! The best flavors are Miss Princess, Wedding Cake, & Birthday cake. I do feel the prices are too high.",
        "I like the fish tacos and have ordered them several times before. But today I stopped by to place an order and was completely ignored. The person at the front desk just kept speaking Spanish to someone who worked there and never made eye contact. I left without ordering.",
        "Had a lot of fun dousing a few super-delicious strawberries and cream puffs at the chocolate fountain during the Yelp Rocks event Thursday night... I could've swam in that chocolate fountain bobbing for cream puffs all night, I tell ya!  \\n\\nHere's hoping S'Bistro will be present at the next rock-some party Gabi organizes!",
        "Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil (huh???).  After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",
        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good."
