        "Very professional company when it comes to dog services.  Brock and Verg offer services and products only available through a caring small business.  Hazel is a large Weimaraner Chocolate Lab mix and demands attention constantly.  Desert Dog Pet Care provides both food and comforting attention to Hazel.  Thanks Desert Dog Pet Care you ROCK!!!!!!!",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \\n\\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. \\n\\nThe pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. \\n\\nThe one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.",
        "This place is $5 for adults $2 for kids, and everything there is to do costs even more money. The website doesnt say any of this. I'm very aggravated that i spent $11 to get me and my kids in here and still cant do anything without paying at least $3 more PER KID. I feel rather ripped off. I wont be back.",
        "Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.",
        "Organized a business breakfast here and was impressed by how attentive and efficient the service was. We were seated at a great table facing the windows. I really liked the little chair they offered for purses, too cute.\\n\\nI had the duck hash & eggs which was delicious, although the pancakes looked great too. Tableau is perfectly classy and elegant, yet casual at the same time.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Nothing.\\n\\nLIKE  The spinach curry. The chicken cutlet. The sides offered. The pleasant service. The close proximity to other local favorite spots.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower.",
        "James beard nominated chef, gourmet magazine says best Thai restaurant in north America, wine spectator award...All True and more.  Anyone who rated this place less than 4 stars needs to go back to panda express where you belong.  Incredible food, amazing wine list that's has some bottles of wine below retail.  Nothing else compares!!",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "Dr. Nathan Blanton was the reason I used to go to this location of Mountain West Chiropractic. Since Dr. Blanton is no longer practicing at this office, I stopped receiving treatment here.  I have now have no idea of the quality of treatment this office now provides.",
        "Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \\n\\nNo happy hour menu. \\n\\n\\\"Communal bar table\\\" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\\n\\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return.",
        "Phoenix House Painting just completed a complete exterior repaint of my home and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend them.  The owner, John Morris, is a veteran of the paint industry.  The guys that work for him are smart, efficient, careful and quick. My home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials. Stop by and take a look.  They are the best !!!",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",
        "The location is perfect. It's in downtown Phoenix and connected to Z Pizza! They offer a variety of items to choose from: breakfast food, ice cream, baked delicacies, etc.\\n\\nThe downside is that it's dark in there. It feels kind of depressing. There is not very much parking.",
        "This place is ghetto assf#*k! There are methers, prostitutes and scum that frequent this place, they do offer a AAA discount that brings the total to around $50 after tax. If you need a place to stay this will do, just don't leave your valuables in your vehicle.\\n\\nGood luck",
        "Safeway's are great now..  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good, fresh sushi, good sandwiches and wonderful soups... since i work in the area i eat lunch there alot and am happy with the price and selection...",
        "The room or pretty decent, but their WiFi policy is INSANE.  $25/day PER device.  I sucked it up and paid for my work laptop, and then determined it was $25 more for my iPad and $25 more for iPhone.  Absolutely ridiculous.",
        "You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!",
        "I've gotten several very nice pedicures at DV.  The place isn't fancy but it's clean, the staff is friendly, and they offer good prices.",
        "Service sucks sooooooo bad. I waited 25 minutes for a bowl of chili? Really? Did they have to hunt a cow? I mean you scoop it in a bowl and you serve it. It should only take 5 minutes but 25 minutes???? I walked out. Oh and by the way I told my waitress I've been waiting for 25 minutes---- she said ok. No apologies. Wow! Avoid it like a plague.",
        "They offer a good variety of food and most of it is OK but nothing is really good. The best thing I had there was the Wonton Soup and it was not the best I've had by a mile. I did go for lunch so maybe the dinner buffet is better but I would avoid it as the Chinese Restaurant is much, much better than this and with less people.",
        "Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone. When we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn't offer any solutions.",
        "Great espresso drinks crafted expertly! I haven't met the whole staff but, the redhead with the glasses provides awesome customer service. She's really friendly, not something you can expect from every coffee house (see: the 90's), and makes some damn tasty beverages. Nice decor, but I'm partial to sci-fi. I'd definitely return as long as awesome people like her work there!",
        "I really like this place !!! The taste is good but I like people there. The servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and don't bother you with over kindness. And their boba tea is the best in town !!!!",
        "Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person.",
        "I enjoyed a nice manicotti dinner here tonight. We had a group of 12 and I believe everyone enjoyed dinner. Some nice specials were offered. Prices were reasonable.",
        "Friendly staff, great food/coffee and well priced. When our bagels took a little longer than expected we were offered 2 more drinks on the house (generous and unexpected!) - the flat white is top quality.\\n\\nEverything looks like it'd be just as good. Quick tip, 'would you like side salad' means extra salad on top of what is served with the food - it'd be cool if they made this a bit more clear!",
        "We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER.",
        "Great place to stay. Rooms are spacious and clean. The price is fair. It's at the end of the strip so there's less foot traffic which is a blessing. The air is cleaner vs other hotels. Lots of things to do in the hotel: beach, mall, bars, clubs, spa, many others.",
        "Food is ok but for the love of Pete lose the  iPad check pay system! We want paper checks!!!  After having lunch with friends we were shown our individual bills on an iPad and asked to finger sign. Lunch with one entree and no drink was over $22 each with tax and tip. Really?  No detail of our bills and no paper receipts. Bad!!!",
        "Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying.",
        "if you're looking for customer service do not go to Bacchanal Buffet!  We hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 10:01 only to be turned away.  Absolutely no compassion!",
        "When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there.",
        "Worst service. \\nThe host was to personal. \\nMy silverware was dirty and had food on it.\\nDon't think this place is safe to eat.\\nThe waitress was not friendly and didn't explain the specials they offer. The waitress took 8 minutes for our drinks and they weren't even busy. The food came out warm not hot. She took a 30 minutes to bring the food. I think all their locations have gone down hill.",
        "This is one of my favorite used book stores in Charlotte.  The staff is always super helpful, prices are great, and the selection is wonderful.  I have bought everything from Tom Clancy books to a cookbook by Gordon Ramsay, and everything in between.  Recently, they also offered a groupon, $40 worth of material for $20.  If you are looking for a great deal, stop in.",
        "The crowd was all old creepy drunk men , one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had, and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iPhone!!!! music was so loud I couldn't think.. bartender was awesome though.",
        "No longer my favorite as they limit their wifi on weekends! The two stars are for the wifi, not for the coffee. While everything else stays the same, their service for providing a cozy study spot is no longer excellent! Two stars for the wifi, as they still provides wifi started at 2 PM.",
        "Poor customer service, especially on the phone. I know it's Home Depot, but the least you could do is introduce yourself when you pick up a phone call instead of just saying, \\\"hullo.\\\" And don't respond with \\\"yeah, of course!\\\" when we ask you if it's Home Depot because you didn't tell us where we were calling in the first place.",
        "Complaint not properly addressed!!!\\nI had a full leg wax and got burned. The technique was immature and when I called the salon to complain they offered me products to buy. That's ridiculous way of doing business. I went to the Scottsdale location and will NEVER be going back. Stay away from that place.",
        "Awesome experience. Price point was great. They offered a free checked bag and wine and a snack on the flight. Who could ask for anything more.",
        "I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.",
        "I have been to the new location in Surprise twice now. Most of these places are all the same - I was greeted as I came in and offered a sample cup. The bananalicious or whatever it's called is really, really good! My kids love going here for a sweet treat after swimming lessons. The employees are great, the place is clean and the yogurt is yummy.",
        "Went in to get a dress for my young daughter. Was ignored from start to finish. When I asked if they could see if another store had the dress I wanted, instead of offering to call, they offered to give me the number so I could call. Terrible customer service. I bought my wedding dress here 10 years ago. Will never go back.",
        "The atmosphere was great! The menu didn't have as many options as I would have liked. In Southern California Brunch is usually offered Sunday with bottomless mimosa's or champagne, omelette station and buffet style, but Chelsea's Kitchen is a brunch menu style restaurant strictly menu and on Saturday's they offer bottomless Mimosa's. I will have to try it again.",
        "Found a great dress, but when I was trying it on, the fitting room attendant opened the door on me (without knocking) and I had to slam it shut. Mind you, it was the same attendant who let me in that room less than 5 minutes before. No apology, nothing. They definitely need customer service training here.",
        "The Sales clerks at the gun counter are very rude and act as though you are a nuisance if you ask a question. I have had several interactions with different clerks and the culture they have developed in my observation is one that they dont need customers, customers need them.  I really enjoy sportsmans and the products they offer. I sincerely hope that things get better with their staff.",
        "Not a fan.  Pretty sure I was waiting for a food poisoning experience.  It was clean, I will acknowledge that.  But I am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered.  It seemed gross and chewy.\\n\\nNo flavor after adding 10 ladles of sauces.  It was a miracle we survived, since we only went based on our GPS and not reviews.\\n\\nLesson learned......read Yelp!",
        "this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.",
        "Went to One Love Boutique through a Living Social special.  They offered a dermaplane and facial treatment for an unbelievable price.  I can honestly say that Lori P. did the best job out of all the facials I have had.  Such a relaxing atmosphere. She never tried to sell me on products. I have spent double the price and more at other facilities and none compared to my experience with Lori.  She gained a new client!!",
        "Terribly maintained. The greens are worn and ripped all over the place. Nice layout, but I just had to shake my head at how poorly maintained this place was. It was as if management never took a look. Just awful.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "A farewell lunch for a coworker landed me here.  I wasn't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal, it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do.  Thankfully, my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than I expected, with lots of fries on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus.",
        "Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards...",
        "Second time in a row these people botched my order. I ordered mushrooms, I got onions, which I am allergic to :( And all I got offered was dessert. Should've been a full refund of my $$. NOT nice. They did send me a second order, which was correct, and both delivery guys were quick and very nice. But still, twice in a row? Really?",
        "Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix.",
        "So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!",
        "This place is awesome. Great tacos, super reasonable, and nice adult beverage selection. They have several craft beers, which is a nice touch for my main squeeze. The cod tacos are super yummy.. They have great happy hr deals too. Only crappy thing is that it's only offered Monday-Thursday. But, great little patio.. And every time I have been, the service was very laid back and friendly.",
        "Never really read books but went to get magazine before.",
        "Good little neighborhood joint.  The food is good, the pours are reasonable, and the bar top is one awesome hunk of wood.  The decor is that of a golf nut, as the owner a Scots expat.  They've got a loyalty card of sorts and offer specials regularly.",
        "This place is average at best.  The ambience is good for watching games and as a social Hang.  Their prices are too expensive for anything I ordered.  Below average food, under poured drinks.  When your a vegas local in hospitality you don't wan to feel like your getting ripped off for drinks and cheap food.",
        "After getting ripped off by Leslies Pool for Pool supplies and repairs, I now go miles out of my way to shop at B & B for all my Pool needs.  They are HONEST and reasonably priced. All of their technicians are knowledgeable in Pool maintenance and  repair.",
        "All the wine (by glass) taste the same because they've been sitting out for days. I am not much for chocolate or sweets so I'll save a star for those who do. They do offer some of the best Spanish wines by the bottle, however, and may be worth a trip to grab some rare vintage. So skip the food, skip the wine and ask what's new from Spain / Portugal (unless you really enjoy a warm glass of vinegar.)",
        "I just tried their Tomato soup & it was really good! But what I really liked was the FREE Stuff....Get a FREE Bagel w/ CC, Join EBB VIP Text Club!

        "Since the last post my diet has changed dramatically. I had to learn how to find the right places to eat and Acacia was one that I now frequent because they are super flexible and when I told them what I couldn't eat they offered up alternatives.  THAT WAS AWESOME!  Sometimes it doesn't seem like the lady at the front register isn't so friendly but once you get to know her you realize she does care. It's quickly becoming one of my fav's.",
        "I went to Buffet at Asia on at 3:30pm dinner realize that dinner starts at 4:00pm, I only paid for lunch, the waitresses come to my table at least 8 times to see if I was eating any crab legs, however never offered me a refill on my drink...Poor service.",
        "Decent price. \\nLarge portions. \\nFree refills. \\nGood taste.\\nNice variety. \\nOn the casino floor so don't have to go far to play after you eat. They offer to-go as well so that's cool! We will eat here again. We got in late tonight after long day at Grand Canyon and driving so was tired. This place was quick and easy so worked out.",
        "Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly",
        "I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great.",
        "Their menu is overwhelming with all of the choices. They jave just about everything a restaurant could offer. You won't leave this place hungry because their portions are huge. You can easily split a meal between two people.\\n\\nI am a fan of having breakfast or lunch here. I have never had dinner.\\n\\nGreat bagels and bread!",
        "This walmart never seems to have anything. When I go to other walmarts I am surprised by all the things they offer. It is very clean and friendly staff.",
        "Very delicious and fresh food! I love the various menu items and what they have to offer. We came here for dinner with a friend from out of town, and everyone at our table was more than satisfied! I love how this place supports local produce and farms. Yum!",
        "Been there many times and have not been disappointed by the BBQ. Only been open for a short time but has won many awards and \\\"best of\\\" contests. Travel Channel has already spotlighted them! Be prepared to wait in line. The quickest I have made it through getting my food is about 40 minutes. Despite the wait, it is still a 5 star join.",
        "Yummy!!  Offered to let us take some peanuts to go.\\n\\nThe soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations.  One of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine.",
        "Excellent food and service.  Only mistake chef made was there was a piece of plastic paper slipped into the coffe from the kitchen.  Manager apologized and gave us free dessert. However, it was pretty dangerous that we almost drank in that plastic paper..",
        "Horrible customer service. I understand the workers are helping customers out, but none greeted or asked if I needed help. I stood there for a good twenty minutes before leaving.  I am an iPhone user but this makes me want to leave the brand. I had some questions that websites don't have a clear answer to.",
        "It is alright. My buffalo chicken pizza was tangy but not spicy, but still pretty good. The beer selection is pretty great. The service was pretty terrible but the manager came out and apologized for the shabby service and comped my pizza so kudo's for that. I felt the atmosphere was cold and uncomfortable and the design was definitely done by some company who shouldn't be designing restaurants. Ill go back and give it another shot before i write this one off.",
        "Love what Smart Security has to offer! Josh is very knowledgeable, and I'm sure he can answer any security question that you can throw at him. Give him a call & check out the smart phone apps!",
        "If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant.",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious. \\n\\nThey don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!",
        "Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends.",
        "Thanks dude with the glasses. You were tacking in charges without explaining anything. Oh and usps does give you a tracking number bro. 70 cents. Thanks a lot for not offering all of your services. I would've left zero stars if I could have. The dude at the cash register was so rude and uninformative.",
        "Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!",
        "Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs, raw oysters, greens, and fish... they also have clams, mussels, crawfish... the kids love this place.  We always print out the 10% off coupon online.  For all the seafood thats offered, it's better than your average chinese/asian buffets around town...",
        "I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!",
        "The customer service here is amazing. I've never been treated so well. Tony takes the time to introduce himself and learns your name. He says goodbye to everyone that leaves and says their name. He gives you a side of garlic knots on the house (the sauce is incredible). I haven't even had the food yet and I already know I am coming back. This is how a business should be ran."

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the full tasting menu with one wine pairing.\\n\\nThe dishes were very original and the presentation of each dish was extraordinary!\\n\\nEverything was beyond our expectation!\\n\\nBravo!",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "Freed's Bakery made ordering a custom cake a breeze! It was a week before my friends and I would be going to vegas to celebrate a birthday. They made a delicious red velvet cake and delivered it to the restaurant w/ no hiccups!\\n\\nWe ordered a red velvet cake w/ irish bailey filling and butter cream frosting. The cake was so moist, the girls and I devoured it.\\n\\nthanks for everything!",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.",
        "Stay away from  their clearance sales!!!  We stopped at the Carefree location, which was having a clearance sale.  Sadly, we spent over $50 on what turned out to be vinegar.  There's no way I can possibly go through 6 bottles of red wine vinegar.  What a waste of my time, money, and wine.  I didn't even get what I paid for.",
        "This is the BEST breakfast in all of Pittsburgh.  Service is always good.  Seating is limited but it's worth the wait if you find a line.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "No longer serving food :/ and not a huge selection of smoothies...\\n\\nStill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a VegasHot! class.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\\nWe both got sick after.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "Never having has gellato before, this was definitely a lot easier on the wallet and feet than going over to the ice creamery on The Strip. Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "heeelllooooo chocolate chili milkshake!\\n\\ndulishus.",
        "Usually when I expect something to be amazing it sucks. This place was actually as good as I thought it would be. I ordered the famous chicken and waffles :) good stuff...between my sis and I we barely finished it. The place is good.. def worth a try and I def would go again when I'm in Vegas.",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review! Durango/215.",
        "I love the eclectic atmosphere. ..I also love the assortment of desserts!! The lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast. My favorite sweet is the Salted Caramel Brownie. .soooooo yummy!!!!",
        "Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here.  While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there.  Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in...",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",
        "Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",
        "Waited 10 minutes in DT for 3 sandwiches that were cold when I got them, the Mexican in the window only told me to have a good day when I asked what took 10 minutes for me to get my food... 3 other cars that ordered all drove off before I got my food! Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \\\"homemade\\\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.",
        "Always love going to CPK. There three of us. The salad and spaghetti was excellent. Took awhile to get served, bread and a waitress. She was looking right through me as I recited my order, was slow and just not interested. I'd still go back though.",
        "Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,",
        "Had my first Short Leash Dog at the food Truck Friday a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)",
        "\\\"Good, Good, and.....GOOD!\\\" I always come for the cocktails and Thai Chicken Wraps. Service is good and I like the atmosphere, but some advice, \\\"Get there nice and early for seating on a weekend\\\".",
        "We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.",
        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "The best steak house on the strip.  The roasted steaks are great.  Fries should not be missed!  Quite expensive.  Awesome service.  Incredible wine list (study it before you dine).",
        "see the waitress?  see her ignore you?  see a bartender ?  good luck if you can find one...maybe they are hiding somewhere?  big points on the art and decor, the music is usually stellar, but the service is really lacking.  there is a really good selection of beer, somewhat pricey.  the hummus is really good.  oh but why is the Indian serving the naked goddess on the painting above the bar?  that will have you stumped for hours!",
        "I'm kinda at a lost for words because I like how the place is set up and in the beginning when you come here they make you feel happy but after you order your first round they seem to not care about serving you anymore..you literally have to call them or you never get in your second order or drink refills...you guys have some work to do..ive tried this place twice so its not because they were busy or the server..",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "My son and I had lunch at the Cubs game and was sadly disappointed. We both had the Pita Tri Tip and waited 26 minutes after we ordered for some stale bread and three small shavings of meat. When done eating, my son asked if I enjoyed my bread and onion sandwich.",
        "Cappuccino was undrinkable. It was burnt and made me want to cry. I've found that some barristas at One Coffee Co. know what they're doing and others don't.",
        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",
        "Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.",
        "Definitely a cool spot, with a great downstairs bar. The decor upstairs is unique too. Serving Richardson's menu in the meantime, but something is missing when compared to Richardson's. I can't put my finger on it, but I don't get the same feeling. Worth visiting for sure.",
        "very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning",
        "A Vegas must!  TV's everywhere, stadium seating and great food!  We LOVE our \\\"Texas connection\\\" bartender Daina. She is such a sweetheart and will make sure you have a great experience.  Without question the best sports book on the strip.",
        "Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",
        "This is my first visit to this location, I have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening. The food was good , however the service was extremely rushed! The appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed. Not a very relaxing evening.",
        "Got the beef stew special. Was very good especially when you put Hawaiian chili pepper water all ova. Broke da mouth!! My sis had the teriyaki chicken & it was sweet tender & tasty :-)\\n\\nThanks Steven & Dawn for a good dinner :-)",
        "This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I've always loved Bahama bucks and never had a problem. But today I ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice. This is ridiculous...",
        "Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service",
        "We love this place. Hard to find a restaurant that my young boys like going to and enjoy the food. Wife and I are tired of Chili's.  The gelato is fantastic. The Italian Nachos are a must.  Wow! Something on the menu for everyone. Staff is very friendly and fun. \\n\\nStuffed!",
        "Waste of time to sell clothes.. Brought what they wanted.. A&F, gap, F21, Armani exchange, juicy, JBrand, Zara, etc.. Out of 2 garbage bags full of barely used name brand clothes they bought ONE sweater for a dollar and wanted to buy my Kooba bag for $5, which i paid around $700 for. However the staff is very friendly and a good place to shop if you have the time.",
        "Great hot dogs! I had the Chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog, both were great! The fries were also good. The employees were friendly and the service was fast. The place was clean and in good order as well. Give it a try!",
        "Waste of time and money. May be kids might like it but really the blue man group's talent is not derived from them but the band playing in the back drop. The band was excellent but blue man themselves a Big disappointment. Please don't spend money on premium seating.. Category A, if u do land up going cheap seats will do.",
        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!",
        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",
        "FYI. Chili's still sucks.",
        "Hip place.  A lot of wood accents. Very open.  Downtown. Decent menu. After seating it did take a while to get a water and some attention. Staff was friendly. Nice place for groups or maybe casual meeting. Overall decent place. Highlight\\nOf the visit! MACAROONS!!  salted caramel was delicious and will surely return STRICTLY for more macaroons.",
        "I don't like giving 5's, so a 4, nice to have a Guinness, and a Guinness stew. Wife had a Sheppard's pie and was happy. Should use real mash potatoes. Servings on the large size. The fish and chips could help feed the 5000. For Vegas not bad value. Good selection of beers.",
        "For a \\\"clean\\\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \\\"grilled\\\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",

Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.",

        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.  I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.    If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!",
        "I love going here, I have only been for breakfast.  Sitting on the patio is very nice, service is great considering how busy they are.  The french toast is amazing, one order can easily be split between two people.  Sunday's seem to be busy but I have not had to wait more than 15 min. and they don't rush you when you are seated.",

        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",

        "Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!",
        "This location provided great customer experience for my 6yr old sons haircut. I appreciate the web checkin, and the friendliness of the staff. My only suggestion is that they be more attentive to customers coming in. Possible having a receptionist since it is so busy. I saw a couple of customers come and go without greeting.",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him.",
        "Food is okay. (Womens) Bathrooms are nasty, my friend had a mouse crawl over his feet (Sunday 6/23/2013) And when staff was informed, they said it had run into the kitchen and someone stepped on it. Oh okay.. Problem solved? Never been particularly impressed with service either, but that doesn't bother me much.",
        "I saw the show in Sacramento, CA and overall I liked it. All jokes, tricks was understandable as I am from Europe. I felt as I was back to my childhood . Animals and performers were good. My 8 year old son enjoyed the show. The only pros that I have that the price was too expensive for the location it was used for the show : old movie theatre that was a cheap , poor place not in a nice neighborhood .",
        "I was very impressed with the promptness and knowledge that My technician, Zack showed on my first service call.  He explained everything and took great care to advise me about the area (I am new to AZ) and showed great care for my pets and home.",
        "Pitbull Pest Control got rid of things that crawl in the night successfully for us, without all of the usual poison.  This company has organic safe insecticide solutions which are much safer than the regular poison most exterminators use.  We find it reassuring as pet owners, to know that our pets are exposed to less poison... as exterminating is a necessity in Las Vegas.",
        "Stopped in here just for the 5.00 Nathans hot dog, draw and chips. They have a condiment bar with about 30 toppings for the dogs. \\n\\nThe place itself it fairly nice, kind of a old school pub feel (lots of carved wood and nice couch/lounge areas.",
        "I miss this place.  Lots of live plants inside, and food that brought me right back home.",
        "I'm not sure what the hype is all about. We had the chicken & waffles, duck confit poutine, and a BLT. The BLT and poutine were both fine / mediocre. For me, the chicken and waffles with mustard seeds in the syrup was revolting. The decor and staff here are cool, but I regret eating here.",
        "A total waste of time. No poop bags, lots of poop everywhere, no grass, very small. My dogs thought it was boring. We are out of here.",
        "Amazing! I came here a few weeks ago, and had the best time! Be warned you'll be dancing until the sun comes up if your not careful! Females get two free drinks, thank goodness as the prices are expensive, so pre drinks before hand are a must! There is confetti and ribbons the explode from the roof! Ahhh sooo much fun! Def visit if ur in Vegas!",
        "I had my daughters baby shower here. Let me tell you I was a pain with all my changes. The banquet manager, Nova was very helpful and patient. At the event the room was beautiful, service great and the food was really good. I did not have one complaint!",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles.",
        "This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \\n\\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \\n\\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.",
        "Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame.",
        "Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks.",
        "I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review?!  I absolutely LOVE Gilbert Dogs!  The staff is great, the Facebook videos are AWESOME, and our dog Cayla always comes home happy and exhausted.  Love the fact that we can drop off or pick up at any time of day or night.  Love, love, love this place.  We drive 20+ minutes out of the way to take our dog here, and it's SO worth it!",
        "I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.",
        "It was a first time I had to take one of my pups to the hospital and it was extremely serious. The staff and doc took great care of my little one and was awesome about communicating everything to us. The doc was great about personally calling and then also following up 2 weeks after. I would recommend taking your animal here.",
        "This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.",
        "Basically my favorite \\\"creative\\\" Mexican food spot. Hands down, best guacamole in town. Get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds. The low rider margarita is awesome. Also, their signature pork dish is pretty tasty.",
        "I love a good salad - and Sammy's has some of my favorites! They have several options in the $10ish range, and service is speedy so it's a great stop for lunch. I like the shrimp salad with feta cheese and sunflower seeds and the chinese chicken salad is a close second. While their pizzas are pretty fantastic (Brie and mushroom, heck yes!), their lighter fare is quite tasty as well.",
        "Free entry so it can't hurt to go! Make sure you go downstairs, its the Scottish section. Its a nice lay out, and some of the art is really interesting--like the one of doctors about cancer. Be warned though--there may be little kids putting crowns together on the floor when you go in!",
        "Its ok. The women at the desks seem to always be very busy. But the 2 different Optometrist that I've spoken to me have always been really nice. Also he pronounced my name correctly and even showed off some of his Spanish speaking skills. Impressive\\nPros: Optometrist\\nCons: Front Desk",
        "I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place.  Everything about it was horrible.  The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever.  The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered.  The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.",
        "This arena is fun! Outside area reminds me of downtown Disney with all the music, people and food. Inside is clean but they need to lower the AC a little bit during the hockey game. It was too cold even for my male family members.",
        "Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again.",
        "Having a small dogs it's comforting to know they can be off the leash with other small dogs in an open cage area. :)",
        "Absolutely amazing! Brings a whole new dimension to hot dogs. Only the best ingredients and cooked to perfection. I had no idea that a dog this different could be so wonderful - Simply Outstanding",
        "I just wanted to say that I have had my third facial with Amber and it just keeps getting better. Having problem skin, Amber has made how I view myself so so much better. My face just keeps getting more clear with each visit. Amber is an AMAZING and SKILLED person ! Once again I highly recommend Amber to all you men and women who want to look their  best ! Thank you again Amber !",
        "I really don't understand how they still on business, they don't care about the customers that go in the store AT ALL, I order some cupcakes for my sons bday and cancel them after I think of my experience after I left the store. The owner of the store really have to do something.",
        "Clean shelter. Affordable vaccinations. Friendly staff. Quick service. And I love volunteering and walking dogs when I have a chance. One of the best shelters in the world. I would recommend to anyone who wants to adopt new pets, vaccinate, and spay or neuter current pets. You can even get a tour of the place. Really cool and caring staff. Thanks for everything Animal Foundation.",
        "Interesting an unique odds and ends from everywhere.\\n\\nI have a mixed relationship with this store. I love the opportunities to acquire stuff from ever so far away but the costs are prohibitive. I have trouble walking out of here without spending at least $100 in English candies, imported beers and spices from Asia. Grrr...",
        "The new location is huge! Been bringing my dogs to Grand Paws for a couple years. Very sweet staff, good follow up, in and out appointments!",
        "We believe the Italian food is the best here. Southern Italian is simple with just the right spices. The problem with other Southern Italian restaurants is they try to make it fancy and it don't work. This place is an authentic traditional Southern Italian Restaurant with great pastas, meatballs, and sauce.",
        "My husband and I needed new screens and batteries for our cell phones.  They were quick to fix the issues and we felt the prices were reasonable.   The store itself is a little hidden.  It's located upstairs in case anyone gets lost!",
        "Always mess up my Menudo.  Always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it. They might think this is funny. That's okay. Going to El Mirage from now on. Added picture.",
        "Took my daughters there for girls day out.  The decore is ok; I wish I could say the same thing for the food and or the service.   My daughters are grown with their own families;  none of us will be returning.",
        "Charlotte's number 1 trusted indoor dog daycare and boarding facility. Owner Nicole takes pride in every aspect of the business including extended service to help rescued dogs. There's a big reason Dogtopia has won the Best Of award. All animals must be vaccinated prior to using the facility. Services also include grooming. My dogs, #MecklenDog & #Mr704, are proud to support them. We hope you do too.",
        "Staff manager isn't that friendly or helpful, and they never have what I want in stock. It is closer to my house than PetsMart, but after three unsuccessful trips I will just head to the competitor spot to get what I need.",
        "For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry.",
        "I hope you're not here for anything other than nostalgia.\\n\\n\\\"One Orange Julius, please.\\\"  Bam...that does the trick!\\n\\nWhat's not to love about an Orange Julius?  What's to love about hot dogs from a roller grill?",
        "Up until Friday, this salon was my favorite. Unfortunately, I will not be back. I asked for the upgraded callous removal which I have successfully received in the past. My female nail tech went so far that I have raw, scabbed toes and heel...only on my right foot. Tom was my favorite tech but he was unavailable, even when I asked for him for my appointment. \\n\\nNice shop with pleasant staff but one tech ruined it for me.",
        "We enjoy walking our little maltese here (ON A LEASH) But too many Big dogs without a leash and it makes me nervous. Saw two big dogs playing with owner inside the baseball field where the sign clearly states \\\"No Dogs Allowed\\\", and also saw Big Dogs inside the \\\"Small Dog Only\\\" area.  No Respect because nobody here to enforce the rules.",
        "Stopped in for a quick lunch but it ended up taking about a half an hour to get a hot dog & fries.  The dog was good, the fries just OK.  The place was small, but clean, the menu is just burgers, dogs, a couple Mexican dishes and a bunch of different iced teas.  The service was gruff, maybe even rude.   I might stop by and try again, if I have time to kill but probably wouldn't recommend them.",
        "I recently had my make-up done by Jena for an Ahwatukee Chamber of Commerce event.  She volunteered her time to make up models for a fashion show.  She did amazing work on all the models. .we were a group of \\\"normal\\\" women of all ages and she made everyone look radiantly gorgeous!  Definitely knows what she is doing!  Highly recommend!",
        "Nasty i like hot dogs but this was just awful I have been waiting forever to try this and was so disappointed it's over priced and I could go to tj for a better hot dog and there 1$ something extra for grilled mushrooms were canned mushrooms and I couldn't even finish it but If ur hungry and here I did enjoy there chili cheese fries save ur self the seven dollars and walk away",
        "They took my favorite items off their menu but the food is still good. We sat on the patio where many birds picked food off plates. I found it interesting to watch but others found it unnerving having birds dive bomb you while you eat. The staff definitely needs to be instructed to remove plates more quickly. The birds swarm a table when people leave.",
        "Unfortunately something isn't the same - I can't put my finger on it, but the service and food has changed from what Ted's used to be- even at the Buffalo NY locations. It doesn't feel like a family owned business and the employees just don't seem to care. The hot dogs also taste different that they were 20 years ago- cutting costs?",
        "I have two dogs and have high expectations.  High allergy, older pet and a young rescue.  The name to me suggested hip, new, cool dog products.  It was not that impressive.  Some great name brands but nothing that really stood out.  I won't be going back for high quality or fun quirky products.  The person working there was great though and the reason for my stars.  He seemed honest and was very helpful.",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!",
        "I drove by 2 breakfast joints on Scottsdale Rd on Sat. am and the wait was 25mins.  Then it dawned on me that The Herb Box was in Old Town.  YEAH!  We walked right in, we were seated.  What a great place, cozy and great patio and the food was great, as always!",
        "Got to give props to any pub that serves Monster Munch, Quavers, Pringles and Doriotos behind the bar.\\nWas up for a few days as a massively gaggle of psychiatrists and mental health nurses - got nothing but a warm, friendly welcome, reasonably priced beers and a fantastic savoury snack selection from here.\\nWould come back again, and again, and again... no problem",
        "Normally the boy does not enjoy museums, but he had a lot of fun in this one.\\n\\nLots of historic sex toys and insane sex toys. Video clips, films, demonstrations. Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\\n\\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive.",
        "I have had 2 problems with this location 2 years in a row. The first one they made the cake smaller than it should have been and when I told the owner about it she acted so rude and suggested I was lying. The next year they messed up my daughters birthday cake. I ordered chocolate chip ice cream and the chips everyone realized was cheap generic ice cream that you would buy at the store in those big gallon tubs. The only saving grace was the good decoration.",
        "Nice family run restaurant. Fresh ingredients well prepared. \\nLove the spring rolls - loaded with fresh herbs and shrimp. Pho - well done. Good noodle dishes and most entrees shine as well. \\nI prefer this place for lunch or carryout, it is very quiet at dinner time, food is still very good - but the overall ambiance is somewhat depressing.",
        "Their scones are divine and it is a nice little place with fine coffee.  I only wish they would not let dogs in.  I am allergic to them and it rather spoils my meal.  If they had a sign on the door -- no dogs, except service dogs it would be fine.  The ones brought in are not service ones.  Their scones are delicious and made daily.  Go there!",
        "Awful, service is awful\\nfood not cooked all the way through\\nwill not recommend it at all.\\n\\nTHIS IS NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL OR BABIES.",
        "Food is overpriced. Service is awful. They give you two tiny pieces of bread with a sizeable appetizer, but when you ask for more bread, they act like you're robbing them. They are all incredibly rude, including the chef. Terrible ambiance, no music. Trying to be New York. Waste of time, head to Herb Box, right around the corner.",
        "Meh, meh & meh.....I'm just glad I didn't the $8-10 dogs!!!! Ordered a few dogs and was not impressed at all. The dogs they use just do not have a great texture or flavor! Ordered the poutine fries and they sucked as well! Not enough gravy, nor enough cheese curds.",
        "Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news.",
        "Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car",
        "This company rocks! We had no worries knowing they were caring for our pooches. They were diligent and detailed with their care.  We will definitely use them again and our dogs look forward to it too!",
        "Very nice and grassy park- I wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed- but over all very nice- people usually pick up after their dogs here.",
        "Late lunch here on a friday.  Chips and Salsa were awesome, the tomatoes were fresh not jarred.  Chips made in house.   Got the ribeye tacos. Ribeye could have been trimmed a little better.  Had a couple pieces of gristle in there.  Meat was flavorful but not very tender.  Overall pretty good. I would probably try different tacos though.",
        "HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \\n\\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \\n\\nThe music, however, was cool.",
        "Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.",
        "The staff here are friendly and go out of their way to assist their customers.  I had an awesome experience with a female security officer when I was there gambling she assisted my disabled friend and I up to our room and was extremely courteous.",
        "Food was disappointing. I tried loading it up with the dry spices and the sauce at the end but it was a bit bland. Having the fresh meats side by side is a little disconcerting. Overall it wasn't bad food, but I've had much better at lower prices. I'm sure if I kept going I would figure out how to get a decent tasting meal, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.",
        "Didn't live up to the hype.  My steak was OK, but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone.  We tried the arugula salad, heirloom tomatoes, asparagus along with the filet and chicken.  Steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal.",
        "This place is like an art gallery and clothing store in one.  You walk in and it's like a museum with all the wall hangings they have for sale.  They also have wooden sculptures, carved furniture and all kinds of decorations for your home.  \\n\\nThen at the back of the store they have the clothes.  Both men's and women's styles both traditional inspired and very modern looking.  They also have lots of unique jewelry and accessories as well.",
        "Rent affordable! Accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds. Staff is friendly. Quiet neighborhood.",
        "Try the pretzel dogs. They are good.",
        "The five stars is exclusively for the Bloody Mary. We were waiting for a table at The Henry on a Saturday morning and sat down at the bar for a Bloody after a very hungover blonde couldn't stop raving about it while waiting for her breakfast table. \\n\\nThe bartender described it as chipotle vodka and fresh herbs with some thai chili and it was phenomenal. I would go back just for that drink alone.",
        "Had a really great time here, tons of people and really good music, and the thing I remember MOST clearly was that there was NO line for the women's bathroom! Maybe girls are just lower maintenance or more considerate than in NYC, but I was so impressed with the lack of a bathroom line.",
        "I tried the everything bagel with salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and capers.  It was the best bagel I've ever had.  It's also the only 11 dollar bagel I've ever had.  Service was great, they accommodated my group of 5 on a very busy Sunday.  It was a good brunch, sangria, bloody Marys and tons of bagels.  Very close to a 5 star rating.",
        "The company was very flexible waiting for my house to close.   The previous owners had 12 dogs in the house and they did great.   They worked so hard we brought them back the next day to work another 4 hours.   I will definitely use them for maintenance cleaning in the future.   4000 sf house and scrubbed it all so we could move in.\\nThanks Pristine",
        "Simply amazing. I have known the owners for awhile and they are so nice! \\nThe sliders and hot dogs are so good! The french fries are also amazing. They offer a wide variety of toppings too. The chicken fingers are also good. Everything here is delicious! There is a great drink and snack selection too!",
        "Awesome burgers and dogs with a great secret sauce!!",
        "We waited 10 minutes for our food. We ordered 2 chocolate shakes. Twice. Never got them. Let them know and were still charged for it. The guy (emilio or emelio) left during the middle of making the first one. He was very sloppy and confused. Speaking of sloppy, thanks for the terribly thrown together animal style fries. 12Am. Midnight. Is when we went.",
        "This place is great for furniture and clothes.  I always find the best kids clothes here, Janie & Jack, the Gap, Old Navy etc.  The prices are good and the store is clean (if not crowded).\\n\\nFurniture is hit and miss, but when its good its good.  HUGE selection of women's shoes.",
        "Uncle bears is pretty standard as far as breweries go. The food was what you would expect, filling and somewhat greasy. The service was great, she was very patient with me wanting to try multiple beers before picking one that I liked. It's also pretty cool that they allow dogs on the patio! San tan and four peaks are better, but overall it wasn't a bad place.",
        "This place could not tell me what was wrong with my puppy, they wanted to charge me twice for the same issue and then when I asked about the charge told me that i just probably couldnt afford to pay. So upset with this I called HR do you think they cared to do anything NO! Please save yourself and animal by going to a better caring vet!"

        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "One of the more crowded and more popular places on Mill, but sometimes it will take 10-15 min to get a drink. Fun place to play some pool and have a few drinks. The long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few. Overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.",
        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "Very friendly bar staff who were even willing to show the US Open golf in between World Cup games. Would return for sure!",

There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",

Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",

        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",

        "Deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries!  My boyfriend says its one of the BEST Italian beefs he has ever had.  I would like to see more on the menu, but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best BEEF!",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "I told myself a few years ago I wouldn't go back. I gave you one more shot. Never again! \\nMeatball sandwich had two, two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich. Cheap Fu*cks! All for $8.0.",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.",
        "Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no\\nEVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses",
        "This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.",
        "A nice Whole Foods, to be sure, but considering the Fry's right down the street has great produce at better prices I'm not really sure what would send me to Whole Foods aside from perhaps a search for something esoteric.  Not really much different from the Whole Foods back home in Ohio I'll still be here anytime I need bulk fleur de sel or perhaps quality coffee in a pinch, but otherwise I just can't justify the admission price.",
        "I really go to this place to have their drinking chocolate. Its a $4.00 of pure bliss. They have 4 flavors. I always get the Mayan witch is a Slightly spicy drinking chocolate. I believe they have a new one thats more spicy than the Mayan, a white chocolate, and a plain chocolate. A must have if your over that way :)",
        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "I love sephora, but my experience in this store makes me want to only shop online. I walked through the whole store and not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed assistance. And when I did have a question no one was around to help. I saw one employee not assisting anyone, but she avoided eye contact and appeared busy fixing products on the shelf. I left the store after that and I probably will not return.",
        "The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.\\n\\nWhen returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.\\n\\nUnprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.",
        "Bad service...mediocre food...what more?",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "This place is $5 for adults $2 for kids, and everything there is to do costs even more money. The website doesnt say any of this. I'm very aggravated that i spent $11 to get me and my kids in here and still cant do anything without paying at least $3 more PER KID. I feel rather ripped off. I wont be back.",
        "I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\\n\\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\\n\\nWe will definitely stay here again.",
        "very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning",
        "No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "We couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the delicious food!! Loved everything about this place. Great way to end a day of strolling around old town Scottsdale. Perfect date spot!!",
        "I come here about once a year and then I remember why I don't come here more often. My car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me. And now I wait. Will prob take 40 mins to get out of here .",
        "Came here for dinner. Geez, no one bothered to greet us, seat us or act like we existed. Waited long enough & finally gave up & left.  Take your business & eat where they welcome customers. These people could care less",
        "This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",
        "Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore ...",
        "I had the free range chicken, which was ok.  Although it was very tender, I thought there was going to be more flavor.  The bar cheese bread was good.  The mussles were delicious.  The cheesecake was probably my favorite here.",
        "Back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love, but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel. Recommended!",
        "I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",
        "I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order \\\"venti iced stirred caramel macchiato\\\" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed \\\"not stirred\\\" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer",
        "Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.",
        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",
        "What a nightmare. Do not use them. I scheduled a cleaning and no one showed up or called. My voicemail was never returned. I called later that week and allowed them to reschedule for the following Monday. I received an email 30 min before my appt canceling the appt. Ridiculous!",
        "I like this place and agree with everyone else...\\n\\nThe crawfish was yum.  The seasoning was perfect with the perfect amount of spice.  Thank you for the gradual scale of spicyness.\\n\\nCan I get some wet wipes or something though?\\n\\nService is kind of slow.  It was busy but you would think they would compensate with more than one or two servers on a Friday night.",
        "The pizza was very good.  The service was very friendly.\\n\\n The outdoor deck upstairs is a nice touch that makes it a more pleasant place to eat and the decor was a hit with our children.\\n\\nGood place to grab a pizza.",
        "Amazing dinner experience! We had dinner on Christmas night. Set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing. The meal was glorious... Especially the chestnut soup with scallops. Service was spot-on! We had a wonderful evening and can't wait to return!",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "They're menu is constantly changing, and they're adding more items -- which is great! When they first opened there wasn't many choices.  Great place for Japanese curry, but I wish they had unlimited Japanese pickled items. Their Katsu curry is awesome!!!",
        "I went here with a Meet-up group and had a great experience. The food, service and atmosphere was terrific! We all enjoyed ourselves and will return.",
        "I had fun here while I was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home. Great variety of dishes. One step up from the hometown buffet/golden corral type buffets.",
        "Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \\n\\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "Hip place.  A lot of wood accents. Very open.  Downtown. Decent menu. After seating it did take a while to get a water and some attention. Staff was friendly. Nice place for groups or maybe casual meeting. Overall decent place. Highlight\\nOf the visit! MACAROONS!!  salted caramel was delicious and will surely return STRICTLY for more macaroons.",
        "Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.",
        "Five stars is for food only !! Hands down best pastrami I've ever had. Maybe best sandwich period. I got the pastrami Reuben on sourdough. The gentleman on the meat sliding station let me sample the corn beef and pastrami to see which I liked better. He was very friendly but the two girls working the other counters were frowning and not friendly. .  I will def be returning on my next Vegas trip.",
        "My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \\nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.",
        "Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the \\\"Motor\\\" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",
        "Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.",
        "Great little Australian themed cafe on St.Laurent, the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat. They bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home. Most importantly the few times I've been in the coffee has not disappointed,  well made espresso and lattes",
        "Milunka is wonderful!  She wants to know about your skin and she wants to educate you about your skin!  She's so sweet and nice. I truly appreciate her taking her time when I got my facial she is great at extractions she doesn't try to push her products on you. I will be returning to her again and again.....",
        "I went back for more... stir fry and bahn mi this time. Both were excellent... great proportions making it an excellent value. Awesome flavor. The people running this place are extremely nice. The bahn mi was even better than the one I get it Da Vangs, which is saying a lot since that place is still my #1 favorite for spring rolls and pho.",
        "The food tasted great, but my burger was more of a meatball than a patty. Eating it was a physical challenge which was a shame because it was so good when it finally engaged my taste buds. The service was so-so. I felt like the place was trying so hard to be hip that it was going to have an seizure. The details about it being very loud are not kidding. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet place to chat.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "This location provided great customer experience for my 6yr old sons haircut. I appreciate the web checkin, and the friendliness of the staff. My only suggestion is that they be more attentive to customers coming in. Possible having a receptionist since it is so busy. I saw a couple of customers come and go without greeting.",
        "customer service, not service at all. Agent saw me coming and dropped her head no eye contact. OK so you don't want to be bothered. There were only two of you available, so if you are too busy please hire more help this is your job \\n\\\"Customer Service\\\"",
        "I love going here, I have only been for breakfast.  Sitting on the patio is very nice, service is great considering how busy they are.  The french toast is amazing, one order can easily be split between two people.  Sunday's seem to be busy but I have not had to wait more than 15 min. and they don't rush you when you are seated.",
        "I wish I'd read the Yelp reviews prior to stopping in to Pepe's. The super burrito was anything but \\\"super\\\". The carne asada was more like tiny minced meat and the size of the burrito should've been listed as puny, especially for the price.\\n\\nThe wife's breakfast burrito was no better and she could barely eat it. Never, never, never again.",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "I have never had a better doughnut. They are like a drug you just gotta keep going back for more!",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",
        "James beard nominated chef, gourmet magazine says best Thai restaurant in north America, wine spectator award...All True and more.  Anyone who rated this place less than 4 stars needs to go back to panda express where you belong.  Incredible food, amazing wine list that's has some bottles of wine below retail.  Nothing else compares!!",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "Ice tea is awful!  Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant!  Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service.",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location.",
        "As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",
        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\\n\\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.",
        "Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "Love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries, melons, and my very favorite red beans. Always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small. Guaranteed! :)",
        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "Chips and salsa were good but that's where it ended. Dry meat on my tacos, my wife had a really bad salad. Chicken coated with sauce that was more like Italian sauce than anything Mexican.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!",
        "At Rita's kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending; I got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of. Food is OK, expected. Big hang out place, bar area seems to be more popular.",
        "Not bad for a local fish fry.  I had Steve's platter and the portion was plenty for each item.  The wife had a two item combo and had more oysters than anyone could assume in one setting.  The kids enjoyed the kid menu items.  We had about a 25 min wait that was not expect, but went fairly quickly as they moved consumers in and out quickly.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department."

        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "The driver, Daniel, was early to the pickup, so there was no pressure on the drive. He was courteous and helpful. I called other cabs to compare prices and they were by far the cheapest to the airport. Great value indeed!",
        "Freed's Bakery made ordering a custom cake a breeze! It was a week before my friends and I would be going to vegas to celebrate a birthday. They made a delicious red velvet cake and delivered it to the restaurant w/ no hiccups!\\n\\nWe ordered a red velvet cake w/ irish bailey filling and butter cream frosting. The cake was so moist, the girls and I devoured it.\\n\\nthanks for everything!",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "Not bad, service was on the slower side, but then again it was lunch time 12-1pm but very friendly and quick cashier",
        "My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!",
        "This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.",
        "calling it the best ball park in America is a total understatement, its the greatest ever. not a bad seat there. Pittsburgh has been very lucky, we hit home runs with PNC & Console but of course Heinz Field is a turkey. As Meat Loaf would say 2 out of 3 ain't bad!!!!",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "I would like to give a review but they were out of mostly all the great goodies that were recommended to me, therefore I will have to go back after the holiday.",
        "Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.",
        "Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",

        "This is the BEST breakfast in all of Pittsburgh.  Service is always good.  Seating is limited but it's worth the wait if you find a line.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Never having has gellato before, this was definitely a lot easier on the wallet and feet than going over to the ice creamery on The Strip. Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review! Durango/215.",
        "Food presentation was great and the chips and salsa was really yummy. Actual meal was okay. I had the El Pastor tacos and husband had enchiladas. Not bad not great. Our waiter was just okay too. Won't go back",
        "I LOVE the lunch specails here... Panang Chicken is my favorite mmmm mmm And you can adjust your spice level, I always have to tone it down just a little on the spice!!",
        "This bar is attached to another bar in the cityscape area. The place was packed and it was difficult to move around anywhere. Bi didn't get to see the whole place but I did not see any places to sit only stand.  The attractive features of this place are the dance floor where you are able to work off some of those calories that you just drank and the arcade which makes you feel like a kid again.  Although the selection of games is limited.",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-",
        "Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.",
        "Good food, but not top of the line. Love the portion size for the price! Not crowded especially at lunch, and really reliable takeout. The queso blanco gets hard quick. Especially love the saucy fajitas.",
        "This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.",
        "Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",
        "I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.",
        "Possibly the best food bargain outside of a down-market casino in Las Vegas!\\n\\nThey don't have In-N-Out Burger in Chicago, where I'm from, so I always try to stop here when I'm in Vegas.  The food is really fresh, including hand-cut french fries.  Avoid this place on the weekends and during lunch, however; it gets really crowded.",
        "We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.",
        "Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego.",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "I don't get what all the craze is about. My burrito was just okay---I had better burritos in Boston which doesn't really say much about haberneros. It's better than all the chain burrito places but it doesn't leave me saying \\\"wow. That was good.\\\"",
        "I love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work :)  I've never had lunch or eaten here...someday soon, will have to try it.",
        "My son and I had lunch at the Cubs game and was sadly disappointed. We both had the Pita Tri Tip and waited 26 minutes after we ordered for some stale bread and three small shavings of meat. When done eating, my son asked if I enjoyed my bread and onion sandwich.",
        "One of those places you just go when you are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian because it's so convenient, has that menu item that every person in your party wants whether it be fake pho noodle soup or a burger, and you can crawl into the restaurant at 1:00am to satisfy your drunk hunger.... \\n\\nThe bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal.\\nThe service is really slow....",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "Went there for lunch today and had a very good turkey and brie sandwich.",
        "Aloha Friday laulau plate with the butterfish was a real winnah. Customer service was down right island style.",
        "Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.",
        "Get the jack Mac, very good. Went for lunch. (Get the bowl if you're hungry.)\\n\\nDefinitely go back.",
        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",
        "Good food. They sell kids meal that is just right for me. It includes a slider (which is pretty much a full sized burger) , French fries (fresh and generous portion) and drink, for like 6 bucks. This is my favorite airport food actually. The bar next to it is a good place to hangout for a beer when waiting for your next flight.",
        "Breakfast all day. Healthy portions.  Tiny diner but food was very fast.   No substitutions and no Amex.",
        "Definitely a cool spot, with a great downstairs bar. The decor upstairs is unique too. Serving Richardson's menu in the meantime, but something is missing when compared to Richardson's. I can't put my finger on it, but I don't get the same feeling. Worth visiting for sure.",
        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!",
        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus.",
        "My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",
        "Worst excuse for mexican food, ever.  Who messes up tacos??? Tacos were full of fatty meat and the avocado was brown. Yuck. Absolutely terrible service to boot. I'll never come here again",
        "Very good authentic Cuban food. Wish the place was a bit busier as I would like to see them succeed. We had a marvelous meal and the waitress was very helpful. We will go back as it is on our minds constantly.",
        "Great hot dogs! I had the Chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog, both were great! The fries were also good. The employees were friendly and the service was fast. The place was clean and in good order as well. Give it a try!",
        "My friends and I were walking down the strip really hungry and we had no idea what to get until we saw Tamba.  The restaurant is kind of hidden in a shopping center,  but I'm glad we found it. Great service and great food! I got the buttered chicken with rice and garlic pita bread soo good!",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!",
        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "Food was very good! Great breakfast variety and lunch options as well. Love the dog friendly patio! Amanda was a great waitress! Very friendly :) I will definitely be coming back.",
        "Amazing dinner experience! We had dinner on Christmas night. Set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing. The meal was glorious... Especially the chestnut soup with scallops. Service was spot-on! We had a wonderful evening and can't wait to return!",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",
        "Great airport bar that is quick and easy...and good  Def recommend if your waiting for a plane outta charlotte!",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "Great burgers, love to make my own salad. I always do the create your own small salad as a meal and it's plenty. Kids like the sliders and fried pickles. The kids love their milkshakes and I have to admit they are really good. Burgers always are cooked right and flavorful.  All of the ingredients are fresh...this is one of our go to places.  It also has a full bar and drinks that have some bang!",
        "Good for a quick lunch, big variety. Vitamin selection is OK, seems overpriced.",
        "Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \\n\\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "I wasn't here very long, just long enough to half kill myself walking five miles, loaded down with carry ons, from my arrival gate to the departure gate.  Ugh.  If you're gonna make people walk halfway across the city for a connecting flight, at least provide some sort of shuttle or something.  NOT an airport I care to go through again.",
        "For a \\\"clean\\\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \\\"grilled\\\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "Hard to beat a pretty decent meal for 2 adults and 2 kids for under $20\\nGood subs, kids friendly and good location.\\nGood option for sunday's lunch!",
        "Great donuts and open 24/7.  I love their buttermilk donuts and they have these adorable little filled donut holes.",
        "Great little Australian themed cafe on St.Laurent, the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat. They bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home. Most importantly the few times I've been in the coffee has not disappointed,  well made espresso and lattes",
        "Can't review this place as I walked in and was told a 45 minute wait. I am sure the food must be good but I honestly won't wait 45 minutes for anything to eat. No matter how good something is there always is another option...this time it was Feast Buffet at Santa Fe.",
        "We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre.",
        "It's certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places, but it really ought to go all the way to the airport.  Also, considering the short distance of travel, $5 is quite a lot.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things.",
        "I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!",
        "Love Butters! Perfect pancakes, tasty turkey bacon, gourmet grits, creamy caramel macchiato,  fresh squeezed orange juice, and quick, efficient service! Nummmy!",
        "Ordered a meal for pickup, went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it.",
        "This was our first time trying Mickey's Tavern. I had the Eggplant Panino and the boyfriend had the Mickey burger. We upgraded to try the sexy fries and super sexy fries. We were both wildly impressed by everything. High quality meal for awesome prices and a fun chill vibe on a Monday evening. I guess some guys get together every Monday to jam- we left before they started but it was a very friendly environment.",
        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",
        "Good place to grab a quick lunch, weather you're looking for a slice of pizza, sandwich, or pasta.  Be sure to check out their daily specials!",
        "Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Sushi was awesome.  We had the Philly, Naruto, Rainbow, Spicy Tuna rolls.  The seviche was fantastic.  Drinks are well priced and the variety is great.  I will go back often, one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.  You can't go wrong with Tamari."

        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "Love the opera renditions. Bring me to tears.\\nMinus a star for Faith Hill and \\\"contemporary\\\" selections.\\n\\nMy favorite thing in Vegas.",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "Small portions & expensive. Waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu or drinks. My specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it... It didn't. Lasagna was tiny.. Pizza was okay. I didn't mind it.. Nothing special tho.",
        "Wide, comfortable, reclining chairs perfect for cuddling and watching a movie?  Yes please!  So worth the extra $3 it costs over Harkins.",
        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "We live close by and couldn't wait for this place to open! Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. \\nAlthough service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery... Overall poor quality or just old food! \\nToo bad because this place looks nice and clean but they just need new cooks and recipes??!",

        "Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "With so many decent taquerias in Chandler, differentiating isn't easy. But Senor Taco sets itself apart with tortilla-shell bowls (like a taco salad) and salsa bar that includes roasted peppers.",

        "I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",

        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "Verdict: Good before, but \\\"meh\\\" now. \\n\\nThis place was pretty good and always gave us exactly what we ordered, but now they give us half the portions of what we used to get. \\n\\nI don't know if maybe they recently changed owners, but we won't be coming back here anymore.",
        "Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating.\\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars.",
        "We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.",
        "Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills.",
        "I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but this place is delicious. I've been here a few times and got a couple different sandwiches and one of their bowls and everything I've had was really good. I'll take their Big WAC over a Big Mac any day.",
        "Pitbull Pest Control got rid of things that crawl in the night successfully for us, without all of the usual poison.  This company has organic safe insecticide solutions which are much safer than the regular poison most exterminators use.  We find it reassuring as pet owners, to know that our pets are exposed to less poison... as exterminating is a necessity in Las Vegas.",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)",
        "Seems like a nice place but there are not many vegan options. Even the Veggie Burger comes with mayo and a non vegan bun.\\n\\nI had the black bean veggie chili and a salad without cheese.  Both were delicious and the presentation was excellent.  I would rate Eat higher, if there were a few more vegan selections.",
        "I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",
        "Every time we visit Vegas we HAVE to make a stop here, Yeah we have Amoeba (we live in LA) but I prefer a smaller setting where I wont feel like I'm having an anxiety attack because there is so much to choose from! I like the little novelty Items they carry and you can find some great gems if you look hard, I like how cheap the dvds are.",
        "This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!",
        "One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!",
        "This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\\ngood prices and a great selection.   \\nNeed chairs to sit and read.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \\nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",
        "Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price.

Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "this place is beautiful, came here for a romantic dinner was lovely views of the castle - the only thing is that if you're sitting with your back to it you don't get to see much which is a little rubbish! they could rearrange the chairs and tables so everyone can see the stunning views!\\nthe food was great, as was expected and there was a waiter for every course - including for the bread, and the wine. it was great service.",
        "probably the only place i come for dimsum. great prices and selections. they are always well staffed and you have dimsum carts always moving and restocking.\\n\\nthey have this coconut pastry bun. its the shiz, so good...\\n\\nmy favorite dimsum dish is the chicken feet.",
        "Place was good. Very friendly owners. Menu was good if you're looking to stay with a familiar territory. I could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go. We found John to be a very nice guy.",
        "Tip...go for a really late lunch, (3:30pm or so) and hang around for the dinner selections that come out about 4:30pm. \\n\\nReally nice buffet! Great variety of selections! \\n\\nThe crab legs were a bit salty. \\n\\nVery friendly/helpful staff!",
        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "Premium drinks. Whether I'm in need for caffeine boost or a relaxing personalized and seasonal cocktail. Have always been so pleased with their product!\\n\\nFood and pastry selections never disappoint.\\n\\nIt's not surprising that this place is busting at the seams busy but I can't say that I've ever felt neglected or that their quality of service/product has suffered!",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",
        "We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel....",
        "Best pizza in Arizona. Arizona had been waiting for this for a long time!!  We were customers in IL and the owners have kept up the exact same quality and service!!  We didn't want to move back to IL to have great pizza!!!  Thank you Buzzyz for always delivering a superior product.",
        "No hot water. Called the front desk and was told to let the water run half an hour first. I let it run an hour on both days and still no hot water. Coffee machine in toom didn't work correctly and one of the lights didn't have a bulb. Did have a mini fridge amd air conditioning which was nice but without hot water, can't take a nice shower. Would not stay again.",
        "A while back the two Marigold owners started a seemingly Madison revolution in cuisine and I've loved going ever since.  I love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere.  If only it weren't so chaotic and crowded, but why should I think such a great place wouldn't get noticed?",
        "Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.",
        "My brother and i are in Vegas for the weekend.  First stop was Zia.  Very cool store with a nice vinyl selection.  We went for the vinyls, but we stayed for everything else.  Friendly staff, other customers were awesome too, and so many cds, dvds, and much more.  The haul my brother and i scored here prompted us to fedex our records home, rather than trust the airlines with the great stuff we found @  zia.  Highly recommended.",
        "I love a good salad - and Sammy's has some of my favorites! They have several options in the $10ish range, and service is speedy so it's a great stop for lunch. I like the shrimp salad with feta cheese and sunflower seeds and the chinese chicken salad is a close second. While their pizzas are pretty fantastic (Brie and mushroom, heck yes!), their lighter fare is quite tasty as well.",
        "You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking.",
        "Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out.",
        "Typical jack in the box.  Clean.  Staff is friendly.  Drive thru open 24 hours.  They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.\\n\\nPersonal favorites include:\\negg nog shake during the holiday season\\ntacos\\nultimate cheeseburger",
        "Had lunch with a colleague on a Thursday. Look over the Bento selections and against my better judgement went with the Salmon Teriyaki. Not good, not bad just very average. \\nI like the happy hour, it is always a lively time and drink and food specials are great and deserve 4 stars. Just was not impressed with lunch there.",
        "I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself",
        "Decent Cali-Mexi cuisine at reasonable prices. Don't come here expecting large plates, the servings are smallish. We've been a few times because a friend loves their bar-b-que tofu, and both their vegan(ish) burrito (the Green Burrito, if I remember correctly) and the Taco Salad with tofu were satisfying. Not outstanding, but consistent, with decent service.",
        "Since Sambalatte opened its doors in Summerlin, I became a huge fan! I LOVE their Nutella Latte and the variety of tea selections they have. This place makes you feel as if you were not even in Las Vegas! A great escape,awesome lattes...all at Sambalatte ...Goodbye Starbucks!",
        "Attended the Sammy Hagar event 10/18/14\\n\\nONE HOUR BEER LINES!!! Absolutely unacceptable for Vegas standards. It's run by the owner of the \\\"D\\\" so the \\\"D\\\" must stand for dysfunctional. \\n It has potential but I have no intentions to ever return. I could have drove home and got a beer out of my fridge before we were served here.",
        "Everything was expertly prepared and the service was wonderful! The quality of the ingredients was amazing, and the place was very comfortable, slightly rustic but still beautiful and trendy. The braised beef, truffle pizza, and cheesecake were my favorites! Food came out in a reasonable time, and even though my friends and I stayed a while after we finished eating, we never felt rushed. I will definitely be back!",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "The muffins are dry and over-baked. The selection is sparse. And the owners are RUDE. Enough said.",
        "Went for a Birthday party in a large group,  we had the private dining room booked.  Great quality food, a little expensive but i guess its true you get what you pay for.  Had Prawn Tempura starter and Chicken Pad Thai main course.  All very well done and presented.",
        "They were really nice and welcoming here at the Gelato Bar.  The staff lets you try  anything flavor you want.  There is fruit flavored gelatos to coffee and vanilla.  The coffee and vanilla were my favorites.  I would definitely go back here again.  I love this place.",
        "The Sunday brunch is . It's served butler style (they bring the plates to the table). All the plates are absolutely delicious. They have bottomless drinks for an extra $20. It's a great deal and different experience compared to other buffets. It's for sure worth  a try.",
        "This place was WONDERFUL the first few times I went, but has been very spotty for the last few months.  I'm not sure what the issue is, but I have noticed new staff, and probably more importantly, I no longer see the owners in there.... ever.  They used to always be there and the food was great, now they're never there and the food is just \\\"OK\\\".  Sucks for me.",
        "The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!",
        "Food is very good, the owners are very friendly.  I would have given them a 5-star however it typically takes 10-20 minutes to get your food (and this is simple mexican food), secondly they don't have free chips & salsa.  Their Texax Burrito and the Al Pastor plate are both very good.",
        "I love having this place so close to home.  You can depend on them for all the basics when you're feeling a little Asian inspiration in the kitchen.\\n\\nI especially like the people who work there.  They're always friendly and will help you out if you can't find what you need.\\n\\nThe fresh produce/meat/fish components of this shop are a little . . . well, kinda dicey, but otherwise, thumbs up all the way.",
        "Just had my haircut an hour ago and already two strangers have complimented the cut. Jason's work is the best in town.  He really understands how to make wavy, unruly hair look fabulous.  Plus, the scalp massage, complimentary coffee and hip setting makes one feel they are getting the star treatment.",
        "Awesome! Tons of new and used here. CDs, DVDs, bluerays and albums - that have it all. Staff is very friendly.",
        "If you are having a party and need some inexpensive decorations then the 99 Cents store is the place to be. Packs of two streamers. 99 cents. Package of 20 balloons. 99 cents. Plates, utensils, napkins. You guessed it, 99 cents. The kicker, they have plenty of colors to go with almost any color scheme.",
        "Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.",
        "Big rooms. Clean but have a smell to them. The included 7a-10a buffet breakfast is good (needs sausages,though). Nice to have that refrigerator & microwave,too. Free shuttle to the airport on the half hour was extremely convenient. Tipping at breakfast and with the shuttle (which can take or pick you up at places in less than a 2 mile radius) is appreciated just the same as you would your housekeeper.",
        "Very nice little restaurant in cave creek area.  Family run restaurant.  Very Nice and polite owners.  I really like the pho there.  Thats what I get every time I go there.",
        "I am always pleased at Galileo's. The food is phenomenal and you can't find better service anywhere else. The owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home.",
        "Great food, decent prices.  We got 2 breakfast plates and a coffee $13.99.  2 pancakes 2 eggs, potatoes,  2 sausage & 2 biscuits and gravy,  2eggs, bacon, potatoes.   We were seated within 5 minutes.   Service was nice and sufficiently fast.  They even made drinks to go.  Very awesome.",
        "Great bar atmosphere with Chinese food! Good waitress but needed help with our large group! Food Ok!  Lots of beer selections!",
        "Pretty good area! Low limits and players are friendly and not too cut throat. Just know the basic strategies and being able to pick up on play styles and you will have a good time.\\n\\nI prefer playing blackjack in all honesty but this is still a nice place for a change of pace.",
        "The sushi here is very fresh and I always enjoy my meal. I would recommend to anyone in the mood for high quality sushi. Prices can be a little high for specialty rolls.",
        "We eat at most sushi place in town and thhis is the worse sushi place.  Chef wasn't friendly.  Ayce menu had little selections and lots lots of rice.  All the roll taste the same.  We can't order dinnner menu items at the sushi bar.  So if anyone doesn't eat sushi in your party they need to sit by themself.  Do not waste your money. I'm beeing nice with 1 star.",
        "This place is horrible! \\n\\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?",
        "Very friendly, warm atmosphere at this location.. The skill level of the therapists is A One. the laser hair removal is PAIN free.  Massage and facials could,t get better.  It is a must to try.",
        "Found on yelp. Was staying at the Westin and was looking for non hotel dining.  Walked a few blocks and then found out it was part of sheraton. Bummer. Food was decent. Service was good. Just not what I imaged...a small urban wine bar with small plates.",
        "I have taken my pup, Buena, here many times for both doggie day care and boarding over the weekend.  The owners/staff are always happy to see us and always take good care of Buena.  Best part is she comes home totally exhausted!",
        "We used to go to this restaurant all the time and used to love it. They recently changed owners and this places is not the same. The menu is different.  The drinks are not as good. The origin of the wines are no longer shown on the wine list. The prices are much higher. The place has lost its Spanish ambiance.  The little touches such as the shot of liquor at the end of the meal has been discarded. Would not be back again.",
        "This food was seriously delicious. I hate to say it but i am seriously \\\"craving\\\" one of their bowls right now. The flavors are well done and their products are fresh. If you want a healthy and delicious meal, you need to here. They have tons of gluten free options, vegetarian and vegan dishes for all of your dietary needs. Head on over!",
        "Since I've eaten at pubs throughout England I was a bit disappointed.   Obviously,  you are only paying for ramseys name, because if this is how he cooks then he needs a new profession.  We ordered pretzel sticks, bangers n mash, and fish n chips.  I've fried fish that tasted better.  The fries were so limp they should be put down.",
        "Great bagels, amazing pickles, and decent prices. The staff here is always friendly. The bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home. I love Chompies for breakfast. Try one of their eggs Benedict plates. You won't be disappointed.",
        "Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available.",
        "I just love this food! I especially enjoy Mon-Fri lunch. You have the opportunity to several different items without spending a fortune. It can be a bit expensive in the evening, but lunch is just right! The food is all made fresh the very moment you order! No pre-made soup here! Highly recommend it! The owners are awesome!",
        "Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.",
        "This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those.",
        "Very good happy hour, great wine and cheese selections. Service was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!",
        "We really liked this place. The owners were friendly. The specialty drinks were good and pizza was really out of this world.",
        "I come here about two times a week, but I have noticed that their prices are steadily going up and up. Not only that, the portion size has been shrinking. One of my favorite plates used to be $4.95, then it went up to $5.95 and now it's $6.95! This is all within a year! Taste wise, their pho is great and so is their fried rice plates. Customer service is pretty poor.",
        "one of the worst ive seen next to frank and lupe's .  the grisly adams dip sh@* bartender was using the toilet plunger, from the bathroom, with sh@*  on it to unclog the sink  which held ice he was serving in  drinks.   the place smelled like feces and look like it had never been cleaned. shame on everyone at dave's electric fecal matters..",
        "I got the Kyawe Soup which is a rice noodle soup. Really tasty and reminds me of food I get at home. My friend got the Kyar San Hingar which is a similar noodle soup and just as good. Didn't try the sushi, but my friend got the 16 piece and they gave him 20. Owners were really nice."

        "Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole",
        "Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store.",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",
        "Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",
        "Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \\n\\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).",
        "Super expensive, but a beautiful setting..I have only been to camelback inn to \\\"spa\\\" and thought I would try some place new.  Had a great expresso mud wrap and massage with Damian from Poland.  As a mother of 4, I was not cool with hearing kids scream at the pool DURING MY service.  And the maintainence man on his walky-talky outside my room wasn't very nice either.",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "Never had a bad drink from this store. The drive thru can get a little long, but it's worth the wait.",
        "Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working",

        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",

So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)",
        "I love sephora, but my experience in this store makes me want to only shop online. I walked through the whole store and not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed assistance. And when I did have a question no one was around to help. I saw one employee not assisting anyone, but she avoided eye contact and appeared busy fixing products on the shelf. I left the store after that and I probably will not return.",
        "I'm kinda at a lost for words because I like how the place is set up and in the beginning when you come here they make you feel happy but after you order your first round they seem to not care about serving you anymore..you literally have to call them or you never get in your second order or drink refills...you guys have some work to do..ive tried this place twice so its not because they were busy or the server..",

        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Milunka is fabulous! She is gentle , sweet, and very informative. She takes her time to get to know your skin type and your daily activities. I am an acne sufferer and she knows exactly how to treat me and my face. My husband even goes to her now and he loves it. We have seen her twice and I highly recommend anyone who wants to get a facial to go and see Milunka!!",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)",
        "I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "The food is good that's why we come here but we will be finding a new one to go to every time we come the staff is unprofessional messing around  yelling across the store to one another 2 different visits they were cursing one time they were complaining about another guest and they always have the same Spanish soap opera on the tv I thought this was a family friendly place",
        "Cheap food and booze? Im in!\\n\\nGot to love Firefly for many reasons besides the cheap dishes and booze! The atmosphere, people and servers make it all meld together perfectly.\\n\\nMost dishes here are delicious and the one i was particularly fond of was the lamb chops! Two for about $10?! Amazing! \\n\\nCheck out my Firefly food pictures among other on my Instagram! @dentalgaymer",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "A delightful waiter...excellent mango mojitos...a most interesting appetizer...a delectable pan bread, very good entrees.  What's not to like?  Although the restaurant is in the Pima Crossings strip mall, the owner has done an excellent job with the internal decor.",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!",
        "A very tight parking lot for this Walgreens and I would seriously recommend that you monitor your surroundings when you're going from the store to your car. It is a very tight parking lot.\\n\\nI didn't go in on this particular visit - we used the drive-through and had a great clerk taking care of our prescription. Top notch and just for her, she gets a star. Otherwise it would have been a one star visit.",
        "These stores are HUGE and there's never anyone in them. How they stay in biz is beyond me. Any who, there were plenty of workers around to try to help me find an anti-glare screen for my lappy 5000, but it turns out they do not sell this product anymore. Boo. Need a sharpie or a binder? Come here. Need anything beyond that? Call Amazon.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",
        "Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \\nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.",
        "Service was great. The server was very friendly and knowledgable. Soup was pretty good. For the entrees i had the  Pollo Rosa Maria Stuffed with fontina and prosciutto, topped with mushrooms and a basil lemon butter sauce. Really great dish. My friend karlee had the manicotti. She liked it. We also had this chocolate bread pudding. I have to admit it was good as well even though im not a huge chocolate fan.",
        "Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!",
        "Went last night. Keep in mind I've been here dozens of times.  Our server didn't give a hoot about our table of five. We ordered the pickles and they were slimy. Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like \\\"hi! Um.....nooooo\\\". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky \\\"manager\\\".",
        "The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "Busy place with a long wait...\\n\\nFood was mediocre....\\n\\nBUT their margaritas were super good. I'd come back just for those!!!",
        "Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",
        "Dr. Nathan Blanton was the reason I used to go to this location of Mountain West Chiropractic. Since Dr. Blanton is no longer practicing at this office, I stopped receiving treatment here.  I have now have no idea of the quality of treatment this office now provides.",
        "A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "The food is amazing.\\n\\nThe service is wonderful.\\n\\nIf your lactose intolerant just add Parmesan and cut out the mozzarella.\\n\\nThank you for the food and wonderful service.\\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer and 4 pizzas. It fed 5 people very well.  Try the home grown peppers they are great.",
        "Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave",
        "I had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant.",
        "So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  \\n\\nThe store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.",
        "Pitbull Pest Control got rid of things that crawl in the night successfully for us, without all of the usual poison.  This company has organic safe insecticide solutions which are much safer than the regular poison most exterminators use.  We find it reassuring as pet owners, to know that our pets are exposed to less poison... as exterminating is a necessity in Las Vegas.",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)",
        "Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned.",
        "Excellent presentation.\\nNice decor (unchanged from painted pony)\\nCalamari appetizer so so.\\nGood service.",
        "The reason for 2 stars.  Order accuracy!  My food has been wrong the last 3 times!  I ordered 3 quesa tacos for my lady and me.  We ordered 2 shrimp and 1 carnitas.  We got  2 beef and 1 carnitas.  The server said the ticket was correct.  This is the third time this happened!  Don't get me wrong, the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time.",
        "I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(",
        "I'm not sure what the hype is all about. We had the chicken & waffles, duck confit poutine, and a BLT. The BLT and poutine were both fine / mediocre. For me, the chicken and waffles with mustard seeds in the syrup was revolting. The decor and staff here are cool, but I regret eating here.",
        "10/29/13 - Edit - Since my last edit I've been to Sleepy dog many times and they've continued to shine. The menu has been revamped with quality made from scratch food, the staff seems to know what they're doing as I haven't had a long wait for anything. I can say that Sleepy Dog has changed my opinion about their brewbub, changing my review to 4 stars. I highly recommend a pint of Red Rover!",
        "Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store",
        "Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here.",
        "I have NEVER had such a great experience ordering flowers. This is truly customer service at its highest level. Tony did a fantastic job helping me to order flowers for my girlfriend and at such last minute as well. NOT only did he provide excellent service, he made a special run to the grocery store to purchase an add-on item I wanted to send her. \\nWOW!! I am truly impressed with their great service and help.",
        "Wow, this place is fantastic!!!!\\n\\nIf you want more than just stores to look at while you're shopping, Caesar's is the place to be.  They have almost everything you're looking for, and the space is amazing.  \\n\\nI've even spotted a few celebrities while I was shopping here!",
        "The restaurant was pretty much empty except for our family and another group. The salsa was good and the server was friendly and helpful. We had a variety of food: tacos, enchiladas and carne asada. Unfortunately the food was bland and not very good. Perhaps we caught the chef on a bad day.",
        "I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\\n\\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience.",
        "They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed, they don't have a great selection, the decor is predictable (although they do have a nice set of high tables) and the lighting is a bit weird. It is a good place to have a good conversation though - just be warned, it might leave you feeling blue too.",
        "To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two.",
        "Worst Home Depot I've ever been to. Needed a sheet of plywood cut and was told by 3 different people someone would be with me. I waited for 30 minutes for something that should have taken 5 minutes at the most. The store was empty and there were employees near the front in a circle on their phones. No excuses for their inability to help.",
        "Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame.",
        "Not a big casino like others on the strip. What I liked about this place was that it wasn't crowded. Next time I would like to hit up the stores during business hours.",
        "These reviews are so right this is the worst store I have ever been to. There is a man who works there named Jason that is the rudest person I have ever met.  I have only found one sales person in there that knows what they are doing and has a good attitude.",
        "Amazing amount of TVs for the size of the place. Really large selection of beers in bottle & on tap, though the best options are in the bottle - hope they revisit their tap selection soon. Burger was good, I preferred it to the one's I've had at Burger Rehab. Great place to watch a game(s)."

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "I have never, ever not enjoyed myself at Petra's! Its grown up & sexy, 21 & up, the atmosphere & ambiance are on point and its generally just the perfect place for a night out! Great date night place for an intimate experience, especially for LGBT, but I think anyone could enjoy themselves here!",

        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole",
        "Loved it! I was visiting from NYC with a few friends, and we decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!",
        "This Walgreen's has it all! ! Everything you could possibly need from souvenirs to spirits. Great customer service with plenty of cashiers for check out.",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "Wasn't to impressed with there bacon & cheddar sandwich. The bacon was cold,eggs were mediocre,cheese tastes nasty. I asked them to toast it,they didn't. It tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. The only thing that was good was the asiago bagel.",
        "Fun.  Like many things in Vegas, this copy of the Munich Hoffbrau Haus has all of the form and none of the substance.  If you're looking for an authentic experience, this only partly fits that bill.  That said, the place is blast and I've always had a good time.",

I took photos just to prove what was delivered.",

        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",

        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",

        "I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \\\"smokers\\\" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.",
        "Love the opera renditions. Bring me to tears.\\nMinus a star for Faith Hill and \\\"contemporary\\\" selections.\\n\\nMy favorite thing in Vegas.",
        "This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "My boyfriend and I love this place! Great mojitos and be ready to eat! Great lighting. Lots of room.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "Stay away from  their clearance sales!!!  We stopped at the Carefree location, which was having a clearance sale.  Sadly, we spent over $50 on what turned out to be vinegar.  There's no way I can possibly go through 6 bottles of red wine vinegar.  What a waste of my time, money, and wine.  I didn't even get what I paid for.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "This is pretty nice for the money. It's sort of hard to find as you walk down the street. It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.",
        "Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Marita and now Michelle are my go to hair stylist!  They do such an amazing job on coloring my thick crazy hair.  \\n\\nMy hair never gets damaged and the results are exactly what I want. Thank you Marita and Michelle - love your work!",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Gotta agree with the praise for Los Gemelos. Great $3 sopes, tasty tacos too! All freshly made that should be freshly made. Contento!",
        "Great ice cream (Perry's, which is especially exciting for me since I'm from the Buffalo area), great flavors, great service and for a great cause.  I'll be trying to earn that 11th free ice cream!",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "A lot of people love the Mirage... I'm not a big fan. \\n\\nI like it there. It's okay. It's in a decent location, it has some good restaurants, some bars and other things, it just doesn't tickle my fancy much. Maybe it's the middle-aged vibe? It feels older. The crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub.",
        "Actually, it seems to be on the last Sunday of every month now--you'll need to check their website for dates: http://www.chaiyacmm.org/\\nIt's well worth it to find this event! Every time we go, there are a few different things.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",
        "Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",
        "Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side.",
        "Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\\nWe both got sick after.",
        "Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. \\n\\nThe pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. \\n\\nThe one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.",
        "Never having has gellato before, this was definitely a lot easier on the wallet and feet than going over to the ice creamery on The Strip. Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "This is the Best Dunkin Donuts we have ever visited!!! The staff is always friendly, fast, and makes you feel valued.  Whenever we're craving DD coffee or a donut, we always know it will be a consistently great experience at the DD at Greenfield Rd, and the 60. Thank you DD for the awesome coupons too!",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review!

        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here.  While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there.  Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in..."

        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.",
        "Wasn't to impressed with there bacon & cheddar sandwich. The bacon was cold,eggs were mediocre,cheese tastes nasty. I asked them to toast it,they didn't. It tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. The only thing that was good was the asiago bagel.",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.",
        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",

        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",

I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again",

We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",

        "Organized a business breakfast here and was impressed by how attentive and efficient the service was. We were seated at a great table facing the windows. I really liked the little chair they offered for purses, too cute.\\n\\nI had the duck hash & eggs which was delicious, although the pancakes looked great too. Tableau is perfectly classy and elegant, yet casual at the same time.",

Must try their brownie. It's freshly made with your choice of ice cream on top. It's very good, but only when it is hot. When it gets cold, it won't taste as good. So eat it fast.",

        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. \\nemployee came and reprimanded her.",
        "If you are a fan of Legume in the previous location, you should definitely experience the restaurant in their new digs.  There is a wonderful spaciousness, plus the same attention to detail.  Really great food with a farm to table sensibility, creativity, and delicious food.  The other thing that is new is a fabulous wine list with lots of great and surprising choices.  Highly recommended.",
        "This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.",
        "Three of us got a room for one night last month.  The hotel has 11 floors; we were in room 1083.  We discovered at midnight that the penthouse directly above our room has a bowling lane.  Google it.\\nIt sounds exactly like you would think.  After much back and forth, they comped our room.  I'm amazed they put a room under that suite.  Clueless or greedy, we won't be back.\\nStay away from the 10th floor.",
        "For a \\\"clean\\\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \\\"grilled\\\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "I was not impressed by this restaurant.The staff was friendly and the food was quick. However, the ingredients were not anything you couldn't throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost ( and personally this pizza lacked all flavor.) I most likely will not dine here again.",
        "FYI, the prices listed on the menu linked to this profile are lower than what is on the menu at the restaurant. The burgers average about .50 and higher. The hickory loaded for example is really 9.79. Otherwise great food.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",
        "losing a star.  Since they've gone to 24/7 hours, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  They turn so many tables I don't think they care about service anymore.  Still the best spot for viet food in LV but viet food shouldn't be too expensive, it's comfort food from a 3rd world country!",
        "This location provided great customer experience for my 6yr old sons haircut. I appreciate the web checkin, and the friendliness of the staff. My only suggestion is that they be more attentive to customers coming in. Possible having a receptionist since it is so busy. I saw a couple of customers come and go without greeting.",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.  I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.    If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "The food is good that's why we come here but we will be finding a new one to go to every time we come the staff is unprofessional messing around  yelling across the store to one another 2 different visits they were cursing one time they were complaining about another guest and they always have the same Spanish soap opera on the tv I thought this was a family friendly place",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.",
        "This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill",
        "I saw the show in Sacramento, CA and overall I liked it. All jokes, tricks was understandable as I am from Europe. I felt as I was back to my childhood . Animals and performers were good. My 8 year old son enjoyed the show. The only pros that I have that the price was too expensive for the location it was used for the show : old movie theatre that was a cheap , poor place not in a nice neighborhood .",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "I have gone to Tri for about 4 years now for my nails and love him and his staff. Everyone is so friendly and are good at what they do. He always makes an effort to fit me into his schedule even tho I am very last minute! He does a great job and genuinely cares if u are happy with your service. I have referred many friends to him and they all feel the same. Bottom line is u won't have a bad experience if u go to creative salon",
        "The first time couple of times I went there they were closer to four stars, but this last trip put them at a three star. The combo Kung pao was just average. I really hate meat that is mushy, and that's what the beef was. This is just your average Chinese joint with a nice decor.",
        "Call it sushi ugh!!! Went there on Monday \\\"all-you-can eat\\\". NOT worth it. 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered. 2nd, the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit!!! There was only one sushi chef. We had to wait for our order as there were more people. Not worth your money. BEWARE!!!",
        "A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills.",
        "I like the suite at Mandalay Bay its 750 sq the service at the front desk are always friendly, But I dislike it when my room were comp and they still charge me if I didn't look at my credit card the same week I wouldn't catch it that they charge me for 2 nights when those 2 nights are suppose to be free.",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "I had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant.",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "Stopped in here just for the 5.00 Nathans hot dog, draw and chips. They have a condiment bar with about 30 toppings for the dogs. \\n\\nThe place itself it fairly nice, kind of a old school pub feel (lots of carved wood and nice couch/lounge areas.",
        "The only thing this place loves is high prices. They clearly hate burgers. Food was greasy, cold and not worth even finishing. I hope this place closes sooner than later, there are way too many restaurants in Las Vegas that are overpriced and substandard that stay open because they rely on non repeat tourist business.",
        "smoky and old inside...not really a fan",
        "Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor.",
        "The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days."

My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "Wasn't to impressed with there bacon & cheddar sandwich. The bacon was cold,eggs were mediocre,cheese tastes nasty. I asked them to toast it,they didn't. It tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. The only thing that was good was the asiago bagel.",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "Crazy lines, but good thing we have VIP passes to skip the madness.\\n\\nEvery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit! How can a girl in heels survive?\\n\\nGreat music though.",

Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",

        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",

        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.",
        "Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. \\n\\nThe pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. \\n\\nThe one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review!

I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",

        "Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",

I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.

        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",

        "This place is pretty lively when we went. The atmosphere gave me a Dallas's vibe. The food was good. I had a chicken cesar salad. My friend got some shrimp pasta dish, that was pretty good. Must try their brownie. It's freshly made with your choice of ice cream on top. It's very good, but only when it is hot. When it gets cold, it won't taste as good. So eat it fast.",

Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "We live close by and couldn't wait for this place to open! Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. \\nAlthough service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery...

        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "WOW! that pretty much could be all that needs to be said for this review, but that would be lame! \\nZumanity A+. I have seen this show once before and i was blown away then. This time even knowing what to expect, STILL blown away.\\nThis show is for the dirty minded only! =) The show is done in good taste, not like a straight out strip show. The comedy in the pre-show and throughout is just the best.",

        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat",

        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",
        "For a \\\"clean\\\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \\\"grilled\\\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again.",
        "This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!",
        "Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",

        "If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff. \\n\\nThe food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty.",
        "Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  \\nThe Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.",
        "The food tasted great, but my burger was more of a meatball than a patty. Eating it was a physical challenge which was a shame because it was so good when it finally engaged my taste buds. The service was so-so. I felt like the place was trying so hard to be hip that it was going to have an seizure. The details about it being very loud are not kidding. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet place to chat.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things.",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "The Sunset Caf\\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff.",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",
        "Its good yogurt to get your sugar fix but its not the best that i have tasted. I love how it looks inside though and the name is quite cute!",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "Its been over a year since I had Chili's. I had a taste for some ribs and it really hit the spot.",
        "I went here a couple of months ago because my cousin recommend this place. I don't think I will be back here again! I did get my eyebrows waxed here and the lady didn't do a good job.\\n\\nThe place is clean, staff is friendly but they do try to upsell some of their products.",
        "I have been coming to this location since it opened years ago and the only thing I can really complain about is the green tea latte.  Most times it's good but twice I have gotten it with the Matcha powder clumped in the bottom and clogging the straw. Not much grosser than drinking your tea and getting clumps of powder ever few seconds. Other than that, they are quick and its always clean.",
        "The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there.",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",
        "The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill",
        "If you like clean beds and helpful staff then this is the place, I just moved to Henderson I use to go to the one on Maryland parkway and I love this one better, helpful staff and NO Waiting for a bed!\\nIt's recommended you make an appointment to get he bed you want but you are in and out in no time",
        "Spacious & clean .\\nNo refrigerator or safe on the room.\\nDid not loose anything though .\\nBring your swimwear with you . The pool is OK and fairly large . 4 people could do lapses with a bit of maneuvering .",
        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.\\nMade a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.\\nStaff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean.",
        "Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better.",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Price - reasonable range\\nService - prompt and friendly \\nAtmosphere - parking kind of hard but has a nice outdoor area . Overall neat and hip\\nFood - flavorful :) pretty decent overall.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",
        "awesome lanes, always busy, always clean... I think the cashier could be happier but hey, its a bowling alley.",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark."

The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business.

After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating.

        "Cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland. Store bought chips for the dips. Kids Mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless. Chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned. Heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza. Salt is great resource. Thanks but no thanks not again",
        "This place used to be a great inexpensive dive to grab a bite with friends. They got rid of table service, so now you must order food and drinks at a counter. What little staff that are still there seem to be inexperienced and nervous. Food quality has gone down yet their prices have gone up ruffly 35 percent. You are now paying Kabuki prices for no service, blah food quality, and a busted up environment. It's a real shame that this place fell apart.",
        "Fun neighborhood place with good basic bar grub.",
        "Great meal. Tom yum soup hits the spot on a cool day. \\nLast couple trips here it seems the soup and entrees come out very close to each other. I would prefer to eat the soup before the entree arrives. \\nBut a solid meal everytime.",
        "Excellent sushi, great service, and good happy hour specials.  It has a decent sports bar theme.  I had my bachelor party here and even my friends who don't care for fish liked the place.  I also go here for business dinners.\\n\\nTry the Ladybug Roll just for the presentation.",
        "Very impressed!  Learned a lot about how I run and which type of shoes will help my feet stay happy.  Very friendly and great customer service, also priced well!  Nice couple who are runners own the store, so go there and support a local small business!",
        "I'm not going to rehash what's been stated hear a billion times, this place is solid.\\n\\nBut due try to get a Sunday brunch reservation about a month in advance, the brunch menu is unique and unbelievable.  Skip the bloody mary bar and just get something off of the menu.",
        "This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",
        "Sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow.  I ordered 3 rolls, it took 20 minutes to get the first one, and they served them one at a time. It wasn't crowded, I was the only one at the sushi bar.   Go to Ginbu 401 instead.",
        "Hotel rooms are pretty gross. Carpets are so dirty that our feet got black. When we first checked in, there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows. GROSS. I guess you can say that you get what you pay for.. Cheap hotel. At least there was a mini fridge.\\n\\nBuffet was awesome though!",
        "Really, really heavy food.  I like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals.  An experience, undoubtably, but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals.  A salad on the menu would be nice.\\n\\nThat said, the service was spectacularly good.",
        "Just getting back on a bike after many, many years. Great to have a bike shop that takes the time to answer questions and give advice because they want you to do it right. Did not buy my bike from them but they treated me as if I had. Great service and rider support.",
        "Bad! Local produce? Try spoiled produce! Appalled by the lack of freshness! Vegetables were past their prime. We left hungry. So disapointed, we wanted to support a local business, but this was so bad! All the good reviews are lies!",
        "Didn't live up to the hype.  My steak was OK, but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone.  We tried the arugula salad, heirloom tomatoes, asparagus along with the filet and chicken.  Steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "Maybe I just don't get it. It's a tall, bright, clean store. It's a fancy store. But it's not at all what I expected of a Harvey Nichols. Even though I was just in for a wander (as the store carries very little in the way of things in my budget or size), I was underwhelmed.",
        "Sabas Mediterranean is a great little restaurant for date night or family night. The staff is always friendly and can answer any question you might have. \\n\\nThey also have a great $5 gyro happy hour! Which is an awesome deal because the gyros are very tasteful.  I also really like the falafel.",

        "If give them zero stars but it won't let me. They charge you a deduct able on all repairs and even though something is installed in your house before you ever looked at it they make you handle replacing the unit claiming non partisan on the major appliance. Don't advertise something and not support it. Double standard political garbage should be removed from Vegas.",
        "Their lamb entree was great but they have removed it from the dinner entree selections. If you want to try it, you have to order the chef tasting option which costs a lot more. The lamb taco and seabass were not bad but I have had better else where. Over all i thought this place is over priced and the food was just ok. I was not impressed with this restaurant.",

Without fail when shopping there isn't a time that at least one item I'm looking for is always out of stock.",

I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",

I guess some guys get together every Monday to jam- we left before they started but it was a very friendly environment.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.  I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.    If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!",
        "Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar.",
        "I have been coming to this location since it opened years ago and the only thing I can really complain about is the green tea latte.  Most times it's good but twice I have gotten it with the Matcha powder clumped in the bottom and clogging the straw. Not much grosser than drinking your tea and getting clumps of powder ever few seconds. Other than that, they are quick and its always clean.",
        "The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there.",
        "Super fast delivery, and really nice delivery guy.\\n\\nThe delivery portions were tiny for $11, and the pepper chicken was ridiculously spicy, and this is coming from someone who puts black pepper on everything. If you're going to add that much black pepper, balance it out with some lemon or lime, unless you like a mouthful of fire. The crispy spinach was good and sweet though.",
        "This is the best \\\"East Coast Style\\\" Chinese food I have found in the area, and believe me, I have tried several. Wonton soup is fantastic. A large feeds 3 people. There's 10 wonton in a large. The sweet and sour pork is amazeballs. My bf tried the beef lo mein. He loved it. Mmmm, can't wait to go back again.",
        "I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",
        "Went for dinner last night, they have closed.  Don't know if it's just a remodel or whether they are out of here...",
        "It wasn't horrible. The girl seemed like she couldn't be bothered and wanted to be else were. The guy was trying to be impressive with all his different topics. He was be over bearing and ignoying  to me. I wasn't  impressed by his conversations.\\n\\nThey job they did was standard.",
        "Ice tea is awful!  Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant!  Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service.",
        "Not a fan of the layout. The dance floor is extremely small. To get to the restrooms, you have to get through the dance floor, which is pretty much impossible when it's jam packed with bodies. Our promoter got the girls in for free and guys at $12 cover. Also not a bad deal that from 11-midnight, it was open bar for ladies.",
        "Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price"

        "We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks. I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot. Order it! So delicious!\\n\\nNeed to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome.",
        "Industrial chic, great people, almost like having dinner at a friends house, only better. Great food! Amazing really. They use local and fresh ingredients. The menu is always changing.  The wine list is nice, and the craft cocktails have won me over... Especially that good \\\"Bourbon Lemonade.\\\" oh and the brunch is so good! The croque madam with a mango bloody Mary changed my life.",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "One of the more crowded and more popular places on Mill, but sometimes it will take 10-15 min to get a drink. Fun place to play some pool and have a few drinks. The long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few. Overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars.",
        "One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "Great place to have a beer or have anything from their great menu. The bar and sitting area is as hip and rustic as it gets. Very friendly staff and all around a good place to be a usual hang-out place.",
        "Wasn't to impressed with there bacon & cheddar sandwich. The bacon was cold,eggs were mediocre,cheese tastes nasty. I asked them to toast it,they didn't. It tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. The only thing that was good was the asiago bagel.",
        "Really good Ahi Tuna steak, especially if you're drunk and need something to even out the alcohol. Servers are nice and quick.",
        "This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.",
        "Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \\n\\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \\n\\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!",
        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "Great service!  Food tasted great too.",
        "The only thing irish about this \\\"irish pub\\\" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring.",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "Never had a bad drink from this store. The drive thru can get a little long, but it's worth the wait.",
        "Small portions & expensive. Waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu or drinks. My specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it... It didn't. Lasagna was tiny.. Pizza was okay. I didn't mind it.. Nothing special tho.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!",
        "The boba drink was terrible, but the shaved ice was good.",
        "Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.",
        "Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no\\nEVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses",
        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",
        "Had my first Short Leash Dog at the food Truck Friday a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)",
        "Probably the worst chinese I've had in years. Sweet and sour had almost no sauce, and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew, not spicy at all. Not worth half what I paid.",
        "see the waitress?  see her ignore you?  see a bartender ?  good luck if you can find one...maybe they are hiding somewhere?  big points on the art and decor, the music is usually stellar, but the service is really lacking.  there is a really good selection of beer, somewhat pricey.  the hummus is really good.  oh but why is the Indian serving the naked goddess on the painting above the bar?  that will have you stumped for hours!",
        "I'm kinda at a lost for words because I like how the place is set up and in the beginning when you come here they make you feel happy but after you order your first round they seem to not care about serving you anymore..you literally have to call them or you never get in your second order or drink refills...you guys have some work to do..ive tried this place twice so its not because they were busy or the server..",
        "Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\\n\\n\\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00.",
        "This place is great-only thing was we couldn't get a table in the outside patio!! It was a Friday night though-still had a great time. Get there early on weekends to get a good seat. Great local and non-local spot. excellent beer choices. don't plan on eating.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",
        "Good food. They sell kids meal that is just right for me. It includes a slider (which is pretty much a full sized burger) , French fries (fresh and generous portion) and drink, for like 6 bucks. This is my favorite airport food actually. The bar next to it is a good place to hangout for a beer when waiting for your next flight.",
        "Hint: reservation a must\\nCrowded; great value for all-you-eat-pasta; small $ supplement for sausage, meatballs, chicken\\nFriendly & cool food service by Linzy\\nNice small dessert sampler\\nDelish pumpkin cheese cake\\nWine & beer",
        "Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "They are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color. The polish looks really bad, the impurities in the crappy polish are showing. Not recommended.",
        "Great place, with a small, personal atmosphere. The service is amazing, and the beer choices are great. A lot of imported beer selection on tap. Good place for great conversation.",
        "Tried with a Groupon. Suprised to be allowed to use multiple Groupons in one visit.  However, not allowed to purchase any specials with the Groupons (e.g half price chicken fingers).  Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order \\\"venti iced stirred caramel macchiato\\\" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed \\\"not stirred\\\" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer",
        "The rude staff I have meet... First it took them a minutes to sit me and my son. After being seated.. My son and I waiting over 20 minutes NO DRINK NO SERVICE... The whole time I am just looking around eating to be service.. And NO THEY WAS NOT BUSINESS AT ALL! BS",
        "Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back.",
        "Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \\n\\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "I don't like giving 5's, so a 4, nice to have a Guinness, and a Guinness stew. Wife had a Sheppard's pie and was happy. Should use real mash potatoes. Servings on the large size. The fish and chips could help feed the 5000. For Vegas not bad value. Good selection of beers.",
        "If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff. \\n\\nThe food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty.",
        "The food tasted great, but my burger was more of a meatball than a patty. Eating it was a physical challenge which was a shame because it was so good when it finally engaged my taste buds. The service was so-so. I felt like the place was trying so hard to be hip that it was going to have an seizure. The details about it being very loud are not kidding. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet place to chat.",
        "The bartending staff at Irish wolfhound is always working hard to make sure everyone feels welcome. especially after a long day at my restaurant it feels nice to come in and be recognized because they always know our names and what we usually drink it feels like our version of cheers. Dirty bird forever! !!!!",
        "It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",
        "Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)",

        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.

        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good.",
        "My husband and I stopped  at Sugar & Ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am.  The food and drink were a little pricey, but good.  I had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall.  It was relaxing, and a great way start off the morning.",
        "I don't understand why the bar/snack register does not have the candy readily available or on display. The bartender had to leave her station to walk halfway across the theater to get our order making us late for the movie. Then it was quite warm inside the theater, enough to make me uncomfortable throughout the movie.",
        "I have been coming to this location since it opened years ago and the only thing I can really complain about is the green tea latte.

Not much grosser than drinking your tea and getting clumps of powder ever few seconds. Other than that, they are quick and its always clean.",
        "They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower.",
        "This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!",

        "This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!",
        "I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",
        "this has been my place to go EVERY single time i am in vegas. the bartender (not sure if he is there anymore) is why i go there seriously, he is the best bartender i have come across in all my trips to vegas. when im craving that blue cheese burger and a good beer i go here. shout out to D! hope to see you soon!",
        "Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \\nIt wasn't horrible.",
        "If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of.  And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass.  Wtf!?  This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus?  Will not be coming back.  Get it together .",
        "I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill",
        "Great place to watch sports as there are plenty of tv's, a great beer selection, but wished the food was better. It is not that the food is bad it is just so heavy and rich. If you eat an entire burger, you will be full for 2 days... Usually end up making what we call the \\\" hell fire nachos\\\" which is basically their hell fire chips covered with the buffalo chicken spread.",
        "Average beer... Great food.",
        "Good value. It's an older property but decent place and price was right at 180/night during peak season. Great atmosphere on the patio to enjoy a drink or meal. Beds were actually pretty good for an older place, they are definitely newer. Convenient location right off the freeway and tucked into the side of the mountain. Didn't get out for golf but played there before and remember it being good bit great. It's not Scottsdale but it's a great value.",
        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "If you are looking for beer....stop by the pub!  The Pub has a ENORMOUS beer menu.  We didn't stop in for food, so I can't give any reviews about the grub.",
        "Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \\\"grunge\\\" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",
        "A gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town.  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather, and cute cafe tables on the inside.  We had no wait even over the Xmas/New years holiday at prime lunch hour.\\n\\nExcellent service, very tasty lunch fare, and reasonable prices.\\n\\nI would definitely return here, and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well.",
        "good selction of beer, but the service was blah.  food was not great, but sort of expect if from a more bar setting.  someone put a lot of money into the place, but they should care a bit more about what they put out now...",
        "Great for walking around in, The Prices are expensive for everything from Alcohol to Gelato to Watches and Various items. But it is the Forum shops and makes for a great time none the less to get out of the Hot Vegas Sun and look at things you may never afford or would want if you could afford it. Lots of good restaurants inside as well. Which range from reasonable to Take out a Second Mortgage on the house.",
        "I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Ordered the Siete Mares and it is out of sight!  If I were ordering this anywhere in Scottsdale it would have cost triple what they charge.  5 blue mussels, 5 clams, several large shrimp.  Spicy, served on a bed of angel hair pasta with Texas toast to die for.  Oh, and did I mention their  beer menu is awesome...",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)"

Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \\n\\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!",

        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "Came here with friends for a birthday dessert. Quaint atmosphere with very attentive staff. Tried the Strawberry Kiss, Chocolate Brownie, and profiteroles. Hella good.",
        "Small portions & expensive. Waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu or drinks. My specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it... It didn't. Lasagna was tiny.. Pizza was okay. I didn't mind it.. Nothing special tho.",

        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",

        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",

Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive. \\n\\nFood came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large. \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait.",

        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty.

        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",

        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "I was very disappointed in the food. Portions were quite small and monochromatic in tasty. We had to ask for bread. The dessert was very dry. All around skimpiness and not worth the money. There are many restaurants for tha same money around.",
        "Disappointing :( I drove way out of my way to come here and it's was just whatever. I have high standards for food and this was far below what I was hoping for. I tried 5 diff things and after one bite I threw it out. It wasn't bad, just didn't put a smile on my face or interest me to come back",
        "Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.",

        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus.",
        "We live close by and couldn't wait for this place to open! Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. \\nAlthough service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery... Overall poor quality or just old food! \\nToo bad because this place looks nice and clean but they just need new cooks and recipes??!",
        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "Great food. Kind of pricy for the portions but it is great food!! Makes you feel good about what you are eating!!",
        "Tradional american food, the service was good Our waiter was very friendly, the food came out pretty quick.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, I had the strawberry basil mojito very good.  Sometimes they have live music there , theres a nice outside area to eat where you can enjoy the fountain.  Theres a gift shop in the front of the restaurant where you can shop all the hard rock mercandise.",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!",
        "Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\\u00e9s. Portions g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre.",
        "Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "We are locals, and this is the only buffet we will go to.  We like that they have small portions, so we are able to take a little of everything.  Very good food.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "Super fast delivery, and really nice delivery guy.\\n\\nThe delivery portions were tiny for $11, and the pepper chicken was ridiculously spicy, and this is coming from someone who puts black pepper on everything. If you're going to add that much black pepper, balance it out with some lemon or lime, unless you like a mouthful of fire. The crispy spinach was good and sweet though.",
        "They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower.",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers.",
        "Two words- cheap, good. Lunch specials are very affordable and the portions aren't too bad. So many noodle, rice and a la carte dishes to choose from. To be honest the quality is better than Sam Woo's. Come here for lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed!",
        "Generous portions and good food.  I appreciatef the choice of black beans in addition to refried beans.",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "This place is the real deal.  The pho here has really deep developed flavors.  Good sized portions & good prices.",
        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "Verdict: Good before, but \\\"meh\\\" now. \\n\\nThis place was pretty good and always gave us exactly what we ordered, but now they give us half the portions of what we used to get. \\n\\nI don't know if maybe they recently changed owners, but we won't be coming back here anymore.",
        "I did not like this ice cream. I had a few bites - threw it away. Didn't have the flavor/texture of the real deal. It looked like ice cream, had all the proper attributes of ice cream... but it wasn't. Maybe its an Asian take on what we know as ice cream? Me no likey.",
        "Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!",
        "Great and friendly atmosphere. Seasonal and regional menu; very accommodating.\\nOpen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I got to meet the 2 owners; brothers, who are very friendly. Menu changes 8 times a year. With time, this will easily be 5 stars.",
        "Very lame portions at this location. It's almost as if they have a game going on how little they can put into bowl... Very disappointed! Totally killed my experience at this entire chain...",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",
        "Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \\n\\nNo happy hour menu. \\n\\n\\\"Communal bar table\\\" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\\n\\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return.",
        "We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.",
        "The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!",
        "The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \\n\\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return.",
        "Amazing Mexican restaurant! Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drink just WOW! So glad i discovered this gem. There dips are great, i had the enchilladas and there mojitos are great to beat the Vegas heat.\\nWill definately go back next time i am in Vegas.",
        "Lovely, little place in a cool strip mall filled with neat businesses. Two medium sized portions were $10.82. My almond and bacio (hazelnut chocolate) was delish and filled with nuts. The almond tasted like almond butter but so much better; no extract here. Boyfriend had lemon gelato and sorbet, enjoyed both, finished his way faster than I finished mine. Clean, neat operation with pleasant employees.",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "We got take out here. I had the orange chicken which was pretty good. The fried rice looked like white rice with some soy sauce. No veggies and only a few pieces of egg- pretty disappointing (maybe I ordered wrong) but overall taste was good. My husband had egg drop soup and general tso's chicken. He enjoyed his meal. We will be back here - just probably won't get the fried rice again.",
        "Nope. This is overpriced nonsense. I hate to start out the review with a statement so crass, but truly, its location allows this establishment to charge a great deal of money for a meal that is not really that good. Once you get past the pot of liquid and the skewer, think about what you're eating, and then look at the bill. These things do NOT add up.",
        "The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back.",
        "I had a bul-gogi burrito with a chicken fusion taco. Everything was amazing. The thinly sliced beef was absolutely delicious. Loved the chicken on the fresh corn tortillas. i was also served complimentary chips and salsa and guac, which was awesome and unexpected. I all this... plus a bottle of water for 6.48. Unreal. Go here. You will not be disappointed.",
        "We love Golden Harvest! HUGE delicious portions make busy nights easy. Friendly staff. We've been coming for years and will continue.",
        "Nope. Went for dinner tonight. The place was dirty. The sushi was very poor quality and now my husband has food poisoning. The sushi was on par with what you buy from a grocery store. Oh and there was a hair on our menu. Gross. Go to Yen's!",
        "Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas. We really enjoy the beet selection of my favorite beers was the Fullers ESB it's English and went perfectly with my meal. We were one very happy couple and will be returning soon .",
        "Corn muffins were amazing and good service but nothing noteworthy here. I have traveled extensively throughout the south and always try to seek out new BBQ. Pork and ribs were good but not special. Sauces were unique but not something I wanted the recipe for. Sides were disappointing, green beans, mashed potatoes and barbecue beans in particular. Everything was over salted.",
        "One helluva view and fantastic jalape\\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!",
        "Expensive, glorified bar food and crappy server. The view was great though, right across the Bellagio fountains. Be fair warned, food is mediocre. They need to really fix this place up. How disappointing.",
        "Chicken fried steak and eggs rocks!!!!!!!  Service was excellent. Very attentive. Portions were big and prices were fair. Location was easily accessible with plenty of parking. Restaurant was clean and coffee delicious. We loved it. Great weekend breakfast spot.",

        "Disappointing.  After reading the positive reviews,  we gave Vida a try for dinner.  I agree with another reviewer that it was subpar.  Better choices are out there",
        "I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",
        "I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \\n\\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again.",
        "Warning: The chocolate brownie cookies must be loaded with crack, because they are extremely addictive. Broccoli cheese soup is phenomenal, and the sandwich (Italian) was good as well. 10/10 would eat again, and again, and again.",
        "I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back.",
        "I've been here a few times and the place is great! Huge portions, reasonably priced and tastes very authentic! I will definitely be coming back.",
        "Love Chick-fil-A! Been a Raving Fan for almost 6 years. When it comes to customer service and atmosphere, it just doesn't get any better than Chick-fil-A. It's more than just a transaction, it's an experience. Great family environment and healthy choices.",
        "I live just north of the Burger Factory, its always busy.  The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.  \\n\\nThe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite.",
        "I went around 2:30 am the other day and tried their cookies for the first time. I am still thinking about it...enough for me to write a review at 1:30 am. Try their white chocolate macadamia sooooo good, the chocolate chunk, not so much.",
        "I had to give it the four stars because my wife loved her curry and I thoroughly enjoyed mine. I had the mango chicken curry and my wife had the pineapple chicken curry and both were well balanced in flavor. The sweetness from the fruit was perfectly offset by the spiciness and the coconut cream gave the curry a great texture. We also ordered the 'fresh rolls' aka spring rolls and they were good but nothing out of the norm. The young waiter was very polite and prompt.",
        "Pretty good prices on their happy hour.  The best deal is their 1/2 lb burger with fries for $3.  They also have garlic wine mussels for $4 which are decent, although the broth isn't as flavorful as other McCormick and Schmick's I've been to.  Other items that aren't as good are the tuna tostadas and the fish tacos.",
        "I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.",
        "Horrible service but the food is good. I went to the Zipps on camelback all the time and was so excited when this one opened up in Glendale. Other than the food this is NOT the same restaurant. I always order my food to go to avoid the horrible management restaurant chain atmosphere and poor service. Disappointing.",
        "If you are looking for the freshest seafood in town, this is the best place to go. The portions are perfect, where you are satisfied but not overwhelmingly stuffed. The food feels more organic and clean in that I feel they use simple ingredients and don't try to add to many \\\"fillers\\\" for taste. If I was to pick anywhere in Birmingham to impress someone, this would be my choice.",
        "Stopped by with my son after the zoo.  Clean, friendly and the food was good.  Portions are quite large, so definitely a great value for the price.  We will return.",
        "I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.",
        "Disappointing. Color was not done well. Thus expensive for the results.   \\nGray was not covered. Friendly. Clean",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "Atmosphere: B  (no music so created a abort of akward silence at times)\\n\\nService: A - very attentive and helpful\\n\\nFood: delicious!\\n\\nPrice: B (a bit high for portions but not a deal breaker)",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",
        "Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out."

        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",

        "I will echo the comments of everyone else. This was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park, although it technically is a fountain. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area it's worth the stop.",
        "This guy Gerry is as good as it gets, he wont rip you off, and his work stands the test of time, at least with the two vessels he has repaired for us. He's pretty quick and very knowledgable , very fair with his pricing as well. So as long as we have boats we'll be using Gerry when we need major repairs.",
        "This place is sensational. Went her about 7-8 times in our 10 day stay in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills. Just couldn't get enough. Food and variety of is great, terrific decor and friendly service. A restaurant that really has it all together. Red Sangria best I've ever had.",
        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "Decent venue, well run, drinks are about what you'd expect. Overall you need to go when there is a good DJ, we had some second rate DJs who aren't local, but aren't good. It was a fun time, but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it.",

Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.

The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug",

        "Lucky Cup is typical Froyo place.   Bright and with 12 flavors and lots of the usual toppings.  They did have a few fresh fruit toppings.  The yogurt favors I sampled were a bit off and bitter.   The one worker on duty didn't seem to want to communicate with us or answer any questions.",
        "I come here all the time with my son who loves the chicken tenders.  Food is 'OK' although my favorite is the BK stacker which seems to have gotten smaller and smaller over the past few years and the price is probably higher.

They got a driver there in less than 30 minutes and I was able to get a ride to work and be there on time. They took my car to a shop by my house and only charged me $65. I'm so grateful for their help. They made a stressful situation much easier on me.",

I am never disappointed by the quality of the hand-made noodles and sauces that come along with all of the variation. One thing I have noticed over the numerous times I've been there is that their soup dumplings have become smaller and smaller in size. The flavor of the soup dumplings is very similar to my favorite soup dumpling restaurant in Asia so I highly recommend this place!",

        "If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff. \\n\\nThe food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty.",
        "This is one of the best burger places in town! If you love burgers and Asian inspired dishes...This is your place. They take your typical American burger and kick it up a notch with great asian flavor. On top of that, they always have great service!",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "The bartending staff at Irish wolfhound is always working hard to make sure everyone feels welcome. especially after a long day at my restaurant it feels nice to come in and be recognized because they always know our names and what we usually drink it feels like our version of cheers. Dirty bird forever! !!!!",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there.",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",
        "I don't typically like Asian cuisine but When I came here I had the shrimp pho, It was so delicious! If you like spicy and seafood, this is your dish. And service here is friendly and I love the decor, it's so cute.",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "I saw the show in Sacramento, CA and overall I liked it. All jokes, tricks was understandable as I am from Europe. I felt as I was back to my childhood . Animals and performers were good. My 8 year old son enjoyed the show. The only pros that I have that the price was too expensive for the location it was used for the show : old movie theatre that was a cheap , poor place not in a nice neighborhood .",
        "I did not like this ice cream. I had a few bites - threw it away. Didn't have the flavor/texture of the real deal. It looked like ice cream, had all the proper attributes of ice cream... but it wasn't. Maybe its an Asian take on what we know as ice cream? Me no likey.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)",
        "Everything is over-sweet. No resemblance of real Asian food.",
        "I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though.",
        "My husband and I attended Chef Alyssa's Dressed Up Game Day class in September. What a cool venue and a very fun date night! We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed meeting the other members of our kitchen team that night. We have already made the sweet potato wedges twice  since the class and are looking forward to making the baked wings (SO GOOD!) soon. We are looking forward to booking another class soon- maybe with some friends this time.",
        "Two thumbs up! I am not a big sandwich person but I have to say this place serves really good sandwiches and salads. The bread is fresh and just tastes great. Service is efficient even though it is always packed and there's always a line. Would definitely go back next time I have a craving for the Full Montagu.",
        "So far my favorite place I have eaten in Vegas. Cozy, casual, & clean environment with an eclectic menu. Grand Luxe offers a menu that is fresh & affordable that will even satisfy a wide range of tastes. The service has always been fast & efficient when I have dined here & I am looking forward to eating here later this week.",
        "I honestly had a completely different experience here than the past visitors. \\n\\nI found the Diagnostic center when I was searching for a new Primary Care Dr. that accepted Culinary Insurance. I was very pleased to find Dr. Hess is currently accepting new patients. \\n\\nI found the staff incredibly friendly and educated. They were all dressed very casually which was nice because it made you forget you are at the Doctor. \\n\\nI am thrilled to have found a new doctor!",
        "Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.",
        "Super speedy online ordering and they come to your house so quick! Can't beat that. Hey it's Chinese food, not rocket science. It gets the job done for those awesome cravings. I am not a frequent diner at Chinese food restaurants, but all I know is that this tastes great and is delivered fast for my lazy days. Can't beat that.",
        "Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \\\"afterparty\\\" but I would rather stick to the main clubs.",
        "Magpie is a great little Pizzeria located on MaGuire just above fairmount\\n\\nTo begin their MagPie Bloody Caesar is amazing\\nI started with their meatballs and Caesar Salad, again both were really good\\n\\nTheir Pizzas are HUGE 1 is enough for 2 people, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, I had Prosciutto it was delicious\\n\\nPrices are reasonable but space is limited so get there early or make reservations",
        "I love this place but be careful you WILL overeat! Also, making reservations is better than not! And eat the meat and not the salad bar or you won't get your money's worth!",
        "Food was absolutely delicious,  but pricey. We were dressed in comfortable clothing (jeans/shorts/sweatshirts) and clearly did not fit in; this is a dressy crowd. We were also the youngest people there... it was mostly older adults 65+. Great views and good service.",
        "Tiffany is so wonderful I can't tell you enough that you need to go get your hair done by her and her team. You will love the color, cut and price. She is a miracle worker!\\n\\nI have been getting my hair done since 2008 by Tiffany and have not had one time where I get compliments the second I walk out the door.\\n\\nBook today!",
        "This place was nice at the casino not to many people however, some of the workers were rude. The place after late hours on the strip was not a safe feeling environment and one part of the place where the food places were had nothing but homeless and smelled bad. Not a place I would recommend for someone to stay at. Advice; keep for a last resort.",
        "One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.",
        "Normally I'm a cool headed person but when you manage to mess up two flights and then proceed to lose my carrying you insisted needed to go under the plane. I think I have a fair reason to be upset. I understand things happen but when I have been in three cities and each person I tried to speak with was incompetent and unable to get anything done I tend to get a little upset. Sorry but you have officially lost my business forever.",
        "I've been here a few times and the place is great! Huge portions, reasonably priced and tastes very authentic! I will definitely be coming back.",
        "I went back to Rancho De Tia Rosa on May 8, 2008 -- It's still ok, but not bad for the area.  I'll stick to the original Rosa's out on University.\\n\\nThis will be the place for meeting my friends who live on that side of town.",
        "I live just north of the Burger Factory, its always busy.  The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.  \\n\\nThe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite.",
        "Food is average, especially for the price. Small quantity too. Service not terrible, I wasn't done with my soup and the girl just took it away without saying anything!!! Go somewhere else if you want to have nice Asian food. You won't find it at Sato & Chan.",
        "The best show in vegas, period.  Terry has more talent in his pinky than most performers have in their entire bodies.   He has so much charisma, and humility it's amazing to see.  I took my wife and mother in law to see the show, and we were grins throughout the entire performance.\\n\\nWould highly recommend to anyone who is willing to let go and have a good time.",
        "The food here is very fresh and very thai.  I really enjoyed the red curry with chicken -you need to try!  Ive eaten Thai at other places in Pittsburgh (and there are really no good asian restaurants in pittsburgh anyway), and this is THE place for Thai.",
        "this place was ok, live music patio bar, the inside \\\"where the live music was being played\\\" smelled like chese/raunchy/idfk but it was not hot..\\n\\n\\ndrink specials were ok. havent had the food yet.... too smelly to eat inside..",
        "The food here is great, wonderful american-asian infusion.",
        "Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in.",
        "This is a nice little pizza place, one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil. The cheese on the knots didn't really stick well, but it was all pretty good as well.",
        "Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated",
        "I imagine at least a solid 60% of people who are trying to catch morning or afternoon flights out of here are hung over. \\n\\nWho thought it was a good idea to make this the loudest, brightest airport in the country?",
        "Worst service. \\nThe host was to personal. \\nMy silverware was dirty and had food on it.\\nDon't think this place is safe to eat.\\nThe waitress was not friendly and didn't explain the specials they offer. The waitress took 8 minutes for our drinks and they weren't even busy. The food came out warm not hot. She took a 30 minutes to bring the food. I think all their locations have gone down hill.",
        "I've been before and the food is okay. Today however I'm reviewing the service. After seating at the bar patiently waiting for service I decided to leave after the bartender did not acknowledge my presence and went on to serve guest that arrived after me. The host at the door were no better and very unpleasant.",
        "Uncomfortable beds, tiny cramped rooms, and too far away from everything. I guess you can't beat the price, though - hence the two stars. And the tourists are great to hustle at the poker table. Oh, and the blackjack dealers are all scantily dressed and dolled up - so that's a plus if you like that sort of stuff.",
        "No, it's not MGM or Mandalay Bay. It is a good buffet for the money. The lunch buffet had a lot of good options. They have Middle Eastern, Asian, Mexican, Italian and American standards. For $35 you can get three buffets in a day. I wouldn't suggest it, but you could!",
        "Called for the House Special Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Both sucked. I could feel the crunch of MSG on both. BBQ pork had no flavor (zero). House Special Fried Rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp. Nothing great about the ambience. Go only if you are craving for low grade asian food.",
        "A little snooty, but not a bad club at all. The dancers were super hot, bar service was pretty quick, amazing sound system, really overpriced drinks but someone's gotta pay for those bouncers and that awesome light setup. Horribly unorganized by the front but the bar and floor seemed well managed. Not sure if I'd ever go back but it was pretty legit.",
        "I've seen this show twice and would see it again when I go to Vegas next time!  Where else can you see a show where they built a theater just for this show?  I love looking around all the details of the theater.  This edited version really help move the show along and not let me loose interest.  I saw the movie version and went to sleep after 1 hour :(.",
        "The Downtown Dill is my favorite cocktail! This place is the most amazingly chill cocktail bar I've ever had the pleasure of being to. They have a number of great cocktails for you to expand your tastes with. I've never had a bad drink at DCR and I've pretty much tried most of the menu. The bartenders are also extremely friendly and personable!",
        "Worst indian food. Total waste of money. Lunch buffet is $12 with only small selection of food. Chicken is the worst I ever had. Sweet dish ( gulab jamun) very strange taste. I came with group of people, and was embarrassed to be the host. I am going back there unless they change the cook and increase selection.",
        "All this hype I heard about wicked spoon. Let me tell you, does not live up to the hype.  Prime rib felt like rubber.  Crab legs were cold.  Their version of ramen tasted undercooked and had the texture of playdoe.  I honestly think their sausage and dessert was the best thing there.  Would I go back? Probably not.",
        "I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place.  Everything about it was horrible.  The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever.  The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered.  The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.",
        "(+)s:\\nHidden in a random plaza, staff that only speaks Chinese, a view into the kitchen where you can watch the hand pulled noodles being prepared. Great prices for authentic chinese food. \\n\\nI've only been here once but the spicy noodles here are scrumptious. \\nIf I come back the next time and the food is still consistently delicious, this will definitely become a 5 star review",
        "This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly",
        "The burgers are good, but was really makes this place worth it are the shakes! You can get your standard shake with a variety of delicious flavors, or you can spice it up with alcoholic versions. Simply awesome.",
        "After being seated by a young host who mumbled something about drinks then walked off to never come back then sitting for over 10 minutes and being ignored by no less than 7 different servers who walked by us, we walked out. Since we've been here twice before and the food is always just average (extremely boring menu) don't think we'll be back. What a shame since there are not too many breweries on this side of town.",
        "I love having this place so close to home.  You can depend on them for all the basics when you're feeling a little Asian inspiration in the kitchen.\\n\\nI especially like the people who work there.  They're always friendly and will help you out if you can't find what you need.\\n\\nThe fresh produce/meat/fish components of this shop are a little . . . well, kinda dicey, but otherwise, thumbs up all the way.",
        "I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "The fries are the best.  This place just isn't as clean as it used to be, starting to look like a Chinese buffet. They have changed managers a lot since they opened.",
        "Lucky Cup is typical Froyo place.   Bright and with 12 flavors and lots of the usual toppings.  They did have a few fresh fruit toppings.  The yogurt favors I sampled were a bit off and bitter.   The one worker on duty didn't seem to want to communicate with us or answer any questions.",
        "What a store! I've never actually been in a Fry's until the other day and they have EVERYTHING! Books, music, video games, washing machines, tvs, everything. It's like the Walmart version of Best Buy.",
        "As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste.",
        "Always interesting things to see at Musee des Beaux Arts de Montreal. 2 huge pavilions spanning Sherbrooke St. with a variety of art (and art forms) for all tastes. \\n\\nThe problem is that IT IS NO LONGER FREE to access the permanent collection, unless you're under 30 years old. Bizarre. Those of us who are born too long ago have to pay to get in now. Be sure to check the site before going.. Recent change.",
        "Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix.",
        "Good food in a very relaxed atmosphere.  This is the place to have dinner if you are thinking asian and then heading over to hang at the Waverly or Cafe Olympico or maybe grabbing some good Scotch at Whisky Cafe.",
        "Worst service. Had reservations and was bring our child to celebrate her Bday.  Had to walk out after an hour of waiting.  Manager was passive and didn't care.  DO NOT GO HERE unless you have to do the touristy thing!",
        "Too bad I can't give a -5 star. We were told that we can't eat there because we both have to order from the same restraunt(24/7 cafe is where I usually eat at.). I rarely every want asian food. The wife loves it. So we were really mad at them. This is all very sad because last time we ate there we spent almost $80 on us. Oh well their loss.",
        "Famous chef, high expectations.  Few options on the menu but what you get is always good (and you expect the fewer the choices the closer to perfection...and you would be correct).  The service was good, the food was cooked to perfection (the salmon and even the chicken were moist and full of flavor).  You need reservations or you will be waiting a while (it's Vegas).  Pricy but worth it",
        "High prices, bad neighbourhood. Food tastes good. But with the money i spent, could of want to the buffet instead....",
        "Got a small taro snow with red bean and condensed milk and it was delicious. I thought it was actually pretty big for a small, but would be good for sharing. Also got a thai iced tea with boba. The boba has great consistency and tastes just right.",
        "This place as accommodated big parties and small get togethers with friends. The food is cheap but tastes great. Service has been very good",
        "Expensive drinks at $15 each, not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it. Interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes, etc which added some fun.",
        "Walked to Yogurtland  we saw the long line waiting in front of this ice cream parlor and, curiously, we decided to try it. Very distinctive and particular tastes, we tried the chocolate chip and it was really good. Certainly not the gelato we are used to the Italians, but definitely worth a taste.",
        "The overall experience was subpar. No greeting or direction on where to order when we entered. The burgers were cooked a little rarer than our tastes. The food in general was just average. Not much flavor. Smash Burger down the street is much better. And there's no need to make a comparison with 5 Guys. I don't see this place lasting long. The operation doesn't seem to be run smoothly either.",
        "Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\\n\\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\\n\\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too.",
        "Wow, never met a staff that would snap at you as much as this breakfast crew. Got sassed at by the host, snipped at by our waitress, and overheard a bit of a tiff with another. Not a great way to start the day.\\n\\nSeeing as I don't eat eggs, it was also a very limited breakfast menu for me. \\n\\nGot a muffin & coffee. Should've just gone to Starbucks.",
        "I would give this place 3.5 star rating if I could. Above average quality for buffet. Lots of choices, and even they had a lot of choices of asian food and dessert. Not worth the 1.5 hours waiting though, imo.",
        "Everything about this place seems to be a lesser version of a normal CPK: the menu is abbreviated, the pizza seems small, and the taste is missing. Prices however remain to be the same or higher than other franchise locations. Avoid this place if you can.",
        "I frequent Spokes about once a week with a group of friends. The place is great. Food is tasty. Staff is friendly. My only complaint is about the water. The water is terrible. It has a dirty taste to it. Their tea and lemonade also tastes that way. Everything else is good here.",
        "I've only had the Pad Thai so far, but it was excellent. They apparently have a Thai chef, so most the dishes have a Southeast Asian flair--which I love.\\n\\nI've heard that the Korean burritos are also excellent--fresh ingredients, tasty sauce.\\n\\nThe owner is wonderful and very eager to please the customers."

        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",

Exactly what you would expect this type of steakhouse. My coworkers who are a little bit older enjoyed it and were able to talk shop without all the vegas noise.",

Omelets are what I recommend for this place (who wouldn't have eggs at a place called 'The Good Egg' ??).\\n\\nPass on the pancakes.  Coffee could be improved.",
        "A leg of the Quiznos franchises decided to go their own way and become \\\"Dad's Deli\\\". This store is not one of them, it's still a Quiznos.

        "Waste of time to sell clothes.. Brought what they wanted.. A&F, gap, F21, Armani exchange, juicy, JBrand, Zara, etc.. Out of 2 garbage bags full of barely used name brand clothes they bought ONE sweater for a dollar and wanted to buy my Kooba bag for $5, which i paid around $700 for. However the staff is very friendly and a good place to shop if you have the time.",
        "Really oddly laid out. It spirals in on itself. But, it has great stores, especially the ABC Stores, they have all the casual snacks and stuff you'll need. There are some upscale stores and some really affordable ones. Since I'm not a high roller, I prefer this mall.",
        "This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.",
        "Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.",
        "Tradional american food, the service was good Our waiter was very friendly, the food came out pretty quick.

Theres a gift shop in the front of the restaurant where you can shop all the hard rock mercandise.",
        "Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.",
        "overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. \\nemployee came and reprimanded her.",
        "Do not go to the Sears on E Thomas Rd.  They missed two delivery dates, gave horrible customer service and were very rude. I finally gave up and cancelled my purchase of a washer and dryer. I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!",

        "Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  \\nThe Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.",

        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",
        "The food is good that's why we come here but we will be finding a new one to go to every time we come the staff is unprofessional messing around  yelling across the store to one another 2 different visits they were cursing one time they were complaining about another guest and they always have the same Spanish soap opera on the tv I thought this was a family friendly place",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",

        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "A very tight parking lot for this Walgreens and I would seriously recommend that you monitor your surroundings when you're going from the store to your car. It is a very tight parking lot.\\n\\nI didn't go in on this particular visit - we used the drive-through and had a great clerk taking care of our prescription. Top notch and just for her, she gets a star. Otherwise it would have been a one star visit.",
        "These stores are HUGE and there's never anyone in them. How they stay in biz is beyond me. Any who, there were plenty of workers around to try to help me find an anti-glare screen for my lappy 5000, but it turns out they do not sell this product anymore. Boo. Need a sharpie or a binder? Come here. Need anything beyond that? Call Amazon.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",
        "Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!",
        "The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!",
        "Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!",
        "Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!",
        "Very lame portions at this location. It's almost as if they have a game going on how little they can put into bowl... Very disappointed! Totally killed my experience at this entire chain...",
        "A Kohl's is a Kohl's is a Kohl's. I really don't have much to add here. I went to this store by chance has I needed to stock up on some warmer clothes. I was impressed with the sale that they had going on; on the same hand the selection was fairly limited.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and there was plenty of parking. I would not be opposed to going back.",
        "Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave",
        "Although when I did go it was busy making me wait a long time , I think this place has wonderful employees. Customer service is great. Although some people have very lil patience , the guys don't let any of that get to them .",
        "So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  \\n\\nThe store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.",
        "Second to Hurley's for good pub grub on lunch. Fish n Chips - with really tasty chips. Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office.",
        "I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(",
        "Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store",
        "I have NEVER had such a great experience ordering flowers. This is truly customer service at its highest level. Tony did a fantastic job helping me to order flowers for my girlfriend and at such last minute as well. NOT only did he provide excellent service, he made a special run to the grocery store to purchase an add-on item I wanted to send her. \\nWOW!! I am truly impressed with their great service and help.",
        "Good local sub shop.",
        "Wow, this place is fantastic!!!!\\n\\nIf you want more than just stores to look at while you're shopping, Caesar's is the place to be.  They have almost everything you're looking for, and the space is amazing.  \\n\\nI've even spotted a few celebrities while I was shopping here!",
        "Solid beers on tap (dogfish head 90 min, chimay) great cocktails and excellent service. \\n\\nThank you Daniel.",
        "I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\\n\\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience.",
        "I've been 4 times now.  I continue to have a \\\"meh\\\" opinion.  Food is OK.  Certainly overpriced.  Comparable in quality to other chain Italian joints but higher in price.\\n\\nThe service is always great and the happy hour is really nice.  Worth a visit but don't expect GREAT food.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "Worst Home Depot I've ever been to. Needed a sheet of plywood cut and was told by 3 different people someone would be with me. I waited for 30 minutes for something that should have taken 5 minutes at the most. The store was empty and there were employees near the front in a circle on their phones. No excuses for their inability to help.",
        "Not a big casino like others on the strip. What I liked about this place was that it wasn't crowded. Next time I would like to hit up the stores during business hours.",
        "These reviews are so right this is the worst store I have ever been to. There is a man who works there named Jason that is the rudest person I have ever met.  I have only found one sales person in there that knows what they are doing and has a good attitude.",
        "Absolutely love this place!!!! I would (and have) recommended many people here for the best airbrush tan. Donna is all around great - she always recommends the best color for you, makes you feel comfortable, and gets you in and out . The price is perfect and there are even deals! This is definitely my go-to when I need extra color for an event. I would never go anywhere else!",
        "I am so excited to have Americas Taco shop in Mesa now!!! Love their food, always good!!!",
        "The only record store in Vegas left that I will shop at now that Big B's Cds & Records - CLOSED!",
        "Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \\n\\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\\n\\nGet in here!!",
        "Nope. Went for dinner tonight. The place was dirty. The sushi was very poor quality and now my husband has food poisoning. The sushi was on par with what you buy from a grocery store. Oh and there was a hair on our menu. Gross. Go to Yen's!",
        "Good service shop for basic things like a smog or quick oil change.. Prices decent, about $16 for a smog and $28 for an oil change.",
        "Best grocery store in Vegas!",
        "Not at all what was expected. The website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place, when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop.",
        "I was so frustrated with so many furniture stores that have high pressure salesman and horrible customer service such as Ashley's. I came across Jack's Warehouse purely by accident and was pleasantly surprised. As promised, their customer service was outstanding. I felt very welcomed from the moment I stepped in the door to the delivery and set up which was equally as fabulous!",
        "Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.",
        "I'll be back!  It smells like old vegas and I love it.  Friendly dealers, plenty of old slots; I hate the new ones; and my friend got regular cocktail service, even at a 15 cent slot machine!  I think the only thing that slowed him was his liver recouperating from the previous casino",
        "I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.",
        "Jumbo Jacks and their milkshakes are the two main reasons for me visiting Jack In The Box. This has been true since I was in college.  This location is clean, the staff are on the ball, orders are always correct and ready in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\nI am a fan, even though I try to cut back on fast food chains in general.",
        "SCAM!  They put synthetic oil in my car when it doesn't need it (confirmed with the dealer) and charged me over $70 for the oil change.\\n\\nAVOID THIS PLACE for their unethical business practices.",
        "I highly recommend the groomers who work here. workers and the owner are really caring. I've been a long time customer of this store because of their groomer and really great customer service.",

        "Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.",
        "A great store for rugger tragics and Antipodean lost souls like me...if only they poured a pint as well I'd never leave!",
        "Wonderful locally owned boutique. Carries great brands you can't find everywhere and amazing staff. Very quaint store. I highly recommend checking out Shop Pepper.",
        "Small sparse store with a limited selection of books and products. Well intentioned, but sparse. Maybe their classes are good..I do not know!!",
        "We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby,  Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it.  The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!",
        "This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.",
        "Wonderful little cheese shop with a variety of cheeses you've never heard of or heard of but never tasted. You can buy small pieces - orphans, they call them - so that you can taste without spending a bundle. There are gifts for foodies, too: jams, confits, crackers, etc. Really friendly staff and great sandwiches. Wish this had been around during my days at UW-Madison.",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",
        "Great donuts, bad service.  I've been there three times, ordered the same donuts (6 gourmet) and was charged 3 different prices.  When I told the salesperson, she had an attitude.  This review is for the store at Town Square.  Thanks to the service, I'm not going back!"

Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs.

Never heard of it but it got great reviews on Yelp so we gave it a whirl before the Lady Gaga show.  \\n\\nThe Hatch mac n' cheese was extremely tasty and my friend's nachos looked delish.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Extremely reasonably priced too!",
        "This was my first time in and I was not disappointed!! I loved it so much that I am going to return tomorrow for lunch!! The chips and salsa are delicious and tacos are perfectly portioned! I can't wait to go back and try it all! The atmosphere is great too! Once you try this place you will be hooked!! :)",
        "Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas. We really enjoy the beet selection of my favorite beers was the Fullers ESB it's English and went perfectly with my meal. We were one very happy couple and will be returning soon .",
        "Have visited twice.  Second time was better than the first.  Nothing memorable though.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  Good flavor.  Would recommend, but try Cut first.  I need to try again though, a lot of good reviews about the dry aged here.  It won't disappoint but may leave you wanting more.",
        "We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.",
        "This is an easy 5 stars. Amazing decor and atmosphere. Great selection and perfectly done steaks. My favorite is the rib eye bone in.",
        "Dropped in for  a quick coffee break. The coffee was extremely mild, but tolerable enough to drink. Our waitress was absolutely lovely and the place was inviting and comfortable. \\n\\nI tasted Irn-Bru for the first time!!!! Unfortunately, it tasted like carbonated cane syrup and had a bright orange...radioactive orange colouring. : (",
        "This Buffalo Wild Wings is laid out much more nicely than some of the others I've been to. TVs everywhere, including right over your tables, and good lighting so you can actually see your food. And the wings, of course, are delicious.",
        "Quite possibly the worst Tex-Mex meal ever served.  I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010.  What a disaster.  It was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was.  Save for the chips and salsa, complete disaster.",
        "I had to give it the four stars because my wife loved her curry and I thoroughly enjoyed mine. I had the mango chicken curry and my wife had the pineapple chicken curry and both were well balanced in flavor. The sweetness from the fruit was perfectly offset by the spiciness and the coconut cream gave the curry a great texture. We also ordered the 'fresh rolls' aka spring rolls and they were good but nothing out of the norm. The young waiter was very polite and prompt.",
        "I ordered delivery after a long day on campus and it cost $13 for a gyro, fries and a soda. I normally don't mind paying the extra cash for a delicious meal but the fries were room temperature by the time I got them and the gyro was just okay. This meal was not worth the money. I will not be returning to this place.",
        "Worst experience ever! Why does a hookah bar open at noon but won't serve hookah until 4 pm? Four employees here chatting and on their phones neglecting to help or even acknowledge other patrons. It's the end of December and their heaters outside don't work? Have been here for 45 minutes and not checked on once by any employee at all. Worst customer service experience in all of Vegas.",
        "This is a nice little pizza place, one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil. The cheese on the knots didn't really stick well, but it was all pretty good as well.",
        "I called to place an order for delivery. When the guy at the store answered the phone I told him I would like to place an order for delivery. He asked if I wanted to place the order over the phone with him or online? Why would I call the store and tell him that I wanted to place an order for delivery if my intent was in any way to place my order online. What a moron!  I'll have nothing thanks!    1:00 PM.  January 8 2015",
        "i'm sooo glad we didn't have a lot time in here because my credit card would be moaning from all the abuse. adorable pin-up clothes, bathing suits, lingerie, shoes, and accessories line the racks and walls. the sales rack had lots of cute things freshly marked down, and the girls were very helpful and sweet.  guess i just have to hit Vegas again in January what a bummer...",
        "Hubby and I wanted to warm up from the 30 degree weather so pho seemed like a good idea. Service was good. Restaurant was clean and pretty busy. I didn't really enjoy the pho with beef slices. It had a weird sweet after taste. I've tasted a lot of pho in my day. And I just didn't care for it. My husband enjoyed the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce. Sorry, I can't find a reason to go back.",
        "YEAH!!!!  Dunkin Donuts has finally opened in my neighborhood!  It is in the same shopping center as Walmart (not a fan)...Donuts are so yummy!  Do I really need to  write a review? Opened on June 24 (my birthday) it was the priority of the day to go and get an iced coffee and donut!  Jason the owner is super nice.  Go in and get your donut and coffee!!",
        "Not much new to report here from my initial review way back in January.  Mike C. & I dropped in for lunch today, & it's still a cafeteria, not a buffet, & it's still all-you-can-eat of a big variety of excellent American food for one LOW price!  Right now it's $6.99 Adult or Sr., including beverage.\\n\\nYum!     :-))",
        "Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",
        "A relatively small but very nice resort. Next time I bring the wife to Phoenix and need to stay someplace different than a typical chain hotel, this place will fit the bill nicely. There is a nearby upscale mall with upscale restaurants that can be walked to in less than 15 minutes. Our room on the 2nd floor was nice and quiet and had nice ameneties such as a flat screen tv. My only peeve was the crazy daily resort fee.",
        "If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\\n\\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever.",
        "Found this place through yelp. Service and food was amazing. I got an omelet as a scramble and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit was also toasted for me on the grill which I loved! ONE WARNING! The portions are GIGANTIC! I barely finished half my omelet. My boyfriend got the mamas and it looked like something out of man vs. food! If you hung over and hungry this is the place to go!",
        "First time in Denny's visiting Vegas from NYC. Hmmm NO Avoid this chain. Can we say extra extra Butter on everything including the butter? lol Yea no never again...",
        "Whenever I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to stop by CASA FUENTE. A mojito and one of the house blend torpedos. Sitting in the patio watching Sportscenter on one of the TVs. Nice way to spend an afternoon. The nights are pretty cool too. Especially during the weekend of the BIG SMOKE in November. The prices are not cheap, but, IT\\\"S VEGAS BABY!!!!",
        "Went for lunch today for the first time. HMMMM expected a little more than we got. The service was great, but the food-so-so. Both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry. I asked for extra mayo but it never came. And COKE in a can for $2.50....come on, with those prices get a fountain. I probably won't be back.",
        "I went to this place for lunch. It was a little crowded, but the service was still fast and friendly. Our food came out quickly, and it tasted very good. It actually had a medium amount of spice like we requested, unlike some places where even the mild is still uncomfortably spicy. Everything tasted very good, and was a reasonable price (we ordered from the lunch menu). I'll be going back.",
        "I usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run. Plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up. Stems on grapes in the salad. Graffiti in the bathroom. Disappointed.",
        "Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!",
        "Hmmm if I ever go back to Pittsburgh maybe I will be able to check out the Strip when there's actually people around - it was pretty empty when we were there, unfortunately.  There were at least a few coffee shops around and one over-priced chocolate shop, not much else though that I saw in the way of anything interesting.  Maybe we were on the wrong street or maybe just bad timing.",
        "We ordered the 10.99 special with steak. The steaks were the perfect size for us and they were cooked perfectly. I had a delicious wedge salad and my wife had the best spinach salad ever. It came with garlic spinach. Yum. The steak came with a really good vadalia onion sauce. We have eaten at several all over the country and we get the small sre",
        "In the LVRJ on Tuesday 15th of January , Mark Larkin from Larkin Plumbing was quoted saying a PVB replacement after freezing should cost between $200 & $400, and after my discount my estimate was $605. I had the repair carried out by licensed plumber for $220. \\n Just saying.....",
        "If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "I was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker. I wish there were something like that in OC. Apparently they have a HUGE soccer following..we were there in January. A good time!",
        "I whole-heartadly and HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.....the service was perfect and the food was phenominal.....we ate here for my wife's birthday on August 1st and I can't say enough.  I love the tastings between courses, the exceptional food quality and energetic staff.  They have taken a strip mall location and made it one of the best dining options in the area.  Congratulations!",
        "Ordered a chicken burrito here on Friday, June 28th.  Onset of FOOD POISONING was swift and severe.  Spent Saturday pretty much bed-ridden.",
        "Hmm.  Don't know anything about Peruvian food but it was just okay.  Had fried yucca, which was pretty good, also a slow cooked beef called Seco, and a shrimp dish.  We'll give it a second try but it was a little disappointing.  The place bills itself as Peruvian-Chinese but there were only a few items that were actually fusion dishes and the one I tried, a fried rice, was passable but nothing special.",
        "Banh mi dog looked great, but taste was lacking. The dog itself was rubbery and bland while the topping of lightly pickled veggies was pretty good.",
        "Their beer selection was super, but pricey!  I got a Yuengling and it cost $4.75.  Hmm?  The service was pretty good and the food was alright, it just seemed a little overpriced.",
        "This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!",
        "Walked in at 1:15am August 10, 2014 & walked out 1:30.. A waitress touched pancakes with her dirty ass hands after she rang up seven people at the cash register . & serve the pancakes cold as well.",
        "This place is delicious. You pick your choice of meat (chicken, steak, ground beef, pork and others) they place it in a corn tortilla for you and the rest is up to you. They have many choices at the salsa bar. You can go mild or very hot. All tacos are $2.50 each. They take cash or you can go inside the store and pay with a credit card.",
        "Out of business as of June 3, 2011!  When I called to make a reservation to use my Groupon, which does not expire until June 21, I was told that the restaurant was shut down for renovation for the rest of the summer, and that the Groupon would not be honored when they reopen.  These people are thieves.",
        "AWESOME chips and salsa! I ordered the Carne Asada steak and it was cooked perfectly! Their double Cadillac margaritas are AMAZING!",

        "Prepare to savor each bite when you visit Mark and Maria's - you'll have the opportunity as things move at their own pace here. Nothing wrong with that as the food is amazing. Just learn to work the system and things work out very nicely, ie be prepared to order, go to the counter to pay your bill! Only place in Phoenix I have as a 'must visit' on a weekly basis.",
        "Horrible. From the price of juice and milk for kids to the moldy grapes that laid on my food and I mean white mold. Disgusting. Lost my appetite. Service is very very slow and there was only 5 tables. For a place that had steak in their name my daughter did not eat her steak and eggs as it was a horrible peace of cheap sirloin. We live a block a way and will never go back again.",
        "Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.",
        "We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!",

        "Best \\\"Buffet\\\" that I have ever eaten at.  From the perfectly crafted food to the small portions...this place has it all.  I will probably be eating here at least once every time I come to Vegas, it has become a staple for me!\\n\\nI suggest taking a once-around before committing to anything you choose, because there are soooo many great dishes available.  be warned, COME HUNGRY!",
        "I did not expect the old strip to have a nice steakhouse but this place was great. I thought the old strip in general would be super ghetto and don't get me wrong it is a different scene for sure but it's really come a long way. The golden nugget has been updated nicely and Vic and Anthony's was delicious. Probably one of the better steaks I've had in a while! Nice wine selection and great service as well!",
        "Just got my brows and lip done and all I have to say is wow!! Totally professional environment and so modern inside. I have really weird shaped eyebrows that pose a challenge for many estheticians but they were shaped perfectly here. My esthetician (forgot her name I'm sorry) even showed me how to correctly fill them in afterward. Reasonably priced for such a great job!",

        "This company moved us from San Tan Valley, AZ, to Prescott Valley, AZ, in September, 2014.  Most of the move went well.  When we hit a few rough spots and some damages,  the owner, Derek, stepped in immediately, kept his word on all repairs, and stuck to the original moving estimate - even though it was off by a more than small amount.  Rare to find a moving company this ethical.  We won't hesitate to recommend them to our friends.",

        "Panama is a fancy Greek Restaurant. This is NOT a Casa Grecque type of Greek Restaurant. It is more expensive then other \\\"fast food Greek\\\" locations. However its worth the price.

        "I love Chick-fil-A. Their food is good, but their customer service and staff are incredible.

Thank you Robert, Stephanie, and the rest of your staff!",
        "Have come here many times but today was the first time I had Bekah for a massage. Her hands are magic! The pressure was just right and she hit all my stress points perfectly. I will definitely be asking for her when I return! I definitely recommend a membership to take advantage of monthly massage and/or facials. I have been coming here for over a year and it is worth every penny.",
        "Gilbert is really a nice guy and very professional. He came on time of my flight. Fitted my luggage nicely. I had 5 huge luggage and some small ones too. He drives very carefully.",
        "The staff was really friendly and inviting but I was there for two hours for a mani pedi. I found a picture on their yelp site of a design that I wanted. They said yes of course we can do that. My nails look nothing like the picture. It cost $80.00 for both and it looks awful. I was treated nicely but the services they provided were not good and that is  why I won't go back.",
        "The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\\n\\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\\n\\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.",
        "Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.  The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience.",
        "Great German beer and food. I will be back!!",
        "Lots of unique gifts and everyday coffee/tea enthusiast accessories.  Sort of a new and old, dark design which fits the style nicely.  \\nI was merely popping in for a quick coffee.  The coffee I got, but the quickness, not so much.  This, obviously, can be expected in busy coffee shops from time to time, so i'm cool with it.  The coffee was quite good, but i'd be remiss to pop in if there was a big line.",
        "Very cost effective, lighting fast service but never once felt rushed. There was a wide variety for the selection of food and everything that came to our table was cooked perfectly. The Egg and I manages to feel like a neighborhood diner and your family's house all at the same time. No better place in town for breakfast for both taste and value.",
        "Came here in July. It was hot. Not just hot but hot as hell. That was inside. On the balcony. There was a cool view of downtown Fremont. But it is even hotter. I was in there looking for air conditioning vents. The bar was OK. Nothing real special besides the view of the Fremont. I would return in a cooler month if i am downtown again. The music was good. That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.",
        "Soooo happy we came here!!! I'm not usually a fan of eating Indian food at a restaurant but we came here for father's day and we not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too. If you like Indian food, you must try this place."

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",

The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",

I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!!

The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper.

The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it.

It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",

There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Fun.  Like many things in Vegas, this copy of the Munich Hoffbrau Haus has all of the form and none of the substance.  If you're looking for an authentic experience, this only partly fits that bill.  That said, the place is blast and I've always had a good time.",

        "When I purchased a used Dell from Foxetech Alex was great to work with.  I give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget.  He as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "Not bad, service was on the slower side, but then again it was lunch time 12-1pm but very friendly and quick cashier",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "calling it the best ball park in America is a total understatement, its the greatest ever. not a bad seat there. Pittsburgh has been very lucky, we hit home runs with PNC & Console but of course Heinz Field is a turkey. As Meat Loaf would say 2 out of 3 ain't bad!!!!",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "I would like to give a review but they were out of mostly all the great goodies that were recommended to me, therefore I will have to go back after the holiday.",
        "Came here with friends for a birthday dessert. Quaint atmosphere with very attentive staff. Tried the Strawberry Kiss, Chocolate Brownie, and profiteroles. Hella good.",
        "Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.",
        "We visited this Sunday afternoon. There were three other pairs there and one person on the internet. The lattes were good. There were still a few pastries, but very little bread available. We wanted a sourdough, but no luck.",
        "It ok not worth all the hype. No space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again .",
        "Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "THIRTEEN places that sell SHOES??? Run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess!",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "decent... i had the \\\"sin city\\\" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers....",
        "This is pretty nice for the money. It's sort of hard to find as you walk down the street. It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage. We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "Not only are they the SLOWEST pharmacy they very seldom have the medication in stock that you will need. Do yourself a favor and go down the road and don't even bother stopping here they're going to send you to Desert Inn location anyways.",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "Seems a little small and cramped.  Location is ok, prices cheap.  Salesmen have a weird vibe- you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service.",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "I love the eclectic atmosphere. ..I also love the assortment of desserts!! The lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast. My favorite sweet is the Salted Caramel Brownie. .soooooo yummy!!!!",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!",
        "Not very good",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "I go to Ari Sushi whenever I can. Good rolls, great price for the area (so close to scottsdale..) I just love pretty much everything about the atmosphere and feel of the place too. Nice for people who want a feel of a family sushi place. They actually place Japanese music too.",
        "Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working",
        "I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.",
        "Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.",
        "eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",
        "This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.",
        "It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing.",
        "This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.",
        "I just found out that Harrah's is the largest hotel/casino operator in the world.  I am completely amazed.  I have been to several of the Harrah's locations and never, ever thought they would be the biggest.  Based on the level of service, they are just \\\"ok\\\".\\n\\nSpend your dollars elsewhere.",
        "Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no\\nEVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses",
        "This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.",
        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",
        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old.",
        "I will echo the comments of everyone else. This was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park, although it technically is a fountain. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area it's worth the stop.",
        "Tried them twice now, and as far as Italian goes, pretty bland.  Service was kind if stuffy too",
        "The best steak house on the strip.  The roasted steaks are great.  Fries should not be missed!  Quite expensive.  Awesome service.  Incredible wine list (study it before you dine).",
        "see the waitress?  see her ignore you?  see a bartender ?  good luck if you can find one...maybe they are hiding somewhere?  big points on the art and decor, the music is usually stellar, but the service is really lacking.  there is a really good selection of beer, somewhat pricey.  the hummus is really good.  oh but why is the Indian serving the naked goddess on the painting above the bar?  that will have you stumped for hours!",
        "The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.\\n\\nWhen returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.\\n\\nUnprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.",
        "Food is OK after you finally get it. Waited 45 min for breakfast and my girlfriend's food was cold. They said no problem, it will only take a minute to replace....took 10. Friendly but incapable service. 2nd try and last.",
        "This guy Gerry is as good as it gets, he wont rip you off, and his work stands the test of time, at least with the two vessels he has repaired for us. He's pretty quick and very knowledgable , very fair with his pricing as well. So as long as we have boats we'll be using Gerry when we need major repairs.",
        "We got there around 10 am on Sunday.   We were seated right away and got a booth.  Our waitress was most delightful.  Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive. \\n\\nFood came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large. \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait."

        "One of the more crowded and more popular places on Mill, but sometimes it will take 10-15 min to get a drink. Fun place to play some pool and have a few drinks. The long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few. Overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars.",
        "Crazy lines, but good thing we have VIP passes to skip the madness.\\n\\nEvery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit! How can a girl in heels survive?\\n\\nGreat music though.",

        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",

        "I went to Mariana's specifically to pick up tamales for Christmas '09.  What a mistake.  There was too much masa, and not nearly enough meat.\\n\\nAnd, thy must have used too much lard and not enough water to make the masa because it was thick and hard like plaster...evn though they were taken right out of the cooker.\\n\\nWhat a total disappointment,",
        "Possibly the best food bargain outside of a down-market casino in Las Vegas!\\n\\nThey don't have In-N-Out Burger in Chicago, where I'm from, so I always try to stop here when I'm in Vegas.  The food is really fresh, including hand-cut french fries.  Avoid this place on the weekends and during lunch, however; it gets really crowded.",

My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "One of those places you just go when you are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian because it's so convenient, has that menu item that every person in your party wants whether it be fake pho noodle soup or a burger, and you can crawl into the restaurant at 1:00am to satisfy your drunk hunger.... \\n\\nThe bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal.\\nThe service is really slow....",
        "This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.",
        "Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle.",
        "Decent venue, well run, drinks are about what you'd expect. Overall you need to go when there is a good DJ, we had some second rate DJs who aren't local, but aren't good. It was a fun time, but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it.",
        "overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. \\nemployee came and reprimanded her.",

Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",

We are looking forward to booking another class soon- maybe with some friends this time.",

I love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere.  If only it weren't so chaotic and crowded, but why should I think such a great place wouldn't get noticed?",
        "Yes this place is absolutely our \\\"Must Have Breakfast\\\" spot whenever we are in Vegas!! We always order the Corn Beef Hash, best i've ever had! I must say though, since Yelp, this hole in the wall spot has become extremely popular (or shall I say crowded). The last time we were here, the waitress was a bit overwhelmed with customers however, she did handle it like a champ :)",
        "Great and friendly staff which is very important. Food is definitely impressing. Enjoyed my very first Irish coffee I've ever had. The venue is so adorable & makes me feel like I'm in a different place. The live music adds to the excitement in this pub. Definitely will go back and will recommend to my friends & guests of my resort. \\n\\nTwo thumbs up!!!",
        "Uncomfortable beds, tiny cramped rooms, and too far away from everything. I guess you can't beat the price, though - hence the two stars.

There are three rows of \\\"stadium\\\" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!",

        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "Fun little concert venue with indoor and outdoor stages.  They have Hop Knot on tap which makes me happy.  Would not ever have a mixed drink there again however...there is something really off in the flavor of their fountain soda.",
        "FYI: Google/Yelp renders the location incorrectly, it's actually about a mile south of where it appears making this a difficult location to check-in at. It's in the shopping center just south of the 202 next to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. Bing maps this address correctly, Google will if you change the Address to Gilbert 85236.",
        "Good food, crowded, hurried service  (the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said \\\"you done\\\")",
        "Very clean and not crowded on weekends. They do price match only with Fry's, Safeway, Albertson and Basha.",
        "Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time.",
        "I went to this place for lunch. It was a little crowded, but the service was still fast and friendly. Our food came out quickly, and it tasted very good. It actually had a medium amount of spice like we requested, unlike some places where even the mild is still uncomfortably spicy. Everything tasted very good, and was a reasonable price (we ordered from the lunch menu). I'll be going back.",
        "This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!",
        "-Smaller amusement park\\n-Overpriced food\\n-Long lines\\n-Didn't have a \\\"fast pass\\\" system\\n-Always crowded\\n-Parking was awful\\n-Good rides were closed\\n\\n...Typical amusement park.",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience.",
        "This is one of the worst labs I have ever been to and I tried it more than once.  One time I sat in the jam packed waiting room for over 45 minutes without a single patient being called.  The staff were unbelievably rude and it is always insanely crowded.  If you can manage the Sonora Quest in Glendale takes appointments and has always been great.",
        "checkin/checkout is really slow and crowded with the huddled masses, public areas are very smokey, restaurants are over priced, wish we had stayed at the venetian.",
        "Beer specials are great....   $1.99 pints.   Chips are great and portions are large.   The sopa de pollo (chicken soup)  is excellent.  Great place for all the road warriors in the two Hilton properties down the street.",
        "Quite crowded with visitors and very nice music. Awesome!",
        "Absolutely Pleasant staff.  Great food, quite a surprise.  My company put me up at the Hampton Inn, so I wasn't expecting to find a comfortable place for some grub and a beer.\\nI'll make sure to come back next time I'm anywhere near Las Vegas.\\n(Try the brisket sliders, wow)",
        "What a horrible experience-had an emergency and needed to cancel my reservation more than 48 hours in advance...got the total runaround, talked to a bunch of people I couldn't understand only to be told no cancellations except 72 hours in advance.  Beware, do not book because you might have an emergency and hilton grand Elara is too big to care.",
        "Here for dinner with my family.  We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort.  Nice location, casual dining.  Good menu with choices.  Service was OK, food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party.  Overall, OK experience.",
        "Meh, I was not impressed overall. It was just too crowded to play the games, people kept bumping into each other.",
        "Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection, but it was so crowded the service was not great.",
        "We love coming in two movies for the whole family for what it costs for a single ticket at AMC or Edwards.  The food is also reasonably priced not a gouge like the aforementioned chain theaters.  Do yourself a favor go see all you movies here !!",
        "This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself.",
        "We used to go to this restaurant all the time and used to love it. They recently changed owners and this places is not the same. The menu is different.  The drinks are not as good. The origin of the wines are no longer shown on the wine list. The prices are much higher. The place has lost its Spanish ambiance.  The little touches such as the shot of liquor at the end of the meal has been discarded. Would not be back again.",
        "The worst part of this airport is their designated recharge zones are cramped, awkward, and there's never any power outlets available. There are scattered power outlets in very strange places throughout the airport so if you see a bunch of unrelated travelers stand around a wall of open space, they have struck gold. Wi Fi is free!\\n\\nThere's a lot of cute little shops to look at including an oxygen bar, a chocolate shop, and random souvenir items.",
        "$18 for a bowl of soup with a 1/2 pound of spagetti noodles, two thin slices of beef, a pinch of basil, a pinch of bean sprouts and a pinch of cilantro with a couple hot peppers.  Maybe it was because it was the end of my four days in Vegas and it gets tiring to be hammered with overpriced food day after day after day, but this was the final straw.",
        "Interior lighting has been brightened, thus losing the cool-hip and dim feel that I craved so much from DELUX. Liquor menu is WAY OUT dated, staff made no effort to compensate. Prices have gone up. Service is consistently INCONSISTENT. There's a TON of places where you can get an $8 cocktail and $10 burger..",
        "I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables.",
        "I love the food bacon was amazing!\\nPancakes weren't fluffy or that good. :(\\nBUT hate the noise!!!!!\\nYou can even hear yourself eat. It was crowded and everyone was talking, it got so deafing you couldn't enjoy your meal. \\nThey need to do something about the acoustics in the restaurant.",
        "The most hostile people I have ever met.  Horrible in every respect, I am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver.  My experience with XS was hands down the worst I have ever had with any venue, ever.  They ruined my birthday, embarrassed me, and I believe potentially charged me for it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!",
        "This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here.",
        "This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those.",
        "Everything here is tasty.  They can be crowded, so expect that!  Wish they were open later when my friends want to go boozing and I want an espresso!",
        "Everything was fine, just surprised anyhow old of movies they were still playing. Some had been in theaters 3-4 months. Seems to be the jr. High hangout place",
        "Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!",
        "The wings are to die for, atmosphere is nice, crowded but spacious enough to eat and be comfortable. I couldn't see the menu cause it's a little dark. Lol prices are great.",
        "This place is on par with every other sandwich chain like it. I still prefer Wildflower Bread Co, but this is a good place to see the real housewives of Gilbert during the week.",
        "I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue.",
        "Dharma Lounge is the perfect size venue with a very loungy feel which is refreshing in Charlotte over saturated market.",
        "good clean family fun, close to home and CHEAP! Compared to going to Sun Splash or Big Surf, sure it's not a mega park, but close, cheap, clean, and fun for the kids. We have our own backyard pool, this is a fun change of venue that won't break you.",
        "It has an unique layout, and although there is a lot of space- it is crowded.  I did find it easier to get a drink here versus other clubs on the same weekend.  The crowd is a little older, but not old.  The night I was there, I didn't see any issues with the dress code as others have commented.",
        "This place is unique because you are sitting outside in a garden that is covered when it is raining, the food was alright but it was over priced and there are very limited options for vegetarians, and almost none for vegans.\\n\\nI know this isn't the right town for a vegetarian or a vegan but they could add a few more options for us. I am giving them 3 stars for the atmosphere and excellent service.",
        "bloody mary, Amir, 70 degrees, Kona and v-land!!!! Perfect!! Great happy hour selection, beautiful outdoor venue, great drinks, delish Pad Tai !!!",
        "We waited hours to get in by the time we got in I was not hungry... I did not see anything exceptional so crowded .   I guess if you love crab legs then enjoy. but i dont eat that....  Disappointed... and expensive!   I rather pay that price and have a nice sit down dinner!",
        "stayed here on my first visit to vegas.  my friend worked for hilton at the time and got the rooms for free, so why not.  found it to be pretty decent.  the thing is, this place is off the strip, and that made it a major PITA.",
        "Ambiance: plenty of seating & cozy.. was not crowded the 2 times I went\\n\\nService: Barista is a sweet, polite young lady\\n\\nCoffee: chai latte is DELICIOUS-- perfectly sweet... esp good with the white chocolate gingerbread biscotti.. gingerbread latte isn't as great",
        "These guys really hosed me on book of mormon tix, always go through the venue. Thomas on the phone was 13 & needs some work on his social skills. Beware of stubhub. I should've listened to friends but I wanted those tickets\\n I learned the hard way, I want to save anyone else from a similar situation.",
        "Blech. Go to the Piglet instead. The bigger Blind Pig location is crowded, dark and full of hipsters. The beer selection is okay, but not great, and if you prefer spirits (I'm a bourbon drinker) go to Seven Saints or Boltini. Hell, the cider selection is even weak- they have like two or three bottles and occasionally one draft.",
        "I loved this place! My BFF4LIFE.. made a good choice! The room was beautiful... nice view, distance mountains. The location was a bit off the strip (which I didn't mind) but it was banging! The staff was lovely, the guest were friendly and the ALCOHOL WS... FREEEEEE! =)",
        "Loud and chaotic. Very attentive manager. But seemed to be understaffed. Everything was done at a very fast pace. Not a very relaxing atmosphere. The gnoochi were fine and the pizzas were big enough for two people but not all that tasteful. If you were looking for a sit down Italian meal and didnt want to get dressed up and get reservations, this place will do fine.",
        "Service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all. Very much overrated. We had to ask for silverware and water twice. It wasn't very crowded either. Nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank. Only above average item was the French toast.",
        "Great Food...best Greek Salad!!  A little small gets crowded fast. Prices  Good !  love the New one in old town Scottsdale",
        "Eek - If you are considering getting married here I would bring in your own Wedding Planner who is a Professional ! The lady running this is extremely rude and does not work well with families or vendors !   USually when you are a planner at a venue you solve problems and dont just shrug you shoulders and ay oh well ! -",
        "I had the \\\"Whatever Burger\\\" and it was Amazing! one of the best burgers I've ever had. and it is the reason that I give the place a high score. Its cramped with limited seating but that kinda adds to the character of the place. but our waitress was kinda lost and confused about the menu and drinks. and took her 20 min to bring a water.\\n\\nIt is very much worth going to if you have time!",
        "Just opened following winter over seeding. Course played surprisingly well. Tees and fairways were in good shape. The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \\\"automatic 2-putt\\\" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again.",
        "We ordered the 44 Magnum with the extra shot and 1/2 yard. Between my honey and I we were definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol by the time we made it back out to the street. Well worth the $12. Unfortunately I've got a horrid headache now at 7pm from all the cheap liquor from today.",
        "Aaron you have awesome customer service skills and also to the brunette bar tender!  You guys are awesome although the nacho's was a feat that crushed my confidence because of the large portion i will be sure to bring backup next time. Made a few friends too gregg and mariam from cali and mark from nm! Hope you see this hit this place up with a good review!",
        "AMC Deer Valley 30 is close to my pad and convenient. It's a regular ol modern movie theater, nothing too special, nothing to alarming. As the name implies, there are 30 different theaters inside, so movie hoppers rejoice here.\\n\\nWe like to hit it before noon on Sundays to take advantage of the $5 early bird ticket price specials.",
        "I went to this place after work yesterday around 4:30ish to get a simple pedi. Lady who helped me was nice enough, didn't bother to small talk which was fine with me. She was a little rough when messaging my legs. I got a classic pedi with callus removal, it was the most effective callus removal treatment I have ever had. Classic pedi was $20 plus $5 for the callus removal, price is reasonable, I will return.",
        "I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \\nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that."

Thanks Desert Dog Pet Care you ROCK!!!!!!!",
        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",

        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",

The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",

        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)!

Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",

        "Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.",

        "Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",

        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",

I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "calling it the best ball park in America is a total understatement, its the greatest ever. not a bad seat there. Pittsburgh has been very lucky, we hit home runs with PNC & Console but of course Heinz Field is a turkey. As Meat Loaf would say 2 out of 3 ain't bad!!!!",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",

        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",

It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.",

        "The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!",
        "My partner and I received excellent treatments from Kathy and Yolanda. Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be returning for Kathy's strong and skilled deep tissue massage.

Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",

We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",

        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "Not only are they the SLOWEST pharmacy they very seldom have the medication in stock that you will need. Do yourself a favor and go down the road and don't even bother stopping here they're going to send you to Desert Inn location anyways.",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Never having has gellato before, this was definitely a lot easier on the wallet and feet than going over to the ice creamery on The Strip. Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "Great sushi and service.  The 5th star just being held back because of the high prices.  Incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Not what I expected. It almost looked like a starbucks when I walked in BUT BOY WAS I WRONG Best coffee I have ever had! Beautiful foam designs on every coffee.. Lots of vegan choices, sandwiches, burritos, pastries, an outstanding vegan muffin and regular egg breakfast type sandwiches. A fantastic fun find and a must if you are vegan. Unique and Good",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "Not very good",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working",
        "Great service.  Large portions.  A bit tricky to find the place in the dark but it's worth it.",
        "I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.",
        "Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.",
        "eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people",
        "Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic.",
        "This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.",
        "It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing.",
        "This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.",
        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",
        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",
        "I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.",
        "I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old.",
        "The best steak house on the strip.  The roasted steaks are great.  Fries should not be missed!  Quite expensive.  Awesome service.  Incredible wine list (study it before you dine).",
        "The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.\\n\\nWhen returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.\\n\\nUnprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.",
        "This guy Gerry is as good as it gets, he wont rip you off, and his work stands the test of time, at least with the two vessels he has repaired for us. He's pretty quick and very knowledgable , very fair with his pricing as well. So as long as we have boats we'll be using Gerry when we need major repairs.",
        "We got there around 10 am on Sunday.   We were seated right away and got a booth.  Our waitress was most delightful.  Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive. \\n\\nFood came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large. \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait.",
        "We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back.",
        "I love this place and so do my kids!  Tonight I went for fishing gear for the kids.  This is an area I know nothing about.  Brad in the fishing department was very friendly and very helpful.  He spent a good 10-15 minutes with me helping me to pick out the right trout fishing equipment.   Thanks Brad!\\n\\nThis place caters to kids with activities for them on Tuesday nights and occasionally on weekends.  Check out their website.",
        "Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\\n\\n\\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00.",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "Service was great! Staff was very polite and we were seen right away. My daughter seen Dr. Hill who was very kind and made her laugh. Would recommend.",
        "Just tried calling in a to-go order and again, they don't even answer the frigging phone, they just immediately slam it down into hold.  Quite possibly the RUDEST bunch of people I have come across EVER.  Go to the Shea location instead.  Not only do they have nice people working there, but the pizza is even better for some reason.",
        "Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience. This is a hotel that doesn't need to copy any other hotels.\\n\\nI recommend this great experience to all. Oh yea, lots of good looking people here...hehe.",
        "This place is $5 for adults $2 for kids, and everything there is to do costs even more money. The website doesnt say any of this. I'm very aggravated that i spent $11 to get me and my kids in here and still cant do anything without paying at least $3 more PER KID. I feel rather ripped off. I wont be back.",

        "Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.",
        "I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SHOW. \\n\\nPlain and Simple.\\n\\nIt was AWESOME. \\n\\nLoved the interpretations, the symbols, the movements, the music, the costumes, the comedic relief. Zumanity showed all the different sides & angles in \\\"sex\\\"\\n\\nCant wait to go a 2nd time. This time Front Row Booth baby!",
        "Best LFS in Town!!! Very friendly  staffs... James & Jorell are very helpful!! Whatever fish you would like to find... They will try their hardest to find you the rare/special fish.... Case in point.. They got me a Black Tang.  I have been looking for so long... Thanks guys!!!",
        "In town visiting a college on Jan. 3rd, 2013.  Hotel person recommended Oregano's so we thought we would give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Our waitress was very good - Sarah.  I had the turkey and provolone sandwich, my husband had the Italian sandwich and my daughter had the garlic chicken lasagne.  If we lived here we could eat there again but alas there is no Oreganos in Fresno, CA.",

        "James beard nominated chef, gourmet magazine says best Thai restaurant in north America, wine spectator award...All True and more.  Anyone who rated this place less than 4 stars needs to go back to panda express where you belong.  Incredible food, amazing wine list that's has some bottles of wine below retail.  Nothing else compares!!",
        "Food was very good, waiter (Chris) provided excellent service.  They did sit us on temporary chairs (by the kitchen too) though.\\n\\nNot much use even posting this because they are closing soon.",
        "I saw the show in Sacramento, CA and overall I liked it. All jokes, tricks was understandable as I am from Europe. I felt as I was back to my childhood . Animals and performers were good. My 8 year old son enjoyed the show. The only pros that I have that the price was too expensive for the location it was used for the show : old movie theatre that was a cheap , poor place not in a nice neighborhood .",
        "This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. \\n\\nYou have to see this if you are in Vegas!",
        "So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  \\n\\nThe store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.",
        "As far as college students go, this is the place to be for birthdays and pregaming. For birthdays, you get all-you-can-drink free beer, mug, a tiny sundae and a balloon. My friends and I all love the cheese curds with gritty sauce and the gritty burgers. Power hour (every night from 10-11pm) has $1 mixers and is the best bar to begin drinking at.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",

        "Small sparse store with a limited selection of books and products. Well intentioned, but sparse. Maybe their classes are good..I do not know!!",
        "Came here because of the rating.  Food was average in taste and quality and pricey to boot.  Atmosphere is very basic at best...kind of like a run down college diner.   On the plus side, food was served almost instantly and the bbq sauce was tasty.",
        "Spend time there several times, even bought some Groupons, but lately the wait staff is not very attentive. You have to ask for refills and no name introduction or real eye contact. Drinks are good...Chris the bartender is the exception as he actually talks to you and makes great drinks.",

I have bought everything from Tom Clancy books to a cookbook by Gordon Ramsay, and everything in between.  Recently, they also offered a groupon, $40 worth of material for $20.  If you are looking for a great deal, stop in.",

        "I agree that it's not bad, and for a starving college student like myself, you can't beat the price! \\nI had the General Chao's chicken meal deal thingy, they give you a lot of food for cheap and it's not bad mannnn... $5.45\\nSo if you're in the hood, (a.k.a. UNLV) lookin for somethin good, try China Joe's.",
        "Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved!

        "I don't shop at Bebe because I feel their clothes don't fit the average size woman. They are definitely made high fashion for size zero. \\nMost of their designs are made for the club scene with skimpy outfits and cocktail dresses. Some of their clothes are cute, but way overpriced. It also seems they want to stamp their name on EVERYTHING possible. Tacky!",
        "We love Tutti Santi! We have been going to the 16th street location for over ten years! \\n\\nI love when we walk in they know us. Service is amazing - relaxed but attentive. don't be fooled by the seemingly casual pase of your meal. \\n\\nGreat place to chill on a date or bring the family for a celebration!",

        "Never really read books but went to get magazine before.",
        "I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans.",
        "I have only been here once but let me say it was one of the best times EVER! The whole place is sooo sexy and cool. Love the girls dancing in such amazing outfits..loved the free bubbly even more!\\nI drank so much I ended up dancing on a table with some girl..the hubby loved that!\\nI need to get back again because I had so much flippin fun!!",
        "Just had lunch here and thought the food was ok. Some items have two portion sizes on them which gives the server a great opportunity to up sell the guest. The problem is they don't ask. The server just automatically gave us the large portion of everything, which is not what we wanted. Now that I know their tricks I will pay more attention IF I actually go back.",
        "I typically go here for a quick bite of Mexican food with friends or just to get a drink. I like to order out due to the countless times I have had bad experience with one guy behind the bar. He acts like he has a hang over and he couldn't get someone to cover his shift every time I go in. LOL Decent food but small portions. I want bigger burros!",

        "Another truly amazing Cirque show that needs to be seen.  The acts in this show, I believe, are the most dangerous acts I've seen in all the Cirque shows in Vegas.  The mastery of skills that were on display during the show is just incredible to watch.  The athleticism required to perform the stunts leaves me speechless.",

He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!",
        "The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!",
        "Adding another .5 Stars, they now offer sashimi on all their fish instead of filling you up with the rice in nigiri like other AYCE sushi places.\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nMinor Gripe: The hot sauce they use on the oysters totally overpowers the oyster flavor. Oh well it's all you can eat.",
        "Wow, this antique mall seems to go on and on forever. It is huge and has a wonderful selection of collectibles. I am in the market for collectible books and they had so many books, that I could not see them all in this trip. There are a lot of kitchen items, dishes and vintage toys. This is a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon. The prices were reasonable. There was a check in offer and some of the dealers booths have coupons.",

He was every bit as professional and capable as the previous reviews stated.  He made sure to call when he was on his way and showed up when he said he would and was much more reasonably priced than other services I had called.  He took his time and did a phenomenal job with 2 repairs in my home. I would call him again in a second.",

I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \\n\\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though.",
        "Stumbled in here seeing they actually had a happy hour on Sunday and it exceeded every single expectation! Katie our bartender was very sociable, knowledgeable, and especially sweet. Had the ahi poke (I wanted another one) fish tacos, burger sliders, goat cheese spread and my absolute favorite was the crab bisque. Quick chat with Kevin, the manager and the grapefruit basil cocktail made it the perfect Sunday dinner date with the other half.",

You do get what you paid for and the food is better than Ruth Chris or Mortons.",

        "Mike their \\\"broker\\\" has no personality and is rude on the phone. He is impolite to his costumer and will drop the phone on you, avoid dealing with people like him and move on to the next business that cares about costumer service.",

The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find.",
        "Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! .",
        "I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.",
        "I have been going to Bear Kneads for over a year and have worked with both Chris and Dave. They are professional and very knowledgable guys. \\n\\nI play sports and have gone to Bear Kneads for sports related injuries as well as for relaxation. Their skill level compared to other places in Charlotte is second to none, especially considering how reasonable their rates are!\\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend Bear Kneads!",
        "I sent my 18 year old college student daughter here for a procedure.  The doctors and nurses were mean, and insulting.  I would not recommend this facility.  He denegrated ASU'S academic reputation and made inappropriate comments to her.",
        "The service stunk other than the woman bartender. Three of the guys looked at me about 5 times and didn't take my order. This is a college/young crowd bar so I probably didnt belong there anyway so live and learn when your visiting from out of town.",
        "Pretty unique experience. Copious drinking, comfort food, and polka brings together a really odd combination of college kids, retirees, and yuppies.

        "What a pleasant surprise.  I selected PCG for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal, atmosphere and service. I tried the plank salmon which was wonderful.  Two of us had meals that included the mashed potatoes with horseradish and agreed the flavor was excellent.  I admit that as I approached the strip center on 16th street I wondered if I had made a mistake, only to be rewarded by my guests with compliments for the choice. I will return.",
        "This might be funny to some of you, but I never seen a Sun Devil game here. I was lucky to catch a few of the old USFL Arizona Wranglers or Arizona Outlaws games. It was a lot of fun, and I can only imagine how great it would be in a college atmosphere!!",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "My sis recommended this place to me. I wasn't sure at first but I made an appointment (I think her name was Kay) and my hair turned out great!!!! And James is very busy and each appt. looked like it lasted 30 min. Kay spent a little an hour with me. She kept checking the layers even after she blow dry my hair. Definitely going back for my next haircut!!!!!!!",

        "Food is always great, we enjoy their gyros and salads. You can add any kind of meat to the salad, their portions are good, the prices are fair. Everything is made when you order it which translates into fresh and warm food.  We just found out their chicken is organic. Always a treat, the owner Steven is very friendly and takes good care of his costumers.",
        "Worst buffalo ever. The manager is a complete dick. On a college football Saturday in the middle of important games he turned all the tvs to a UFC fight and told us that it didn't matter what we were there to see that is what was going to be on. How can you run a restaurant with absolutely no customer service? we all walked out without paying, and I will never go back here or to any other Buffalo Wild Wings for that matter.",
        "Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.",
        "Ambiance is a 5! Quiet and away from the bustle of E Carson St. BDC occupies the ground floor of a renovated row house. Tables are scattered over many rooms and an inviting outdoor deck. BDC serves Inteligensia coffee (like 21st Street). Oatmeal and gelato are also menu highlights.",
        "ATTENTION::\\nI was overbilled 2x n a month., I payed 1st & last month already.  , dont get fooled w/their 9$ special. I will never recommend this facilities to everyone.  They billed me 39$ for their maintenance watsoever. MANAGER doesn't know wat is  costumer service...",

        "What an awesome way to celebrate the Beatles music! This show was one big party! The 60's and Beatles lyrics inspired costumes were great, and I felt like the performers were having a fun time when they were dancing around. This show is definitely not typical acrobatics Cirque, but it was so enjoyable. In-line skating?? Only Cirque...",
        "Delicious offerings for tapas with friendly staff. Get with Kevin at the bar! The August happy hour 2 for 1 is a great deal. Check out the restaurant week special because it will be worth it! We liked everything we ate - 6 dishes between 2 people plus wine. The rabbit was fantastic. The crab & eggplant tapas was perfect. The egg dipped artichokes are a must! Get some friends and head over to the bar today.",
        "If Mickies was not on campus I am not sure if it would make it like it does but it fits perfectly into student world. Huge mounds of food for cheap and seat yourself atmosphere that makes this place feel perfect for any poor college student or alum who wants to pretend they are still in school. The fact that they do not take credit cards is a pain but only adds to the feel of the place. Somehow it all feels right at Mickies.",
        "My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",
        "We went in the 9:30pm show not knowing what to expect, and we were happily surprised. The show was entertaining with a wide variety of different acts. It's definitely an adult show with some non-family humor. The seatings are a bit packed together especially with the folding chairs seating that are a bit uncomfortable. Overall, the show is quite fun. Definitely a good show to see!",
        "I love this port of subs location. Its the best location I've been to by far. I understand that when your busy, you can't give the best costumer service. And I guess some people don't know the idea of pre-close?? Overall the food was great, the people there are awesome and I will surely come back soon.",

        "I ordered a Belgian waffle which was good.  My sister ordered the chicken strips and fries.  Her plate was mainly filled with fries.  My friend ordered a milkshake and we wondered where her silver mixing cup was with the rest of the milkshake.  Our waitress was a bit on the slow side and she was not very polite.  The food was good, the service could have been better.  It was funny looking at all the different outfits the employees were wearing.",
        "Please get courteous waitresses!  We dine there all the time in the evenings & those waitresses are kind & appear to be of Greek Nationality. Today we made the mistake & had lunch.  The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!",
        "Place is always good. I had the artichoke heart appetizer and it was quite tasty. Wine is expensive, as is the food, if you don't go during happy hour. But it's one of my preferred places to go to and people watch as I work on my books. Kelly was a great server, very attentive to providing quality wait service. This place consistently provides good food and service."

        "Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. \\n\\nThe pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. \\n\\nThe one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \\\"homemade\\\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.",
        "I love sephora, but my experience in this store makes me want to only shop online. I walked through the whole store and not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed assistance. And when I did have a question no one was around to help. I saw one employee not assisting anyone, but she avoided eye contact and appeared busy fixing products on the shelf. I left the store after that and I probably will not return.",

        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.

        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",

        "Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.",

        "As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.",
        "These stores are HUGE and there's never anyone in them. How they stay in biz is beyond me. Any who, there were plenty of workers around to try to help me find an anti-glare screen for my lappy 5000, but it turns out they do not sell this product anymore. Boo. Need a sharpie or a binder? Come here. Need anything beyond that? Call Amazon.",
        "I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill",
        "Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \\\"grunge\\\" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.",

        "The only thing this place loves is high prices. They clearly hate burgers. Food was greasy, cold and not worth even finishing. I hope this place closes sooner than later, there are way too many restaurants in Las Vegas that are overpriced and substandard that stay open because they rely on non repeat tourist business.",

        "Lovely, little place in a cool strip mall filled with neat businesses. Two medium sized portions were $10.82. My almond and bacio (hazelnut chocolate) was delish and filled with nuts.

Clean, neat operation with pleasant employees.",

Not a place I would recommend for someone to stay at. Advice; keep for a last resort.",
        "We visited this lounge/bar after being on their guest list for free entry on a Sunday night.  We didnt realize it was a hookah bar and was already frustrated with the smell of smoke all over Vegas. The music was whack and so was the crowd. We stayed about 10 minutes after taking a few pics on the cute little red chair you see right before you enter the bar, This definitely wasnt  our type of spot.",
        "This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.",

I have never really bought paint for a house before so I needed a little guidance. She helped me get the right type and mixed it for me. I had all my questions answered and was out of there pretty quickly. I had great service and was happy with the price I paid.",
        "Worst experience ever! Why does a hookah bar open at noon but won't serve hookah until 4 pm? Four employees here chatting and on their phones neglecting to help or even acknowledge other patrons. It's the end of December and their heaters outside don't work? Have been here for 45 minutes and not checked on once by any employee at all. Worst customer service experience in all of Vegas.",

        "This place is alright, there's just way too many bastard kids running around.  The only good thing about this mall opening is that it makes seeing a weekend night movie at the Esplanade a bit more pleasant, clearly this is the happening place to be for yuppie spawn and I couldn't be happier.",
        "Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.",
        "This is pretty average. A couple of friends and I stopped by right around closing time, and the nice hostess was really nice about taking us in, which we appreciated. Other than that nice gesture, all I can say is that their food was average and merits a 3 star review. From what I can see their service was comparable. Pretty good portions for the price paid!",
        "Typical Panda Express, but add a drive thru. Service is not exceptionally friendly, but lets face it, who cares. You have to deal with the employees for a whole minute and a half. Food is always good, portions are generally good, and close to shopping.",

So rude, will never go back!",

Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore.",
        "Free entry so it can't hurt to go! Make sure you go downstairs, its the Scottish section. Its a nice lay out, and some of the art is really interesting--like the one of doctors about cancer. Be warned though--there may be little kids putting crowns together on the floor when you go in!",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers.

The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.",

I will update my review if I ever do anything substantial here.",

I wasn't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal, it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do.  Thankfully, my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than I expected, with lots of fries on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus.",

        "M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.",

He and the other staff member on hand (I didn't catch his name) were super friendly and helpful the entire time. I will be returning for any other running needs I have!",
        "I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans.",

Tonight I placed my order and 3 min later I get a call that they are out of steaks and out of sweet potatoes.

        "Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!

I have been told many times the turnover of employees is because the management is awful and they treat their employees BAD!!!!!  Time to STOP supporting This place especially because there are SO many great sports bars with great staff!!!!!",
        "The overall experience was subpar. No greeting or direction on where to order when we entered. The burgers were cooked a little rarer than our tastes. The food in general was just average. Not much flavor. Smash Burger down the street is much better. And there's no need to make a comparison with 5 Guys. I don't see this place lasting long. The operation doesn't seem to be run smoothly either.",
        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "Horrible customer service. I understand the workers are helping customers out, but none greeted or asked if I needed help. I stood there for a good twenty minutes before leaving.

The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)",

        "Sad experience.  Went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for $10.99.  They only had 3 pieces of chicken.  That's not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left.  The employee made it pretty clear he wouldn't make more.",
        "The place was great looking and  the employees were great, but the food while plentful every item I had was lukewarm and average in both quality and taste.",
        "Terrible Service. Just left after waiting 20 min to get utensils and water. Was never given a menu. Another couple was seated with menus and the server commented that we were seated first but someone else would take our order. She then turned to the couple who had just been seated and took their order.  We got up and left.  Other tables had dirty dishes on it.  The restaurant wasn't even busy and I find this unacceptable for lunch hour."

The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks.",
        "Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas. We really enjoy the beet selection of my favorite beers was the Fullers ESB it's English and went perfectly with my meal. We were one very happy couple and will be returning soon .",
        "Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :)",
        "Love this place..always new things to see. Can spend hours here...always bring just a little bit of cash, or else I'll spend alot of money here",
        "Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\\n\\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "The best conference facilities I have been to in Phoenix.  Parking can get tight as another poster mentioned, but I think that is unavoidable.  The food is fantastic and they have snacks and drinks available during the day.  I don't like the tiny cups & water jugs to drink from.  I understand eliminating plastic bottles, but the cups they provide are too small.  Really a minor inconvenience though.",
        "Great espresso drinks crafted expertly! I haven't met the whole staff but, the redhead with the glasses provides awesome customer service. She's really friendly, not something you can expect from every coffee house (see: the 90's), and makes some damn tasty beverages. Nice decor, but I'm partial to sci-fi. I'd definitely return as long as awesome people like her work there!",
        "Episage turned out to be nicer than the address would otherwise suggest.   Her masseuse was Teri who did an amazing job.  My wife is planning to make another appointment on our next visit and request Teri.  My wife used a Groupon, but prices are very reasonable even without any form of discount.",
        "This is a great location on the strip - just a short walk to about any property you want. And the room rates are dirt cheap - $40 on the strip? OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "Wonderful little cheese shop with a variety of cheeses you've never heard of or heard of but never tasted. You can buy small pieces - orphans, they call them - so that you can taste without spending a bundle. There are gifts for foodies, too: jams, confits, crackers, etc. Really friendly staff and great sandwiches. Wish this had been around during my days at UW-Madison.",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",
        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "Great place to stay. Rooms are spacious and clean. The price is fair. It's at the end of the strip so there's less foot traffic which is a blessing. The air is cleaner vs other hotels. Lots of things to do in the hotel: beach, mall, bars, clubs, spa, many others.",
        "This is by far my number one go-to place when I'm in Vegas, if only for an hour or two. As of the time of my last visit, this was the only casino I visited where you can still gamble with actual coins! \\n\\nThere's nothing quite like the thrill of the clattering sound of dozens and dozens of nickels pouring out of a slot machine!",
        "I still enjoy Old Chicago after all this time.  Great place with lunch specials, good soups and always something FUN on Tap!   It feels like a true pub and places that seem few and far between these days. PS. They still have the PIZZA thing Down Pat!",
        "There is a time when the price you are charged gives an expectation for quality service and quality food. But stacks and yolks isn't a place of good value or good taste. The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug"

    "24": [
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Although this store is often mobbed with people, I still don't mind sifting through the masses to find a killer deal. The best part is that they hand out coupons as you walk in. The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store.",
        "The driver, Daniel, was early to the pickup, so there was no pressure on the drive. He was courteous and helpful. I called other cabs to compare prices and they were by far the cheapest to the airport. Great value indeed!",
        "Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",
        "The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "If that Beach burger wasnt SOOO GOOD!!\\n\\nCustomer service is out the window when it comes to this place. \\n\\nSometimes bad enough to where I'd just rather go to the million other places that serve burgers just as good or better with even better customer service.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "We visited this Sunday afternoon. There were three other pairs there and one person on the internet. The lattes were good. There were still a few pastries, but very little bread available. We wanted a sourdough, but no luck.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \\n\\nKey is to call ahead.\\n\\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.",
        "Overall, we got a great deal here.  Modern hotel and nice room.",
        "Having stayed at there other property The Venetian I was anxious to try The Palazzo.\\nSince is newer the Venetian is seem cleaner and more modern.\\nGreat rooms\\nThe casino is a little smaller.\\nThe staff is fantastic.\\nBeautiful decor throughout The hotel, check in was a breeze.\\nI had such a good trip I stayed there again two weeks later and also had a great time.",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "A lot of people love the Mirage... I'm not a big fan. \\n\\nI like it there. It's okay. It's in a decent location, it has some good restaurants, some bars and other things, it just doesn't tickle my fancy much. Maybe it's the middle-aged vibe? It feels older. The crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out.",
        "Deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries!  My boyfriend says its one of the BEST Italian beefs he has ever had.  I would like to see more on the menu, but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best BEEF!",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Wide, comfortable, reclining chairs perfect for cuddling and watching a movie?  Yes please!  So worth the extra $3 it costs over Harkins.",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.",
        "Waited 10 minutes in DT for 3 sandwiches that were cold when I got them, the Mexican in the window only told me to have a good day when I asked what took 10 minutes for me to get my food... 3 other cars that ordered all drove off before I got my food! Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and \\\"Mexican food\\\" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.\\n\\nI also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "Probably the worst chinese I've had in years. Sweet and sour had almost no sauce, and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew, not spicy at all. Not worth half what I paid.",
        "Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego.",
        "Tried them twice now, and as far as Italian goes, pretty bland.  Service was kind if stuffy too",
        "SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again.",
        "Came here with my family once and both my mom and I got food poisoning from eating here.  Not only that but I got it after eating a lasagna at a supposedly \\\"nice\\\" Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had to wait an hour to get into.  Thanks for the worse Vegas trip ever, at least the day I got sick and starting yacking everywhere was the day we left =/",
        "Service was great! Staff was very polite and we were seen right away. My daughter seen Dr. Hill who was very kind and made her laugh. Would recommend.",
        "Could be the most inefficient operation.  They had one guy moving cars and four other guys standing around. Took over an hour to get a wash, and that included no vacuum as well.",
        "Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience. This is a hotel that doesn't need to copy any other hotels.\\n\\nI recommend this great experience to all. Oh yea, lots of good looking people here...hehe.",
        "Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.",
        "After trying the sundance special for the very first time, I try so hard to try other items on the menu but I seem to always revert back to my Sundance Special! Love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast!",
        "We held a business dinner here following a tradeshow at the Mandalay convention center. The service here was top notch and the steaks were perfectly cooked. Exactly what you would expect this type of steakhouse. My coworkers who are a little bit older enjoyed it and were able to talk shop without all the vegas noise.",
        "We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!",
        "The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it.",
        "Took my daughter and her friend to get their nails and feet done.  The two of them had so much fun picking out what they wanted to do.  They chose ladybugs in a pink flower for the fingernails and ice cream cones for the toes.  She even put on SpongeBob on the TV for them too.  They had so much fun.",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "The girl at the mall hyped this place up soooo much when we asked her what was it to do in Charlotte. I was disappointed the theater only had a select few movies and I wasn't interested in any of the restaurants that is located there. It was just kind of Blah, but that's just me.",
        "Fantastic Pizza, wow!\\n\\nSo good.  Go get some authentic Italian Pizza!",
        "In town visiting a college on Jan. 3rd, 2013.  Hotel person recommended Oregano's so we thought we would give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Our waitress was very good - Sarah.  I had the turkey and provolone sandwich, my husband had the Italian sandwich and my daughter had the garlic chicken lasagne.  If we lived here we could eat there again but alas there is no Oreganos in Fresno, CA.",
        "Food: excellent\\nService: good\\nDecor: tasteful\\n\\nMy only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell in order to hear each other. It really ruined the experience.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "This is my first visit to this location, I have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening. The food was good , however the service was extremely rushed! The appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed. Not a very relaxing evening.",
        "Got the beef stew special. Was very good especially when you put Hawaiian chili pepper water all ova. Broke da mouth!! My sis had the teriyaki chicken & it was sweet tender & tasty :-)\\n\\nThanks Steven & Dawn for a good dinner :-)",
        "I had the free range chicken, which was ok.  Although it was very tender, I thought there was going to be more flavor.  The bar cheese bread was good.  The mussles were delicious.  The cheesecake was probably my favorite here.",
        "Went to there truck at Ces had a huge line so I was excited, took 35 minuets to come out and they got my order wrong! They got me a new plate fast and I think they hooked me up with extra meet. Beef was okay nothing special shrimp was good not over cooked. Fried rice tasty but little undercooked. Wasn't to original but meat was done right. I would go back if there wasn't a wait.",
        "We love this place. Hard to find a restaurant that my young boys like going to and enjoy the food. Wife and I are tired of Chili's.  The gelato is fantastic. The Italian Nachos are a must.  Wow! Something on the menu for everyone. Staff is very friendly and fun. \\n\\nStuffed!",
        "5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot.",
        "Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.",
        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "Not the biggest, baddest or hottest strip club in town but for a night out with my friends it was fun.  Plenty of good looking girls, not too pushy and very friendly.  Dances were decent for $10, some girls were much better at it then others.  Drinks were typically overpriced, just like any other strip club.  When there's another night out with the guys...I'll make sure to bring this place up again.",
        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. \\nemployee came and reprimanded her.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Nothing.\\n\\nLIKE  The spinach curry. The chicken cutlet. The sides offered. The pleasant service. The close proximity to other local favorite spots.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "If you are a fan of Legume in the previous location, you should definitely experience the restaurant in their new digs.  There is a wonderful spaciousness, plus the same attention to detail.  Really great food with a farm to table sensibility, creativity, and delicious food.  The other thing that is new is a fabulous wine list with lots of great and surprising choices.  Highly recommended.",
        "Lots of good markets in Madison, but Monona is good choice if you want to get in and out quickly.  Small, relative to other markets, but they've also got some a vendors including Java Cat (gelato) and Caf\\u00e9 Social (brewed coffee and beans)",
        "This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.",
        "Best steakhouse in Vegas. My wife and I come here almost everytime we are in Vegas and it is always amazing. We have tried all of the other top steakhouses on the strip but this place is much better with out the over doneness of the casinos and they dont rip you off. \\nSteaks are always cook perfectly and their sides are great.",
        "Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \\n\\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "Five stars is for food only !! Hands down best pastrami I've ever had. Maybe best sandwich period. I got the pastrami Reuben on sourdough. The gentleman on the meat sliding station let me sample the corn beef and pastrami to see which I liked better. He was very friendly but the two girls working the other counters were frowning and not friendly. .  I will def be returning on my next Vegas trip.",
        "This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.",
        "This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever tried to order from.  They take 2 hours to get you delivery, they always screw up the my order and they have no clue how to give good service.  Every time I've worked with them, they've screwed something up and they've never tried to make it right.  If Madison had any other food options, I would never order from them again.",
        "It's not fancy Asian food. But it taste great. I compare other Thai / Asian food to this place. Never had a bad experience or incorrect order.",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.\\n\\nDecent collards, however.",
        "Nice little place!  We had huevos rancheros with hand-made tortillas. Very nice family, their younger daughter serves.",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Every casino has a coffee shop/cafe, and this is NY NY's place.  A big restaurant and so far, I usually don't wait long to get a seat, unlike most of the other places.  I thought this is a bad sign, but was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing memorable here or to write home about, but the food is good and the menu is very adequate.  I would come back.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "Glad my husband and I decided to do brunch here. Really nice environment, friendly waiters and super yummy food. The french toast was so delicious. A little fancier than other breakfast places, they even brought out a foot stool for my handbag. I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town.",
        "Booked to inspect and repair some electrical issues. When I requested someone to come back because one light was still not working, I didn't get a response. Since that time, the other supposed fixes are not repaired.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "Overpriced just \\\"okay\\\" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint.",
        "Cheap food and booze? Im in!\\n\\nGot to love Firefly for many reasons besides the cheap dishes and booze! The atmosphere, people and servers make it all meld together perfectly.\\n\\nMost dishes here are delicious and the one i was particularly fond of was the lamb chops! Two for about $10?! Amazing! \\n\\nCheck out my Firefly food pictures among other on my Instagram! @dentalgaymer",
        "I don't understand why the bar/snack register does not have the candy readily available or on display. The bartender had to leave her station to walk halfway across the theater to get our order making us late for the movie. Then it was quite warm inside the theater, enough to make me uncomfortable throughout the movie.",
        "I have been coming to this location since it opened years ago and the only thing I can really complain about is the green tea latte.  Most times it's good but twice I have gotten it with the Matcha powder clumped in the bottom and clogging the straw. Not much grosser than drinking your tea and getting clumps of powder ever few seconds. Other than that, they are quick and its always clean.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops."

Hazel is a large Weimaraner Chocolate Lab mix and demands attention constantly.  Desert Dog Pet Care provides both food and comforting attention to Hazel.  Thanks Desert Dog Pet Care you ROCK!!!!!!!",
        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \\\"OK\\\"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.",
        "Industrial chic, great people, almost like having dinner at a friends house, only better. Great food! Amazing really. They use local and fresh ingredients. The menu is always changing.  The wine list is nice, and the craft cocktails have won me over... Especially that good \\\"Bourbon Lemonade.\\\" oh and the brunch is so good! The croque madam with a mango bloody Mary changed my life.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",
        "The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",
        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",
        "Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \\n\\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).",
        "If you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service Graze is the place for you.",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "The downtown location food is hit or miss. I don't know if it depends on who is cooking or what is happening. When you go on a 'good\\\" night the food is excelent otherwise it's just ok. This location does consistenly have poor service though especially on the patio.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!",
        "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "What a menu! So many things to choose from. The open face turkey sandwich was delicious. It was just like eating a homemade Thanksgiving dinner. Clam chowder was also great.\\nMy son has the cheesy cheese burger and fresh cut fries which he said was yummy.\\nWe'll be back.",
        "Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.",
        "I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \\\"smokers\\\" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.",
        "Grade: C-\\n\\nLess than average service. Almost okay food. Spendy.",
        "It ok not worth all the hype. No space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again .",
        "Great service!  Food tasted great too.",
        "Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better.",
        "My boyfriend and I love this place! Great mojitos and be ready to eat! Great lighting. Lots of room.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "decent... i had the \\\"sin city\\\" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers....",
        "Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Over priced!  But then again it is the Las Vegas strip!! Cool atmosphere, typical food.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \\n\\nKey is to call ahead.\\n\\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.",

        "way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?",
        "The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "No longer serving food :/ and not a huge selection of smoothies...\\n\\nStill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a VegasHot! class.",
        "Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk",
        "We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "While visiting with family in Las Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Mimi's since my uncle recommended it. We were not disappointed, the food and service were great! The pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome!",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",
        "The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.",
        "I've visited Fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that I've moved back to Phx.  Tasty and inventive food, good service, really nice atmosphere.",
        "Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review! Durango/215.",
        "Service was excellent, but food was just okay.",
        "Food presentation was great and the chips and salsa was really yummy. Actual meal was okay. I had the El Pastor tacos and husband had enchiladas. Not bad not great. Our waiter was just okay too. Won't go back",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "Bennys is like a old girlfriend, we've been through the best and the worst together. To start the best is food how the menu is so far and beyond anything around. But I have had hit or miss occasions and I've heard horror stories and glory stories so until consistency pervales  good luck",
        "No problems with food quality, I hear they are under new management. However, they have no condiment bar. I've never heard of a Quizno's that doesn't! I need my horseradish sauce, guys.",
        "This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it.",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.",

        "We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",

        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working",

Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",
        "Check-in was horrible , worst I have ever seen in LV. The managers and the check in people were unconcerned about 30 min to 1 hour check in , and even rude",
        "This place is hit or miss. I love the food, the menu has a great selection, however I have had some bad experiences here. I took my mom here one afternoon and the service was horrible, we sat at our table and waited forever before we even got water and when we finally got our food it was cold. I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again",
        "This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time",
        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.",
        "very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",

        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",

        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",
        "Do not go to the Sears on E Thomas Rd.  They missed two delivery dates, gave horrible customer service and were very rude. I finally gave up and cancelled my purchase of a washer and dryer. I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!",
        "So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!",

And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "This is my first sushi experience in Arizona and it was good, but nothing spectacular. The food is good, the service is decent and they would've gotten four stars, except the music that plays is SO annoying that it ruins the atmosphere of the place. Ambience is pleasing to the eye, but horrible on the ears.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "Just had the worst experience at this place the staff is rude there was 20 open tables 4 party sitting horrible service do not go...",
        "It wasn't horrible. The girl seemed like she couldn't be bothered and wanted to be else were. The guy was trying to be impressive with all his different topics. He was be over bearing and ignoying  to me. I wasn't  impressed by his conversations.\\n\\nThey job they did was standard.",
        "Ice tea is awful!  Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant!  Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service.",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \\nIt wasn't horrible.",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",

        "Walked by here for so long without knowing it exists.\\n\\nGlad I tried it since it's one of the larger coffee shops, it fits in with the street it's on as it's quieter than most coffee shops.\\n\\nLarge windows and varied seats and a little isolated area is pretty cool.\\n\\nI'm a Starbucks fan so the coffee is not my fave, but the price and selection are decent.",
        "Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location.",
        "Trash. The manager is spiteful and rude. Would rather see a table sit empty rather than seat it with a table of girls. Felt like we wouldn't be worthy of a table, even though I have money to spend here for a bachelorette extravaganza. Too bad. I'll never be back. Managment is horrible and would prefer to see an empty restaurant that a table of girls.",
        "Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it....\\\"I need to go to the bathroom...Hula's bathroom\\\". That's the restaurant across the street.\\n\\nBest laugh I had all night",
        "One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!",

        "Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel.",
        "I've been 4 times now.  I continue to have a \\\"meh\\\" opinion.  Food is OK.  Certainly overpriced.  Comparable in quality to other chain Italian joints but higher in price.\\n\\nThe service is always great and the happy hour is really nice.  Worth a visit but don't expect GREAT food.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "The girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant. She asked us how our weekend was going - a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience. The restaurant was very clean, which was confirmed by their 99.0 sanitation rating on the wall. Great place & we will definitely come back!",

        "Horrible service is an understatement.  Everything wrong. Lower your standards?",

        "I was so frustrated with so many furniture stores that have high pressure salesman and horrible customer service such as Ashley's. I came across Jack's Warehouse purely by accident and was pleasantly surprised. As promised, their customer service was outstanding. I felt very welcomed from the moment I stepped in the door to the delivery and set up which was equally as fabulous!",
        "Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone. When we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn't offer any solutions.",
        "So apparently 9 out of the 9 employees working today were new? They all were standing around with a confused look on their face. California Turkey was nothing special.",

        "Food is ok. Could definitely be better. Their gumbo is actually very good. It is not a very good place to have a casual drink. The layout is very poor and the bartenders are horrible. They don't work the bar and seem annoyed when people order a drink.",
        "We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.",
        "This place was horrible. Do not go here.",
        "I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure.",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",
        "went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!",
        "Well executed training - in just shy of 4 hours I earned my CPR, First aid and AED certificate.  Kari brought in real world anecdotes to supplement the videos.  Training equipment was excellent.  Only negative is the run down strip mall where the business is located - I was a bit concerned walking to my car late at night, but I am also unfamiliar with the area.  I would returned for further training.",

There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it.",

Park around the corner.\\n\\n--Too bad for the awful service here! Maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers.",
        "Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \\\"orange chicken\\\" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting.",
        "Horrible service but the food is good. I went to the Zipps on camelback all the time and was so excited when this one opened up in Glendale. Other than the food this is NOT the same restaurant. I always order my food to go to avoid the horrible management restaurant chain atmosphere and poor service. Disappointing.",
        "Horrible customer service.  I guess you shouldn't expect the cream of the crop, but halfway friendly wouldn't be bad.",

        "Great food! Great drinks! Great staff! The sangria was delicious. Our waiter was a sweetheart. Cabo Wabo at this point would have gotten 5 stars from me until I checked the bill. Cabo Wabo charges entertainment fees and or service fees aside from the auto gratuity. Strange and unusual, yes, but they still do it. \\nA great place for drinks and dining but always check your receipt for mystery fees.",
        "This is pretty average. A couple of friends and I stopped by right around closing time, and the nice hostess was really nice about taking us in, which we appreciated. Other than that nice gesture, all I can say is that their food was average and merits a 3 star review. From what I can see their service was comparable. Pretty good portions for the price paid!",
        "Terrible service.  Rude staff.  Horrible waitress.  Don't waste your time or money.  Plenty of better restaurants to select. Will never go back",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",

        "I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore.",

        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "This place is a dump!   Staff is rude, the owner just wants money, doesn't care about the quality of his programs or his staff.  The overall carelessness of the owner and staff is evident by the state of facility- its filthy and in need of maintenance.  Spend your money elsewhere, this guy doesn't need more lining his already deep pockets.",
        "Worst indian food. Total waste of money. Lunch buffet is $12 with only small selection of food. Chicken is the worst I ever had. Sweet dish ( gulab jamun) very strange taste.

I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",

I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)",

        "Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.",

Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry.",

When a place is that classy and yet seems totally laid back, it's a place to go back to!",

This place has no business calling itself Grimaldi's and should be ashamed! I love love love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, but this location does not even compare. If you are going to pay this much for pizza it better damn well be good!! Makes me very sad and I will NEVER go to this location again. No flavor.",
        "After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.",

There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",

        "When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there.",
        "The food was DELICIOUS!!!!!\\nI, too, like a couple of others mentioned, was a tad scared in that area. But, I think the food was worth the risk.",
        "Hubby and I wanted to warm up from the 30 degree weather so pho seemed like a good idea. Service was good. Restaurant was clean and pretty busy. I didn't really enjoy the pho with beef slices. It had a weird sweet after taste. I've tasted a lot of pho in my day. And I just didn't care for it. My husband enjoyed the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce. Sorry, I can't find a reason to go back.",
        "I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself",
        "Tried to get a table. On a Wednesday had a ridiculous wait because they wouldn't seat a table of two at a table for four. (75 minutes with tables for 3-4 sitting open!!!!) it's summer in phoenix! What are they waiting for to put butts in their seats. No matter. I left and went to Stingray who got me in with no incident at 7pm.",
        "This used to be my favorite bbq place in Charlotte, but the last several times the pork has been very fatty. Sorry Midwood, Mac's and Queen City Q have you beat. P.S. 3-stars because the beef brisket is very tasty.",
        "Attended the Sammy Hagar event 10/18/14\\n\\nONE HOUR BEER LINES!!! Absolutely unacceptable for Vegas standards. It's run by the owner of the \\\"D\\\" so the \\\"D\\\" must stand for dysfunctional. \\n It has potential but I have no intentions to ever return. I could have drove home and got a beer out of my fridge before we were served here.",
        "Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)\\n\\nI had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)",
        "Love the food, but am VERY disappointed that I was charged 1.50 for a refill, when every other time I have been to Which Wich, it was only .50  I don't understand how they can get away with charging different prices.  It seems to me that the price should be the same nationwide...and I have been to several different locations nationwide...all only charged .50 !  This will definitely affect my decision about how often to come here.",
        "I don't care how you dress this place up, its still a fake Denny's. I know a Denny's when im in a Denny's and this is a damn Denny's called the Pyramid Cafe at the Luxor.\\n\\nStop Lying Vegas! Stop Lying!",
        "Found a great dress, but when I was trying it on, the fitting room attendant opened the door on me (without knocking) and I had to slam it shut. Mind you, it was the same attendant who let me in that room less than 5 minutes before. No apology, nothing. They definitely need customer service training here.",
        "I really like this place. Great selection of meats and Latin products with quite a nice produce section as well. I got a tad upset when one of the butchers didn't speak English but when the other one noticed he took over and was pretty helpful. All in all a nice little market.",
        "hahahaah.....$7.77 all day. Where can you find else in the States?\\nThey served Chinese food, Italian food, American Food, etc. There's nothing special but with that price, what can you blame about?!\\n\\n*p.s. the bread pudding there is so good.....lol",
        "Apparently they don't have room for new customers, but they do have a list of competitors you can have but they don't know how well these guys work so that's really of no use. Sorry you're too busy! I'll find my own company.",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction",
        "Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards...",
        "I went to this place for lunch. It was a little crowded, but the service was still fast and friendly. Our food came out quickly, and it tasted very good. It actually had a medium amount of spice like we requested, unlike some places where even the mild is still uncomfortably spicy. Everything tasted very good, and was a reasonable price (we ordered from the lunch menu). I'll be going back.",
        "Disgusting!!! Walked-In for service -- took few looks and left. Walked into restroom to wash my hands and filth all over the walls. Did not appear sanitary at all. This is my first Yelp review as I was that grossed out and wanted to warn y'all... Ick ick ick!!!",
        "Tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am I disappointed. Usually I really enjoy eating here at least once a week. Tonight I placed my order and 3 min later I get a call that they are out of steaks and out of sweet potatoes. I know this is not a major issue but to me if you are a landrys affiliated establishment this is unacceptable. \\nI WILL not be ordering from claim jumpers for a long time now.",
        "I was in this location for lunch.  Shockingly, on going to the condiments station for some napkins and straws, there were ants all over the entire island!  In reporting this disgusting infestation to the manager, the manager stared back at me with a blank stare, as if she was confused or amused by our report.  Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.  This should have never happened and this manager should have take much more decisive action to fix the problem immediately.",
        "Fast service , great food, and excellent beer. Beeeeer. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeer. They should stay open later though. 10:30pm on a thursday is unacceptable for being  the only place walking distance from the hotels that serves alcohol.",
        "Excellent food and service.  Only mistake chef made was there was a piece of plastic paper slipped into the coffe from the kitchen.  Manager apologized and gave us free dessert. However, it was pretty dangerous that we almost drank in that plastic paper..",
        "It is alright. My buffalo chicken pizza was tangy but not spicy, but still pretty good. The beer selection is pretty great. The service was pretty terrible but the manager came out and apologized for the shabby service and comped my pizza so kudo's for that. I felt the atmosphere was cold and uncomfortable and the design was definitely done by some company who shouldn't be designing restaurants. Ill go back and give it another shot before i write this one off.",
        "The Cake Boss should be ashamed of his store. The service was horrible and we never had any cake. We waited 45 mins.",
        "Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,",
        "wow. this is the worst place I ever order food from. 1st the food came cold, & when spoke to the manager Joey he said - WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST,  then he insulted me, & was as unprofessional as a manager could be. He thinks making excusing & insulting people is part of saying sorry. I would tell everybody do not order from this place, as long as this guy is in charge. He is a joke of a mamager.",
        "Terrible Service. Just left after waiting 20 min to get utensils and water. Was never given a menu. Another couple was seated with menus and the server commented that we were seated first but someone else would take our order. She then turned to the couple who had just been seated and took their order.  We got up and left.  Other tables had dirty dishes on it.  The restaurant wasn't even busy and I find this unacceptable for lunch hour.",
        "When I asked a employee for help with shoes he tried to run off and not help me. If you are busy just say so I will not get offended by that. Just tell me so.",
        "Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!",
        "Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.",
        "Their burgers are pretty good when not dark pink inside, great topping and sauce selection. One negative thing - I am assuming that their water tastes pretty bad, bad enough to affect the taste of the Pepsi products they serve. I've tried Pepsi, Mug rootbeer and Sierra Mist. They all have a funny aftertaste.  I would give them 5 stars if I were confident that they were cooking their burgers properly and they fixed the bad tasting soda issue.",
        "Just got off phone with service manager, they returned my vehicle to me with a coolant hose disconnected. Service manager said \\\" sorry but my tech did nothing wrong, must of been miscommunication between my wife & service advisor\\\"... Really, this is how your manager handles my survey complaint?",
        "Decent coffee for what's located in a hotel that was off the strip. Without driving off to get Starbucks, this place is definitely liveable when you walk your butt down the elevators after a drunk night or a night of betting.",
        "Cons: Price (garlic bread is 6 dollars), small portions, poor service. We had a 9:30pm reservation for dinner (group of 4) - we didn't get seated until well after 10pm with no apologizes. \\n\\nPros: Good food, nice place.\\n\\nOverall: the food is good but not really worth the poor service, high prices, and long wait times, especially when there are so many other great restaurants around.",
        "I'm pleased with my experience here. They altered my wedding gown which was an extremely delicate chiffon beaded gown by Tadashi Shoji. Its pricey, but the craftsmanship is excellent  and that might be worth the peace of mind. Its run by a husband and wife and they could not be nicer people. \\nMy only complaint is that they are soooo far from where I live!",
        "Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!",
        "I am sorry to say but it's the worst indian food I have ever had. The food is not fresh and tasted as if it was from previous day's buffet. I am from india and can tell easily by eating indian food if it's fresh or not. Waste of money at this place.",
        "This is a convenient place to meet and eat. I had a business meeting over lunch which worked out well since the restaurant seems to drown out some of the casino noise and the ambient music. I had the chicken quesadilla which tasted good except for the guacamole which was horrible. The portion was a tad on the small side but it is considered an appetizer and reasonably priced.",
        "The show was INSANE! Fun times! Don't go if you are easily offended. spectacular must-see show. I've see many shows in Vegas and this was one of the best. I laughed so hard my face hurt.  Seats are unassigned and not very comfortable, but who cares, you will be on edge all the time anyway!",
        "I come here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to see the funny faces people make when they taste some of the samples of Coca-Cola from around the world. \\n\\nIt's funny. Damn funny. I was a sucker once and did it. I regretted it immediately .\\nIf ya want to know what piss tastes like, try the coke from Italy. NASTY. \\n\\nFour stars for the free, hilarious entertainment.",
        "I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!",
        "Dr Sikand sent me to have a lump diagnosed for cancer but they ordered the wrong test. They told me I had to have another test but they weren't sure if my insurance will pay for it. 2 weeks later they still don't know. Their lack of communication and failure to order testing correctly is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone.",
        "I went there last week it wasn't even busy I waited 15 plus min and no one came to take my order! I had to walk out of this joint   It should be ashamed to be have a location on old town and piss people off and run their business like an amateur little kids! I hope you guys shut down very soon!",
        "Most likely will not visit again. Overpriced for what you get. Slow service and cold food is unacceptable when there was one order before us.",
        "I hate this place.  Why is ok to degrade Buddhist statues but never say a word about the virgin mary.  I am offended at the cultural appropriation and not to mention their billboards make me sick.  I love sex and I love love Vegas, but keep my religion out of it!\\n\\nThe food also is not that good, nor the cocktails.  If you are from CA, try the Geisha House in Hollywood.  It is amuch classier version.",
        "Not a fan. Do not go to Casino Royale in Vegas. This is a sham! They will promise you game play and it is impossible to make it happen under their guidelines. Then, they will simply apologize and tell you there is nothing more they can do for you. The best part is you have to run a $20 through their machines first and get or to a zero balance before their $20 will kick in...",
        "Just got my brows and lip done and all I have to say is wow!! Totally professional environment and so modern inside. I have really weird shaped eyebrows that pose a challenge for many estheticians but they were shaped perfectly here. My esthetician (forgot her name I'm sorry) even showed me how to correctly fill them in afterward. Reasonably priced for such a great job!",
        "i don't really like buffets.  but my family LOVES them.  so i have seen a buffet or two in my decades here on earth.\\n\\non a recent trip to vegas we hit up this buffet for the champagne brunch and all i can say is DAMN!  if every buffet could be like this one i would be a convert.  it was super, duper yummy.  the selection was huge, the food was fresh, and the service very good.",
        "Food is delicious as always but waited one hour 23 minutes to get our food. When we inquired at an hour and fifteen they said the chef said it's coming. Acted like it was no big deal. An off-hand apology that wasn't convincing. For the price wen paid for dinner I expect more! \\nVery disappointed tonight. Can't decide if it's worth coming back.",
        "Good wine selection but the dude named Paul asked me if I need wine glasses or am I going to drink it out of the bottle.  Hu!  I have wine glasses thank you.  Rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless it's a bad joke, probably but still inappropriate.",
        "A disappointment. Chicken finger dinner consisted of two pathetic chicken strips and soggy fries. Bf had the catfish and was not blown away by it. Nothing was that great. we tried this place before and we were no impressed either times. Only decent thing was the okra.  Sorry Cajun Seafood Corner but this just isn't going to work between us.",
        "Phenomenal BBQ! We had the brisket sandwich and the Smokin Plate. Everything exceeded our expectations. I'm only sorry that we don't live closer!",
        "This place is overrated.  It was fine but not at all special, not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good.  Sorry.\\n\\nConsidering how many great restaurants there are in Vegas, there is no reason to come here.",
        "Packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria. Called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 PM. Pulled up at 7 PM and they said sorry we are closed.",
        "Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.",
        "Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service",
        "Pricy but food was not as good as before , we had this 40 year old lady serving us and she didn't do well...gave us the wrong check and went back to blame on the cashier when she was the one grabbing the wrong check..I heard it all..won't go back again",
        "Since writing this review I've received two e-mails from Sushi Samba employees suggesting I return and that they are genuinely sorry that I had a bad experience and are sure it won't repeat.  \\n\\nMy question is:  Where was this level of service when I was eating there?\\n\\nLike hell I'm going to spend another hundred something dollars for them to prove to me that they don't suck.",
        "Terribly long wait. It's like they didn't know that anyone was coming to Las Vegas today. They seemed to have more employees than people waiting in line as they were doing a shift change that took about 1 hour.  Someone else commented that it was like the Post Office and they were exactly right.  They just don't give a damn.  Rent somewhere else no matter how much it costs!",
        "We ate here 12-25-2012. Just now catching up with all my reviews! This place is fantastic. My daughter son in law and I flew into vegas for xmas and met my dad and step mom here for dinner and it was great. I had the beef wellington which was perfect. Everyone else had some kind of cut of steak and they all loved it. Sorry cant get more specific too much time passing! Service was great too.",
        "Sorry... not as good at Fairmount! The all-dressed bagel was as good as naked, with no salt to be found.",
        "This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome.",
        "Ew. There's always a blonde girl working in the kitchen with her hair down and I found a piece of hair in my food. I'm sorry but that's just gross. Also there was flies everywhere. The place has potential but needs to work on a few things",
        "Ehh not worth my time or $$ \\nI rather go to El gordo and get my tacos \\n\\nIdk about their rice dish but the meat on my tacos is the big thing here..  so I would say it ain't all that .. \\n\\nWon't come back again I'm sorry.\\n\\nThis place takes forever to make my orders and I was not satisfied.",
        "I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back.",
        "This place visually is nice, as far as the attitude of staff and service don't expect too much unless you are the money mogul type. This place is ran by old school people that still lives in the 1930's. They try to pass off as if they are hardcore bad asses or something, especially on the craps tables.\\n\\nI am sorry to say but this place is stuck up, but hey, i guess it is to be expected that's life.",
        "Another trip to Vegas, another trip to McCarran.  \\n\\nI don't hate it, but its never going to be one of my favorite airports.  I just don't understand why they don't open their security check points till almost 5am?!?

        "When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!",
        "Worst manicure I've had in years. He filed all my nails short without asking me. The polish was all over my skin around my nails and cuticles and, because it was red, it stained my skin. Do not recommend.",
        "My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "I had fun here while I was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home. Great variety of dishes. One step up from the hometown buffet/golden corral type buffets.",
        "Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.",
        "From the first time we stepped into the place until the time we drove away, it was nothing but organized and friendly. \\n\\nEveryone was great. \\n\\nThe food was good, just watch for the precooked burgers in the \\\"juice\\\" if you have time ask for a fresh cooked one. prices were very reasonable.",
        "Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "The Sunset Caf\\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff.",
        "They close the Hilton Honors lounge on the week ends. Very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge. Very unusual for a Hilton , seems to be a mini Hilton in many respects. Not what I am use to in services, for a Hilton would be ok as a Best Western and the rates should then be lower.",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location.",
        "Went to dinner with my girlfriend the other night and had a fabulous dinner here. The ambiance is lovely and the Mediterranean cuise was varied and delicious. I was also pleased to see when the bill didn't break the bank. I highly recommend this cute little restaurant for a pleasureable dining experience at a great price.",
        "Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\\n\\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.",
        "If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of.  And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass.  Wtf!?  This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus?  Will not be coming back.  Get it together .",
        "Fries where not good at all. Kind of mushy and weird seasoning. They charge for ranch. The burger was nothing to brag about. I had to ask for ketchup. Coupon made it worth a try- tricky parking lot to pull our of to make a left hand turn.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. \\n\\nYou have to see this if you are in Vegas!",
        "We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice.",
        "Second to Hurley's for good pub grub on lunch. Fish n Chips - with really tasty chips. Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office.",
        "By far, THE BEST breakfast buffet in Vegas. They've got it all.\\n\\nBenedict, Crepes, eggs, all meats, wonderful desserts. I would not suggest this buffet at dinner time, but for lunch, you CAN NOT MISS IT!",
        "As an Italian, I eat way too much pasta. I was a bit skeptical trying out a place that makes \\\"fresh pasta\\\" since we do it fresh at home but this place is definitely worth your time and money. The pasta is very fresh, the sauces are quite tasty and the people working there are super helpful. I would suggest this place if you're having guests over and want to make something super quick and good!",
        "Phoenix House Painting just completed a complete exterior repaint of my home and I couldn't be more pleased.  I highly recommend them.  The owner, John Morris, is a veteran of the paint industry.  The guys that work for him are smart, efficient, careful and quick. My home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials. Stop by and take a look.  They are the best !!!",
        "The location is perfect. It's in downtown Phoenix and connected to Z Pizza! They offer a variety of items to choose from: breakfast food, ice cream, baked delicacies, etc.\\n\\nThe downside is that it's dark in there. It feels kind of depressing. There is not very much parking.",
        "This place is ghetto assf#*k! There are methers, prostitutes and scum that frequent this place, they do offer a AAA discount that brings the total to around $50 after tax. If you need a place to stay this will do, just don't leave your valuables in your vehicle.\\n\\nGood luck",
        "Safeway's are great now..  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good, fresh sushi, good sandwiches and wonderful soups... since i work in the area i eat lunch there alot and am happy with the price and selection...",
        "Omg this was awesome! The only thing missing is tri tip. If they started smoking that, mmm... Mmm. They would have it made! Chelsea was our waitress. She was amazing. So funny and on top of her game! I would absolutely come here again and ask for her again!",
        "This place was amazing! Impeccable timing out to order to table time with hot fresh is housed. The sauces are awesome. The ambiance is clean cannot say enough good things amazing specials lunch is only $5.99 with the drinks which is also just awesome!",
        "I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\\n\\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "\\\"Perfect Place to Have Breakfast and Lunch!\\\"\\n\\nThis restaurant is the perfect place to have a late breakfast and lunch. The food is always fresh and tasty.

        "I had a short wait on my visit to Dr. Harris and the staff was helpful in getting all my paperwork done. The Dr. was awesome, very personable and knowledgeable. They have a streamlined system and set me up the very next morning with bloodwork.\\n\\nI had my results available through their phone system 24 hours after that.\\n\\nNice, helpful staff, and good doctors is almost all you can ask for in a clinic.",

        "I just found this site looking for moving quotes the other day. It was dope. I filled out the form and all these movers started hitting me up with quotes. It took me about a week to organize them all, but when I finally did I realized I probably saved about a thousand bucks. It is just like orbitz or cheap tickets but for moving quotes. pretty cool i thought.",
        "They offer a good variety of food and most of it is OK but nothing is really good. The best thing I had there was the Wonton Soup and it was not the best I've had by a mile. I did go for lunch so maybe the dinner buffet is better but I would avoid it as the Chinese Restaurant is much, much better than this and with less people.",
        "Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone. When we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn't offer any solutions.",
        "Capo's on Sahara is delish! The pastas are yummy and service was great. The meat is cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. The ambiance is perfect for friends or a date.",

        "$7 for a 2oz container of guac with chips. Don't ask the rude bartender for a water refill he will tell you to get it yourself.  Guess he thinks there is no tip in getting a customer a refill on water when the servers are really busy.\\n\\nFood was good but don't be in a hurry.  There was not enough staff on duty to meet demand.",
        "Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person.",
        "Episage turned out to be nicer than the address would otherwise suggest.   Her masseuse was Teri who did an amazing job.  My wife is planning to make another appointment on our next visit and request Teri.  My wife used a Groupon, but prices are very reasonable even without any form of discount.",
        "I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure.",
        "Been coming here since 1986. Hands down, the best Mexican food in town. I'm in the Air Force and have lived all over the country. I have yet to find Mexican food anywhere else that can compare to Popo's.  Every time I come back to Phoenix for a visit, Popo's is the first stop I make. Excellent rice! Don't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips!",
        "It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!",
        "The effin service sucks!! All 3 servers were rude, never smiled and when I would ask for something they would just walk away.. I would never come back to this place.. Crab is so salty n what I said b4 SERVICE SUCKS!!!!",
        "The pizza is great and it's so original! The price is good and the food is great. But don't ask them for ranch it will highly offend them, they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza. The cheese is amazing!",
        "Spend time there several times, even bought some Groupons, but lately the wait staff is not very attentive. You have to ask for refills and no name introduction or real eye contact. Drinks are good...Chris the bartender is the exception as he actually talks to you and makes great drinks.",
        "Great food, great service, great atmostphere. What more can you ask? Equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal.",
        "Good, fast food.\\n\\nI stop here every so often when I'm walking on Craig for an inexpensive, but filling meal. Go for the sub combos, easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it!",
        "Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it.",
        "So good! We stopped in for a couple scoops of ice cream and were not disappointed. The toasted coconut is delicious. It's creamy, flavorful, and I thought the serving size was fair. The Vietnamese coffee was also great. If you're a coffee fan, I highly suggest trying it.\\n\\nThe shop is really cute with lots of candy for sale. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.",
        "My boss was visiting from Texas and we wanted to get a decent breakfast so I found this place...I would only suggest the signage be a bit better as I had to go around twice and then ask someone where it was as it's upstairs.  Once up there this is fabulous and the service was great.",
        "Best pizza available in the NW/Centennial area.  The ambiance is still developing but the food is great.",
        "Only 8 calories an ounce for yummy creamy indulgence that won't have the buttons popping off your shirt! They have flavors that rotate and for the full fat full flavor seekers they serve Thrifty ice cream as well. I personally feel their small is big enough. Open late, friendly too. Ask for a sample as some flavors are great and others to me are just so so.",
        "Love this place! So glad that I decided to come here with my friend. Ask for Summer or Kate, they are fabulous and friendly! Love my mani pedi and definitely will be coming back to this cute little place.",

        "Worst service. \\nThe host was to personal. \\nMy silverware was dirty and had food on it.\\nDon't think this place is safe to eat.\\nThe waitress was not friendly and didn't explain the specials they offer. The waitress took 8 minutes for our drinks and they weren't even busy. The food came out warm not hot. She took a 30 minutes to bring the food. I think all their locations have gone down hill.",
        "Ok! So the music was great!!! Had fun dancing the whole night, but unless you plan on getting bottle service then you won't be able to see the stage. Drinks are very expensive.",
        "Had the pork chile stew, very good.  Large portion size, make sure to ask for the bread, it is very good as well.  Great atmosphere and wait staff.",
        "No, it's not MGM or Mandalay Bay. It is a good buffet for the money. The lunch buffet had a lot of good options. They have Middle Eastern, Asian, Mexican, Italian and American standards. For $35 you can get three buffets in a day. I wouldn't suggest it, but you could!",
        "Small, intimate venue for shows/concerts in the middle of downtown. The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of \\\"stadium\\\" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!",
        "Jim Barker, Debbie Wilson and Ashley Ford.  Avoid!  My loan went pass the date and the sellers are pissed and put in a 3 day cure notice.

I know it's Home Depot, but the least you could do is introduce yourself when you pick up a phone call instead of just saying, \\\"hullo.\\\" And don't respond with \\\"yeah, of course!\\\" when we ask you if it's Home Depot because you didn't tell us where we were calling in the first place.",
        "Awesome experience. Price point was great. They offered a free checked bag and wine and a snack on the flight. Who could ask for anything more.",
        "Edit:  I don't like this place anymore!  Last experience- the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want (and so less pad thai).  Also service was really slow for lunch.  It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares."

        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.

        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",

        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",

Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",

        "I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!",
        "Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much.",
        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it.",
        "Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "Nailbarllc is the best in town. They do an excellent job and the team is great.  Lana, Hieu,  Ivy, Katie. ...love them all! I highly recommend and would not go anywhere.  I am a client for life:-)",
        "I didn't wanna write a review but since 2 days late ,still feeling bad from the clam pizza....I'd have to say this place is no good.",
        "Finally there is a good Indian restaurant in Henderson/Las Vegas with amazing service!  I spent months traveling in India and know what the dishes are supposed to taste like and that there is supposed to be some actual flavor involved.  The Taj Palace does not disappoint and is able to deliver authentic Indian food - not the bland stuff served in the majority of other restaurants in LV.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",
        "Check-in was horrible , worst I have ever seen in LV. The managers and the check in people were unconcerned about 30 min to 1 hour check in , and even rude",
        "Always love going to CPK. There three of us. The salad and spaghetti was excellent. Took awhile to get served, bread and a waitress. She was looking right through me as I recited my order, was slow and just not interested. I'd still go back though.",
        "I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.",
        "I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old.",
        "We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.",
        "I love this place and so do my kids!  Tonight I went for fishing gear for the kids.  This is an area I know nothing about.  Brad in the fishing department was very friendly and very helpful.  He spent a good 10-15 minutes with me helping me to pick out the right trout fishing equipment.   Thanks Brad!\\n\\nThis place caters to kids with activities for them on Tuesday nights and occasionally on weekends.  Check out their website.",
        "This place is great-only thing was we couldn't get a table in the outside patio!! It was a Friday night though-still had a great time. Get there early on weekends to get a good seat. Great local and non-local spot. excellent beer choices. don't plan on eating.",
        "Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience. This is a hotel that doesn't need to copy any other hotels.\\n\\nI recommend this great experience to all. Oh yea, lots of good looking people here...hehe.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",
        "We held a business dinner here following a tradeshow at the Mandalay convention center. The service here was top notch and the steaks were perfectly cooked. Exactly what you would expect this type of steakhouse. My coworkers who are a little bit older enjoyed it and were able to talk shop without all the vegas noise.",
        "I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\\n\\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\\n\\nWe will definitely stay here again.",
        "Decent venue, well run, drinks are about what you'd expect. Overall you need to go when there is a good DJ, we had some second rate DJs who aren't local, but aren't good. It was a fun time, but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "We couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the delicious food!! Loved everything about this place. Great way to end a day of strolling around old town Scottsdale. Perfect date spot!!",
        "Super super slow. Expect a 15 minute wait in the drive through and about 50% if the time the food is cold or old.",
        "This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "Food: excellent\\nService: good\\nDecor: tasteful\\n\\nMy only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell in order to hear each other. It really ruined the experience.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!",
        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",
        "Yesterday, the SCOTUS granted Hobby Lobby its petition that it be treated as a person, with religious beliefs and religious freedoms, and the ability to deny its employees equal access to healthcare. Just as Hobby Lobby can now pick and choose which equal rights it wants to support, I can pick and choose never to shop there ever again.",
        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus.",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",
        "WOW! that pretty much could be all that needs to be said for this review, but that would be lame! \\nZumanity A+. I have seen this show once before and i was blown away then. This time even knowing what to expect, STILL blown away.\\nThis show is for the dirty minded only! =) The show is done in good taste, not like a straight out strip show. The comedy in the pre-show and throughout is just the best.",
        "i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it",
        "Waste of time and money. May be kids might like it but really the blue man group's talent is not derived from them but the band playing in the back drop. The band was excellent but blue man themselves a Big disappointment. Please don't spend money on premium seating.. Category A, if u do land up going cheap seats will do.",
        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",
        "Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a \\\"ladies lunching\\\" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.",
        "I like this place and agree with everyone else...\\n\\nThe crawfish was yum.  The seasoning was perfect with the perfect amount of spice.  Thank you for the gradual scale of spicyness.\\n\\nCan I get some wet wipes or something though?\\n\\nService is kind of slow.  It was busy but you would think they would compensate with more than one or two servers on a Friday night.",
        "I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat",
        "Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.",
        "I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "Good place to watch a game, but I would never go there for anything else.  The menu is totally sports-bar-esque and the food was greasy.  Good place if you're hungover and want to watch the game.  Otherwise... ummm... no thanks.",
        "This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!",
        "The Linq is a \\\"mini strip\\\" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "I never thought I'd like poutine, and I certainly don't want to eat it every day, but this stuff was really good. Get it with some bacon or sausage on top. Excellent for teenage boys.",
        "Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!",
        "Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\\u00e9s. Portions g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!",
        "Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the \\\"Motor\\\" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",
        "From the first time we stepped into the place until the time we drove away, it was nothing but organized and friendly. \\n\\nEveryone was great. \\n\\nThe food was good, just watch for the precooked burgers in the \\\"juice\\\" if you have time ask for a fresh cooked one. prices were very reasonable.",
        "It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!",
        "Can't review this place as I walked in and was told a 45 minute wait. I am sure the food must be good but I honestly won't wait 45 minutes for anything to eat. No matter how good something is there always is another option...this time it was Feast Buffet at Santa Fe.",
        "I went back for more... stir fry and bahn mi this time. Both were excellent... great proportions making it an excellent value. Awesome flavor. The people running this place are extremely nice. The bahn mi was even better than the one I get it Da Vangs, which is saying a lot since that place is still my #1 favorite for spring rolls and pho.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",

        "Great new Szechuan option. Very authentic. Try the cold appetizers (not on the menu) and the spicy boiled beef.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",
        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",

        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.

I left the store after that and I probably will not return.",
        "see the waitress?  see her ignore you?  see a bartender ?  good luck if you can find one...maybe they are hiding somewhere?  big points on the art and decor, the music is usually stellar, but the service is really lacking.  there is a really good selection of beer, somewhat pricey.  the hummus is really good.  oh but why is the Indian serving the naked goddess on the painting above the bar?  that will have you stumped for hours!",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",

I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",

I understand this place's forte' is rock memorabilia, they should at least provide palatable food, not saw dust. They would be better off serving TV dinners. Stay away from this place. if you must go, then just have some appetizers and leave.",

It is not just talk, they have some things set up.  As the the main priority.  I have seen a lot of doctors over the last few decades and I can recommend Dr. Moody without reservation.",
        "The ham and cheese croquettes are delicious.  The meatballs were okay.  The artichoke appetizer was okay.  With so many options to choose from, I will go back and try more.  But, I will have the croquettes again.",
        "Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person.",
        "Episage turned out to be nicer than the address would otherwise suggest.   Her masseuse was Teri who did an amazing job.  My wife is planning to make another appointment on our next visit and request Teri.  My wife used a Groupon, but prices are very reasonable even without any form of discount.",
        "We visited this lounge/bar after being on their guest list for free entry on a Sunday night.  We didnt realize it was a hookah bar and was already frustrated with the smell of smoke all over Vegas. The music was whack and so was the crowd. We stayed about 10 minutes after taking a few pics on the cute little red chair you see right before you enter the bar, This definitely wasnt  our type of spot.",
        "Normally I'm a cool headed person but when you manage to mess up two flights and then proceed to lose my carrying you insisted needed to go under the plane. I think I have a fair reason to be upset. I understand things happen but when I have been in three cities and each person I tried to speak with was incompetent and unable to get anything done I tend to get a little upset. Sorry but you have officially lost my business forever.",
        "I was disappointed.   My shrimp showed signs of freezer burn.  Not up to the standard i expect from Bubba Gump.",
        "The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\\n\\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.",
        "Nice place.really busy so very hard to get appt. Or walk in. Clean and friendly. Hope it slows down so I cam get in more often. How do they remember everyone's name?! Lol",
        "So in love with this place I decided to have my husband's retirement party here on a Thursday night.  I tried to plan something out and then decided to just have everyone show up.  We ended up with 40+ people who had a blast playing games, listening to the band, drinking, eating and just hanging out.  Kids are allowed in until around 10 so it was nice to have them be able to attend.  THE perfect night!!",
        "This place is terrible! The waiting time is ridiculous. My initial visit was 2 hours with a $50 fee. For what? Just a few simple vital signs that I could have taken myself. I am a regular at their Charleston location and I love it. I am in and out of there in less than 5 minutes. But today, I have been waiting for my BC Pills for over an hour. Flamingo location is NOT RECOMMENDED! And the staff is rude too.",
        "This may be my favorite week night restaurant. The olive appetizer is my favorite, and the best olives I've had in my life. Ever. I get the sandwich with roast beef, muenster cheese and horseradish pretty regularly and cannot eat it fast enough it's so good! They also have great craft beers on tap!",
        "All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I.",
        "great stuff, great service.\\nbought about 12 shirts at half price of Macy's and some awesome mouth and shin guards!\\nSuch a deal!",
        "Really poor service, I fixed an appointment for test driving 2 cars. After being made to wait for over 90 minutes, they informed me that one of the cars has been sold and the other one cannot be found. Worst experience ever",
        "Absolutely the worst choice for our first meal in Vegas. This place is completely overpriced and the staff was inattentive. Miguel seemed annoyed we didn't want to order right away, but chose to enjoy an appetizer first. The sushi is about the same as the local convenience store. I would rate it zero stars.",
        "I went to see the waving cowboy the one in the opening seen the the old TV show \\\"Vegas\\\" I think its Seen better days. It has some old Vegas Charm but its Ghetto. Note to city of Vegas if don't want this place to totally die get one of those monorails to DT! Maybe better at night ill try to give it another chance.",
        "Definitely needs a major renovation update....! Popcorn ceilings, damp smell upon arrival in room, bedsheet covers are what you will see at great great grandma's house, you get the vibe this place does not feel clean at all, towels are thin & off-white color, parking cost $15 with in & out privileges. The only good things are FREE wi-fi and Lucie at front desk was friendly & informative.",
        "I took my car there yesterday after it stalled at a red light. The staff there greeted me almost immediately and ran a test on the car. He identified the problem and was able to fix it right away. I was in and out within ptetty quickly considering. Very professional and gave me the information I needed to make a decision on what services were needed. No pushing or pressure to get services. Thanks Jiffy Lube! I will definitely be back!",
        "They want you to sign a document charging a large amount of money if you don't cancel within 24 hours, yet they make you wait and wait when you're there for your appointment. I'm always on-time!!\\n I've owned two businesses and don't treat my customers that way. I'm going somewhere else.",
        "I have been to the new location in Surprise twice now. Most of these places are all the same - I was greeted as I came in and offered a sample cup. The bananalicious or whatever it's called is really, really good! My kids love going here for a sweet treat after swimming lessons. The employees are great, the place is clean and the yogurt is yummy.",
        "Slow service, and drink order was messed up. Not a very busy night and had to wait too long to get our appetizers and meals.  Nice visual appearance but very dissapointed in the restaurant atmosphere with what is suppose to be new orleans style hospitality.\\n\\nBut I have to say the food did not dissapoint!",
        "Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \\\"your\\\" coffee shop.\\n\\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask).",
        "Viet Kitchen is not for vegetarians.\\nThe food don't taste good, kitchen is not clean, service is bad, when you enter the restaurant before half an hour of the closing time, the waitress may yell at you and say they are cleaning the kitchen. \\nSeeing the reviews here, I think the restaurant may have some non vegetarian dishes which are good yet the kitchen IS very dirty.\\n\\nI will never go to Viet Kitchen.",
        "This place used to be bomb. You can tell they are cutting corners now. They took off their best appetizer queso fundido, service was slow, no longer 24hours, and they barely comp drinks for players,got hasseled everytime I ordered a.drink and I was playing maMuch better options in town, no point of wasting time or money herex credits and fast. there are much better options in town, no point of wasting money or time here",
        "I stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding, and let me tell you this place has everything for everyone. The kids loved the Tournament of Kings, the wife loved Thunder from Down Under.What more can u ask for, as for me I just wanted to gamble. It's pretty cheap too if your bringing the whole family. Couldn't have asked for a better time. Cool hotel!",
        "This was a great spot to take a break from it all and just people watch.  We sat at the bar facing the casino and we were entertained the whole time.  The mini grilled cheese (appetizer) was fantastic. It came with a tomato based dipping sauce that was the perfect compliment to the bite sized wedges.  Tip - ask for two dipping sauces because one just won't do.",
        "Ricky and his family keep the best Vietnamese in town low key, top quality and with a Midas touch. His Pho is from scratch, meats of top quality, and attention to detail great. If you are lucky he will pause from his passion of cooking and come and greet you with genuine charm. He could not get a higher recommendation on his value for the cost either.",
        "Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem, lack of posting for the appropriate tee off locations.\\nPlease mark by colors at each tee off. Provide better signage for those of us who are new to this course. Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate.",
        "The dinner crepes were good, I had the crepe with scallops (can't remember the name) the scallops could have been fresher. The dessert crepe we had though was amazing! We added strawberries to the salted caramel crepe which we were informed was a family recipe brought over from France. If you don't get dessert here you are missing out my friend.",
        "YUMMMMM! \\nThe atmosphere is so comfortable, I especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. The food is excellent especially the pizza and I think its hard to find good pizza!! This is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)\\nGreat food at an excellent value with wonderful service! What more could you possibly want.",
        "My tip, try the Adult Milkshake. 16oz glass of ice cream with 1.3 to 2oz of vodka. Plus the food portions are large so don't bother ordering appetizers unless you can really pack it in.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "Tonight I got the steak and arugula salad - also known as a big mistake. The lettuce was soggy from being soaked in the vinaigrette. As I was eating it, my fork picked up  wet clumps of the lettuce. Not very appetizing looking at all. The steak itself was somewhat tough and bland. Overall, I will not get it again if I ever come back to this place.",
        "Came here on a whim on a Friday night without a reservation and they were booked solid. Luckily while we were waiting around trying to figure somewhere else to go they had a cancellation and we got the table.\\n\\nEveryone liked their food (pork, risotto, sardines, sweet potato wedges). The service was excellent- very fast and efficient! We also enjoyed the atmosphere and found the place to be really cute.",
        "If you are having a party and need some inexpensive decorations then the 99 Cents store is the place to be. Packs of two streamers. 99 cents. Package of 20 balloons. 99 cents. Plates, utensils, napkins. You guessed it, 99 cents. The kicker, they have plenty of colors to go with almost any color scheme.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "\\\"Honestly guys I know you guys are busy today but please don't be rude to me n tell me to make a reservation next time and turn your back n continue talking to your friend so rude. I walked out and went next door where I was treated like a guest and waited 30 minutes, and enjoyed my meal. Don Vito's is way better.",
        "Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive).",
        "This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!",
        "Food is amazing, but you do pay for it so bring your big credit card.  Wonderful service, beautiful restaurant and you can't get fish any more fresh than Milos!\\n\\nHIGHLY recommend the grilled octopus appetizer, I still dream about it.",
        "M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.",
        "Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience.",
        "I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is",
        "Worst service and food I've had in Madison for a long time.  Ordered one of the house specialties, and asked for medium spicy.  Also ordered spring rolls.  The first plate arrived with my dinner - totally bland, so sent it back.  The new attempt was better, but not anything to write home about.  And dinner arrived just before the spring roll appetizer.  Never got the 2nd beer that was ordered.  First time here - probably the last.",
        "My wife and I ate here for my 50th Birthday.\\nWe enjoyed it very much! Z greeted us and explained the fusion concept, as well as the specials. We shared a delicious avocado shrimp salad followed by Curry fried rice (meatless) and I tried the yellow curry chicken \\\"extra spicy\\\"! My wife who has a very sensitive stomach loved everything! I also enjoyed every dish and would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family!",
        "This is one of the worst labs I have ever been to and I tried it more than once.  One time I sat in the jam packed waiting room for over 45 minutes without a single patient being called.  The staff were unbelievably rude and it is always insanely crowded.  If you can manage the Sonora Quest in Glendale takes appointments and has always been great.",
        "Spent last night at the hotel and the bed in the room is called a murphy bed which is a pullout couch.  Paying hotel rates for a pull out couch was like visiting the parents.\\n\\nwent to complain but they would not let me cancel my reservation and go to another hotel\\n\\nservice was bad and could not wait for the sun to rise \\n\\nRun away from this place",
        "This place is horrible! \\n\\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?",
        "Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless.",
        "greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all",
        "Loved the Happy Hour!  Their bartender Frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  Taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious.  We came back every day of our stay.",
        "So so menu choices but goodness their marinara is great!!!  We bought the risotto friend appetizer and a pizza and both were better because of the marinara. The menu just doesn't hit its stride. It's an ok place to go but not something to go out of your way for."

Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Super expensive, but a beautiful setting..I have only been to camelback inn to \\\"spa\\\" and thought I would try some place new.  Had a great expresso mud wrap and massage with Damian from Poland.  As a mother of 4, I was not cool with hearing kids scream at the pool DURING MY service.  And the maintainence man on his walky-talky outside my room wasn't very nice either.",

The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "I went to Mariana's specifically to pick up tamales for Christmas '09.  What a mistake.  There was too much masa, and not nearly enough meat.\\n\\nAnd, thy must have used too much lard and not enough water to make the masa because it was thick and hard like plaster...evn though they were taken right out of the cooker.\\n\\nWhat a total disappointment,",
        "I really go to this place to have their drinking chocolate. Its a $4.00 of pure bliss. They have 4 flavors. I always get the Mayan witch is a Slightly spicy drinking chocolate.

        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",

The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too.

Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "I wasn't here very long, just long enough to half kill myself walking five miles, loaded down with carry ons, from my arrival gate to the departure gate.  Ugh.  If you're gonna make people walk halfway across the city for a connecting flight, at least provide some sort of shuttle or something.  NOT an airport I care to go through again.",

I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "...I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, I've heard so much about it.  I had the burnt ends BBQ sandwich + twice baked potatoes + Sioux City Ginger Beer (non-alcoholic) which was a great combination.    If you're up for BBQ sauce that's thick, spicy + sweet this is the place for you!",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",

Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",

Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like \\\"hi! Um.....nooooo\\\". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky \\\"manager\\\".",

As a veterinarian, I make recommendations very carefully and I highly recommend this service to my friends, family and clients!",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli.

Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",
        "Seriously one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Ordered the Wellington, chorizo stuffed lobster tail, onion soup, green salad & rib eye. All absolutely amazing! Service was awesome place was cool worth every penny. If you are havin hard time thinking prices are high it's def worth it. Will go back my next Vegas trip!",
        "It's been a very long time since we have eaten at Lupie's.  It was good, but I ordered the chili that is too hot and too thick.  They have others I should have chosen.  My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently.",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "Best burger ever! Homemade bun so soft and somewhat like Hawaiian bread. Truffle fries are amazing!",
        "Love this place, great Thai food. We ordered Panang, Egg Rolls, Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Everything was amazing except the Pad Thai. They use really thin noodles, which I've not seen before. It wasn't my favorite, but everything else was delicious. I would definitely go back!",
        "I had a bul-gogi burrito with a chicken fusion taco. Everything was amazing. The thinly sliced beef was absolutely delicious. Loved the chicken on the fresh corn tortillas. i was also served complimentary chips and salsa and guac, which was awesome and unexpected. I all this... plus a bottle of water for 6.48. Unreal. Go here. You will not be disappointed.",
        "I was told the rooms were renovated but was a basic clean up... Still has popcorn on the ceiling, clean but not anything fancy. Flat screen tv was terrible reception, heat and air is old and is loud and outdated. Very old casino that dates back to 1955 and is a good place to stay if you like vintage. Does not have a good filtration in the casinos and smoke is strong smelling. Would never, never stay here again... Never!",
        "I signed up for a 30 min massage, I was not impressed. \\n\\nThe upstairs has leaks in the ceiling.  Additionally, when you are in the massage area, you can hear everything that is going on downstairs--which is not even mildly relaxing. \\n\\nAs far as massage....I've had better at a fraction of the price.",
        "This is the worst food I have ever had. Smelly Salmon, mushy broccoli, saw dust dry burger, rock hard ribs. Even the mashed potatoes were thick and dry. I understand this place's forte' is rock memorabilia, they should at least provide palatable food, not saw dust. They would be better off serving TV dinners. Stay away from this place. if you must go, then just have some appetizers and leave.",
        "Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\\n\\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty.",
        "Warning: The chocolate brownie cookies must be loaded with crack, because they are extremely addictive. Broccoli cheese soup is phenomenal, and the sandwich (Italian) was good as well. 10/10 would eat again, and again, and again.",
        "This was fun. Got a little board at times.",
        "I don't know how you screw up a grilled vegetable sandwich on focaccia bread, but they managed to do it. Slimey, undercooked with no flavour. Pizza was too bready. I wouldn't bother with this place. I don't even know how they call this Italian food, just bec. they put tomato sauce on it?",
        "This only gets a one star because at least it has a/c.  This is grosser than a motel 8 on the side of an abandoned town. The place is filthy, grimey and definitely not worth any amount of money paid. There were torn condom wrappers, whole acrylic nails, cig butts, beer cans and random bodily fluids throughout the elevators and well....everywhere else in the hotel/casino.",
        "There is a time when the price you are charged gives an expectation for quality service and quality food. But stacks and yolks isn't a place of good value or good taste. The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug",
        "My favorite place in town.  I started going there because I live close by.  The food is excellent - slightly creative pub style.  Excellent beer selection - rotating taps mean you'll always find something new.  Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately, which can lead to inconsistent service.  Usually good, though.",
        "A little expensive but I was in a bit of a hurry so settled for something convenient over price. Service was ok, albeit somewhat awkward. \\n\\nThere are cheaper ones I he area but the one I checked before was closed when I needed them, so this place was not only convenient but available. Good enough in a pinch.",
        "Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying.",
        "We've some stuff on the menu - burgers, a wrap, onion rings, fries, etc- and it was all fairly mediorce, but reasonably priced at around 7-8 bucks for dinner.  \\n\\nBut hey - the hot wings here are amazing.  No complaints.  They're perfect.  ORDER THE WINGS!!!",
        "Awesome place. Sometimes hard to get seats so patience is a must or just flat out luck but totally worth it! Parking is easy and free.  Totally recommended and cant wait for a bigger location to open up! Prices are fair and sizes are perfect.",
        "I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.",
        "Tasty.  Nice, sit down Mexican food place with very friendly service.  Lots of options available including veggie.  Somewhat outdated interior, but still pleasant.  Kudos to the server that got us a fresh chips and salsa refill BEFORE we asked for it.\\n\\nSignificantly better than your average Mexican joint.  Closed on Sundays.",
        "Mirrored ceilings? Check.\\nFluorescent rainbow lights? Check.\\nVegas eye candy? Check.\\nHot tub & fireplace combo? Check. \\nPeppermills on the table? Check. \\n\\nyeah, this place is sweeeeet.  And they make a BLT with avocado...BLAT!",
        "Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.\\n\\nSmall portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.\\n\\nThey ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer.",
        "Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out.",
        "I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! \\n\\nI usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. \\nAmazing! \\n\\nAlso try the tofu fries, they are delicious. \\n\\nTop it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",
        "This is made of cinderblock and cement. If that is your aesthetic taste, go for it.  My room flooded twice, my patio flooded, the hallway ceiling was caving in, and it took 3 days to fix it.  And to be frank, no one at the hotel seemed to care. There are too many other nice hotels and resorts in the Scottsdale area to stay at this one.",
        "Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options",
        "Definitely needs a major renovation update....! Popcorn ceilings, damp smell upon arrival in room, bedsheet covers are what you will see at great great grandma's house, you get the vibe this place does not feel clean at all, towels are thin & off-white color, parking cost $15 with in & out privileges. The only good things are FREE wi-fi and Lucie at front desk was friendly & informative.",
        "Everything was expertly prepared and the service was wonderful! The quality of the ingredients was amazing, and the place was very comfortable, slightly rustic but still beautiful and trendy. The braised beef, truffle pizza, and cheesecake were my favorites! Food came out in a reasonable time, and even though my friends and I stayed a while after we finished eating, we never felt rushed. I will definitely be back!",
        "Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca",
        "middling italian fare on the grassmarket. you could do much worse in the UK  (think bella italia) but you could also do better. it's a fine place to enjoy a slightly better than average italian meal on a sunny day.",
        "Decent place, good food, great  atmosphere to watch a game. Thank god the karaoke was not there tonight. Service could be better, mainly faster. The servers are spread too thin, as there seem to never be enough top handle the crowd. Otherwise a decent pace too have a drink, grab a bite and watch sports.",
        "Went from an A to a B and now to a C. Wasn't displaying the grade for awhile. Now they have their C up. I'm one of over 16 calls to the health board I'm told.",
        "First time eating at Wildflower. Went out to breakfast earlier this week with a friend. Great experience! Delicious meal! Got the lemon ricotta pancakes and 2 sunny side up eggs. Yummy! Love the berry topping. Cashier was super helpful in helping decide on that since I wanted everything on the menu :)",
        "I have been going to rebeckha lafferty for years..best at cutting very thick hair and colors knowledge is great. .only go to her. .If she is off wait till she is available. ..",
        "Disappointed. I got the lunch special which is a good amount of food for the price. But the food wasnt worth it. It wasn't hot, barely even warm, the enchilada sauce was too thick, and I think they could try a little harder. I'm back to going to Rositas.",
        "Tonight I got the steak and arugula salad - also known as a big mistake. The lettuce was soggy from being soaked in the vinaigrette. As I was eating it, my fork picked up  wet clumps of the lettuce. Not very appetizing looking at all. The steak itself was somewhat tough and bland. Overall, I will not get it again if I ever come back to this place.",
        "I don't shop at Bebe because I feel their clothes don't fit the average size woman. They are definitely made high fashion for size zero. \\nMost of their designs are made for the club scene with skimpy outfits and cocktail dresses. Some of their clothes are cute, but way overpriced. It also seems they want to stamp their name on EVERYTHING possible. Tacky!",
        "Service was uninsprired.  So many options at so many interesting and exciting places in Vegas . . . does not seem possible.\\n\\nWe were with a group of guys with big plans for the evening.  We had to stand-up, find servers to get them to come to the table to bring us more drinks.\\n\\nFood was very good.\\n\\nLike the viewing grill.\\n\\nRoom is tired.",
        "Nice selection, local hangout spot, poorly located. At least currently it requires a walk slightly out of the comfort zone for some. Worth it if you aren't too cautious though.",
        "Only mediocre compared to Texas de Brazil. It fell very short on the atmosphere and the salad bar. Slightly short on the meats. Couldn't believe we were seated with no reservation so easily....now I know. Service was overzealous!! (I guess that's better than inattentive).",
        "I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!",
        "Waaaaaaay too much smoke in the Casino, yuck!\\nAnd very, very low ceilings - very claustrophobic :(",
        "Nice place to hang out and grab some food and drink.  I like to sit at the bar.  My favorite is the hot chick chicken sandwich.  I love their skinny crispy fries.",
        "The food is what you would expect from a little burrito shop with a drive through.  Filling, somewhat greasy and cheap!  One warning and what made me stop going here was when my boyfriend handed them his debit card to pay and they handed him a slip of paper and said, write your pin number down please.\\n\\nno thanks, I took my business to Fiesta Burrito.",
        "Sunsational is one of my hide outs when I need to get away from the house. The food is tasty and the coffee is excellent. I have often used the drive thru and the few times I have come by with my dog they have a biscuit for my little guy.",
        "This has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers I have had in a very long time.\\n\\nSushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful.  Burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor",
        "Chimichangas are very good and filling....couldn't finish it. The salsa was decent and slightly spicy.  Had a peach Margarita...very yummy and strong.",
        "Compared to Sora Ramen, I like this much better.  We had the thin noodles and they were al dente. The broth was also thicker and tastier. Try the takana fried rice (with mustard greens). It was also very tasty!",
        "Just had lunch here and thought the food was ok. Some items have two portion sizes on them which gives the server a great opportunity to up sell the guest. The problem is they don't ask. The server just automatically gave us the large portion of everything, which is not what we wanted. Now that I know their tricks I will pay more attention IF I actually go back.",
        "I like this place for lunch. It is relativley inexpensive, and healthy as you can get a wrap and side (choice of soup, pasta salad, or fruit) for about $7. Everything there seems fresh, they have quick service and a unique dinning and patio area. My favorite wrap is the buffalo chicken and I would reccomend it to everyone.",
        "My breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland. We got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes. The pancakes didn't even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre. Although the presentation was nice, I won't be coming back.",
        "Friendly staff\\nCrunchy munchy wrap was yummy\\nSweet potato wedges with sriracha mayo was pretty good.\\n\\nWill be back.",
        "So I've ordered pizza a couple of times from Fuel. Both times have asked for extra cheese. Must say pretty lame, very thin layer. Not worth it, will look for pizza delivery from someone else.",
        "$18 for a bowl of soup with a 1/2 pound of spagetti noodles, two thin slices of beef, a pinch of basil, a pinch of bean sprouts and a pinch of cilantro with a couple hot peppers.  Maybe it was because it was the end of my four days in Vegas and it gets tiring to be hammered with overpriced food day after day after day, but this was the final straw.",
        "The Keg is a franchise and is my FAVORITE restaurant! This location in particular is slightly sub par in my book. On multiple occasions I've had to send food back because it just didn't taste right. On a good note I hosted my birthday dinner here and had a fairly large party. Our two servers were very accommodating and were able to keep up with our cocktail orders. Very fun place.",
        "Great subs! I've been going here for years... they cut the meat right in front of you, give you generouis amounts, bread is fresh, and staff is always pretty friendly. It is MUCH better than any subway or quizno's I've been to. Get your subs fully loaded, it is DELICIOUS."

        "Loved it! I was visiting from NYC with a few friends, and we decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table.  I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.",
        "This was a huge let down!! It's in terrible need of a MAJOR cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were!! We will not be going here again",
        "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.",
        "Why always such a long wait... ??? And if waiting is forever long, why install those most uncomfortable park bench... Staffs are awful & unhelpful & slow... Really ?",
        "Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.",
        "Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!",
        "Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "A lot of people love the Mirage... I'm not a big fan. \\n\\nI like it there. It's okay. It's in a decent location, it has some good restaurants, some bars and other things, it just doesn't tickle my fancy much. Maybe it's the middle-aged vibe? It feels older. The crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out.",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",

Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in...",

        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "The boba drink was terrible, but the shaved ice was good.",

Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",

        "This place is hit or miss. I love the food, the menu has a great selection, however I have had some bad experiences here. I took my mom here one afternoon and the service was horrible, we sat at our table and waited forever before we even got water and when we finally got our food it was cold. I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again",
        "This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time",
        "This place is sensational. Went her about 7-8 times in our 10 day stay in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills. Just couldn't get enough. Food and variety of is great, terrific decor and friendly service. A restaurant that really has it all together. Red Sangria best I've ever had.",
        "I don't get what all the craze is about. My burrito was just okay---I had better burritos in Boston which doesn't really say much about haberneros. It's better than all the chain burrito places but it doesn't leave me saying \\\"wow. That was good.\\\"",
        "One of those places you just go when you are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian because it's so convenient, has that menu item that every person in your party wants whether it be fake pho noodle soup or a burger, and you can crawl into the restaurant at 1:00am to satisfy your drunk hunger.... \\n\\nThe bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal.\\nThe service is really slow....",
        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.",

This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",

My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "Horrible for the overpriced food",
        "They're menu is constantly changing, and they're adding more items -- which is great! When they first opened there wasn't many choices.  Great place for Japanese curry, but I wish they had unlimited Japanese pickled items. Their Katsu curry is awesome!!!",

        "TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",

I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!",

I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.",
        "This is my first sushi experience in Arizona and it was good, but nothing spectacular. The food is good, the service is decent and they would've gotten four stars, except the music that plays is SO annoying that it ruins the atmosphere of the place. Ambience is pleasing to the eye, but horrible on the ears.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",

The sole redemption of Miracle Mile shops might be Sephora for last-minute needs. Don't  care for the crowd here - can be sketch.",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown.

Pork tenderloins my fave! Level is usually 5, and its not bad at all. \\n\\nThey even got specials and side items around the restaurant. Look out what they are and try em too!",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",

Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \\nIt wasn't horrible.",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "Not bad for a local fish fry.  I had Steve's platter and the portion was plenty for each item.  The wife had a two item combo and had more oysters than anyone could assume in one setting.  The kids enjoyed the kid menu items.  We had about a 25 min wait that was not expect, but went fairly quickly as they moved consumers in and out quickly.",
        "Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \\\"grunge\\\" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.",
        "Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",

But it is the Forum shops and makes for a great time none the less to get out of the Hot Vegas Sun and look at things you may never afford or would want if you could afford it. Lots of good restaurants inside as well. Which range from reasonable to Take out a Second Mortgage on the house.",
        "I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts.

Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office.",

Tony did a fantastic job helping me to order flowers for my girlfriend and at such last minute as well.

I am truly impressed with their great service and help.",

Felt like we wouldn't be worthy of a table, even though I have money to spend here for a bachelorette extravaganza. Too bad. I'll never be back. Managment is horrible and would prefer to see an empty restaurant that a table of girls.",

        "One word. BOMB. 1st timer at a Greek mediterranean restaurant all though I had Gyros b4. Found out I been pronouncing it wrong this hole time but let's get to the point. Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way.",
        "Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10.

        "One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!",

My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",

There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better.",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",

        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",

The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug",

Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here.",
        "This is my favorite pizza joint by my house. Their zepolle donuts are to die for. It's only 3.99 for 24!  I buy it for potlucks and it always becomes a fav from my friends. C-Los and Mike (friends) sniff up the powder from it like cocaine. That's how good it is. And oh their pizza is great too. Try the NY cheese pizza.",
        "I guess this is not a bad place for this side of town, however, it's definitely not the best place in town.  The fish is not as fresh and the rolls were literally falling apart. I guess they make it up by offering cheap prices for all you can eat... 18.95 for lunch and 21.95 for dinner. The staff was friendly and the service was fast! I would recommend the la boxing and maria roll there were both delicious!",
        "Looks and feel like 99c store, or $1 store with prices higher than at Macy's. You have to crawl between shelves. Do not go, do not waste your time.",

        "I come here about two times a week, but I have noticed that their prices are steadily going up and up. Not only that, the portion size has been shrinking. One of my favorite plates used to be $4.95, then it went up to $5.95 and now it's $6.95! This is all within a year! Taste wise, their pho is great and so is their fried rice plates. Customer service is pretty poor.",
        "Super friendly staff, innovative locking mechanism that takes a noticeable effort to break this deterring break-ins and clean very very CLEAN.\\n\\nOnly a small annoyance but the keypads for the gate is inconveniently too far to the left causing you to either drive REALLY close to it or get out of your vehicle. Small trade for everything else.",

        "Stop trying to roll my burrito into the size of a baseball, it doesn't make it any bigger.  For $1.95 dallop of guacamole, make sure the avocados are at least ripe.  Guac from unripe avocados is not OK no matter how much you puree it.",
        "Very disappointing ! I had a lot of expectation from this place , heard so much about the chef and basically it's really not that good \\nBeside the food everything was ok so really the star is just for the food \\nThe fish dish was awful ! I even think it wasn't fresh because of the after taste \\nSeriously the $1000 bill wasn't well spent",
        "I had the lunch special. My service was excellent and both the half tuna melt, which my server recommended, and the green salad were delicious, far exceeding my expectations for a bar and grill. The house-made blue cheese dressing was also great. Plus it was cheap at $6.95. They also had free Wi-Fi and some craft beers on tap.",
        "You ever been smacked in the bag by accident while playing sports? How about a 100 times a night? They need to work on some crowd control strats in that place. Music was OK.

After I finally got my appointment, they  charged me an extra $20 AND did a horrible job! Will NEVER go here again or refer them! Wish I could leave 0 stars!",
        "Not impressed! The meats were very salty! No refills on soft drinks! The filet was really dry! We were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasn't comped?

        "I am not a big fan of pizzas but I wanted to give this place a try. With an excellent concept of customizing your pizza with a number of ways(way more than traditional) and have it on a fresh, thin bread, this place is a must try for everyone. The 11 inch pizza was perfect for lunch and worth every penny of the 7.95 I spent on it.",

        "Hands down the best prime rib available, if the old saying is true you get what you pay for than this is quality at its finest, pricing is fair, about a hundred dollars for two with drinks, and they even bring the carving station to your table while the chef cuts the meat to your liking, all out great service.",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "I've been a customer since 1998.  Trying to cancel hardline telephone service in Vegas on a Monday evening.  I was on hold for 25  minutes.  Then the rep tells me they can't cancel my phone service unless I start paying for the modem or buy a new one.  Not renting a modem. Between both homes, I'm shelling out nearly 300 per month.  Guess I'll go ahead and cancel ALL my service.in Vegas and Phoenix.",

Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\\n\\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive.",

        "I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.",
        "I love their burrito's and could eat them daily if I didn't have to worry about weighing 400 lbs. The problem with this place is the parking stinks and if you go at a busy time (lunch) it is packed and isn't quick to get in and out. This keeps me from going as often as I would like.",
        "The last time I was there, They had the nerve to want to charge me for a to-go water for $.99 cent. F**** this place. I just got done dishing out $8.50 for lunch, then that was the icing on the cake.",
        "We ordered the 44 Magnum with the extra shot and 1/2 yard. Between my honey and I we were definitely feeling the effects of the alcohol by the time we made it back out to the street. Well worth the $12. Unfortunately I've got a horrid headache now at 7pm from all the cheap liquor from today.",
        "This place reminded me of Whiskey River without the shit kickers on the beach side and more of the laid back people. There were dance offs on the floor it seemed people were having fun. 99 cent Jaeger bombers and I heard 99 cent tacos or something. There was a wet t contest with only 3 contestants it was kinda sad but entertaining nonetheless. I'd probably go again.",

The eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns were exactly how I ordered them.\\n\\nWe will be back!",
        "The food was ok nothing special... But the service was horrible!! The waitress forgot to give us menus first if all then I didn't get a drink refill not once!! Then the bill was 100 bucks for 7 people.  So not worth the money!!! I'm not a cheap person but I refuse to pay for bad service",

Don't get anything red velvet-flavored. The best breakfast item was egg florentine that gushes with butter.",

Luckily while we were waiting around trying to figure somewhere else to go they had a cancellation and we got the table.\\n\\nEveryone liked their food (pork, risotto, sardines, sweet potato wedges). The service was excellent- very fast and efficient! We also enjoyed the atmosphere and found the place to be really cute.",

They are definitely made high fashion for size zero. \\nMost of their designs are made for the club scene with skimpy outfits and cocktail dresses. Some of their clothes are cute, but way overpriced. It also seems they want to stamp their name on EVERYTHING possible. Tacky!",

        "Came in for some appetizers, stayed for about an hour. The bartender was very polite, knowledgable and most important -honest and had a sense of humor. Food was a 4/5, service was 4.5 / 5. We'd come back here during our next trip out.",

Finally great food with a great price .",

The coupons range from 30% to 50% off usually. This visit I was handed a 50% off coupon on handbags. If you like Coach, you'll love this outlet store.",

The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",

The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "Went to there truck at Ces had a huge line so I was excited, took 35 minuets to come out and they got my order wrong!

Wasn't to original but meat was done right. I would go back if there wasn't a wait.",

The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",

This is by far the closest dispensary to me, but a half is 30-40 bucks more than some of my favorite spots. I can drive to the west valley and back and have spent less on gas and bud than I would on just bud at this place.",

Loved the chicken on the fresh corn tortillas. i was also served complimentary chips and salsa and guac, which was awesome and unexpected. I all this... plus a bottle of water for 6.48. Unreal. Go here. You will not be disappointed.",
        "After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.",

        "The burger was the best I've ever had, had the Poblano. Everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch. Unfortunately I waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period, the service was abysmal. But, I will be back for the burgers. If not for the service, would have been five stars.",

OK!\\n\\nThe gaming minimums are pretty decent - $5 dice, a ton of slots, lots of card games. \\n\\nOf course, it is not the lap of luxury. But not a bad place to serve as a launch pad for a Las Vegas extravaganza.",
        "Don't go here for breakfast. Both mine and my husband's food was very greasy, cool, and not very tasty. I usually find it difficult to screw up breakfast, but this place found a way. The service was also slow. The $40 spent on some coffee and a few eggs was the worst $40 I spent in Vegas. I will not be back!!",

No detail of our bills and no paper receipts. Bad!!!",

We ended up with 40+ people who had a blast playing games, listening to the band, drinking, eating and just hanging out.  Kids are allowed in until around 10 so it was nice to have them be able to attend.  THE perfect night!!",

I am a regular at their Charleston location and I love it. I am in and out of there in less than 5 minutes. But today, I have been waiting for my BC Pills for over an hour. Flamingo location is NOT RECOMMENDED! And the staff is rude too.",
        "No, it's not MGM or Mandalay Bay. It is a good buffet for the money. The lunch buffet had a lot of good options. They have Middle Eastern, Asian, Mexican, Italian and American standards. For $35 you can get three buffets in a day. I wouldn't suggest it, but you could!",

        "Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",

No one in lobby to great you and the customer waiting area has garbage in it from Thursday when I dropped in to try and get the oil changed then",
        "Love the food, but am VERY disappointed that I was charged 1.50 for a refill, when every other time I have been to Which Wich, it was only .50  I don't understand how they can get away with charging different prices.  It seems to me that the price should be the same nationwide...and I have been to several different locations nationwide...all only charged .50 !  This will definitely affect my decision about how often to come here.",

And it is right up the street !",
        "Went for lunch today for the first time. HMMMM expected a little more than we got. The service was great, but the food-so-so. Both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry. I asked for extra mayo but it never came. And COKE in a can for $2.50....come on, with those prices get a fountain. I probably won't be back.",
        "Service was was good but slow.\\nFood was good but the entree (Filet Mignon) I was told could only be prepared Medium after asking for Med Well. \\nSalad arrived after 40 min. \\nMy entree arrived about 40 min later and my steak was medium rare at best and barely warm. No sign of a waiter to send back for 15 min. \\nIt's not hard to cook a steak but they cant get it done.",
        "Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them.",
        "The food is pretty good. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken, which is $10.50. Its just too expensive for fast food.",
        "Way over priced! $23 for two salads and two sodas! Really!  I will drive to Stephanie next time!",
        "The staff is nice, but the clothing is super overpriced. $40 for a plain t-shirt? No thanks.",
        "The worst Korean BBQ I have ever been, not too much choice u can really eat, also they serve some Chinese& Japanese food, wt the hell!!!!!! It's not a real Korean BBQ. Also let's talk abt the price I walked in by myself, order a ice tea to drink, total for me is $28!!!!",
        "I just tried their Tomato soup & it was really good! But what I really liked was the FREE Stuff....Get a FREE Bagel w/ CC, Join EBB VIP Text Club!

        "Wait staff and service was good.  My steak was excellent (Tabasco peppered Kobe flank). My friends duck was mediocre and the fat was not rendered. We didn't have time to wait for a fix so she just ate it.  The sides with it were good. The worst part of the experience was the fact that they charged $5 for hot water. 35 for mediocre duck and 40 for a steak.  I find charging for hot water ridiculous.",
        "Purchased a six inch with combo at this subway and I was charged $8.50. The soda and the drink was half the price of my sandwich? When I went to a different subway for the same meal I was charged $6.30. Won't be going back to this subway.",
        "This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.",
        "The slowest drive thru I have ever experienced. I got in line at 11:20, it's now 11:50 and I haven't even made it to the speaker to take my order. Only 6 cars ahead of me! Ridiculous. People seem friendly but are either short staffed or not very good at their jobs.",
        "Best Buffet I've been to in Vegas so far, but that's not really saying much seeing that I've only been to a couple.  They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF / Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent.",
        "Nice ambiance (went for a friend's birthday dinner before going out, restaurant was playing top 40 hits) Food is a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality, although the spicy tuna rolls were pretty good! If you are looking to go to dancing later, you get free admission to Tao the lounge upstairs so that's a nice bonus.",
        "Went to an afternoon show with my Dad (he's 76, I'm 52), and we both loved it. Only issue is that there are no servers, just a self-serve bar. Kid-friendly, too.",
        "Been there many times and have not been disappointed by the BBQ. Only been open for a short time but has won many awards and \\\"best of\\\" contests. Travel Channel has already spotlighted them! Be prepared to wait in line. The quickest I have made it through getting my food is about 40 minutes. Despite the wait, it is still a 5 star join.",
        "What a horrible experience-had an emergency and needed to cancel my reservation more than 48 hours in advance...got the total runaround, talked to a bunch of people I couldn't understand only to be told no cancellations except 72 hours in advance.  Beware, do not book because you might have an emergency and hilton grand Elara is too big to care.",
        "Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw.",
        "Disappointed. Came in for a late breakfast as many tables were getting up. The dining area was at maybe a third capacity and our two omelets still took 40 minutes. Our server was pleasant enough, the place was clean and our food was pretty decent but I definitely became  \\\"hangry\\\" during that 40 minutes. As far as the price, quality and wait: I would go to Lazy Jane's over Willalby's in the future.",
        "I've never had a better massage and I've had too many to count over my 57 years.\\nAmma is fabulous. It was not like anything I've ever experienced.  Almost like a Yoga massage, if there is such a thing. Amma seems to instinctively know where to push and pull and move you to make your whole body relax.  Can't wait to go back to her!",
        "The staff was nice but there services where very disappointing! I paid $50 for the full service deluxe deal and had to tell them 3 times about issues about my car having dirt on it, windshield being dirty, and not vacuuming the floor/carpet well.  I will never return or recommend this place. Avoid it. And ya $50 down the drain! :-(",
        "VERY DISAPPOINTING. Waited for 15-20 minutes for a table despite empty tables everywhere. Order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and BOTH orders were WRONG. Sad.",
        "Just moved back to Phoenix and decided to check this place out. Peter cut my hair and did an excellent job. I also got a neck shave followed by a surprise neck and head massage. Total came out to $21 bucks, which I thought was a great deal. I'll be back to see Peter again.",
        "Dinner buffet. The food look old. Crab legs and carving station look like some 9.99 buffets. Dinner is 50.99. But I would not eat here if the price was 20 bucks. I was smart enough to ask them to let me check out the food first. 5 stars for me.",
        "NOT WORTH THE $$$ Had this pizza for the first time the other day at a work function. Decided I'd get one delivered. 3.9 miles away $5 out of area fee. WTF! ONE 16\\\" 2 topping with a side of ranch came out to $27. That's ridiculous. Could have gotten an XL 3 topping plus 12 wings at Barro's for the same price. Will not be odering from here again.",
        "First time eating here, we ordered the garlic bread balls ($7.99- it was good),spinach artichoke dip ($14.99- NO!!! it taste like the one you buy at the grocery frozen section)and rib eye steak ($26.99- Like it!! was juicy and tender).",
        "Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \\\"Johnny\\\" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50.",
        "Also went here and there phos free is 60 and everywhere else is 29.99. Wayyyy overpriced",
        "Good dry cleaning at a great price. \\nThis place is simple and good. The staff is efficient and gets down to business. They have successfully saved a few of my blouses from my clumsy stains.\\nOne tip is to be sure to pay with cash. They accept debit cards too but charge a $.50 processing fee.",
        "Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here."

Thanks Desert Dog Pet Care you ROCK!!!!!!!",
        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "Industrial chic, great people, almost like having dinner at a friends house, only better. Great food! Amazing really. They use local and fresh ingredients. The menu is always changing.  The wine list is nice, and the craft cocktails have won me over... Especially that good \\\"Bourbon Lemonade.\\\" oh and the brunch is so good! The croque madam with a mango bloody Mary changed my life.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.",
        "The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",
        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",
        "Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \\n\\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure).",
        "If you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service Graze is the place for you.",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "The downtown location food is hit or miss. I don't know if it depends on who is cooking or what is happening. When you go on a 'good\\\" night the food is excelent otherwise it's just ok. This location does consistenly have poor service though especially on the patio.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!",
        "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "What a menu! So many things to choose from. The open face turkey sandwich was delicious. It was just like eating a homemade Thanksgiving dinner. Clam chowder was also great.\\nMy son has the cheesy cheese burger and fresh cut fries which he said was yummy.\\nWe'll be back.",
        "Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.",

        "Great place fun a fun, social dinner.",
        "Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better.",
        "My boyfriend and I love this place! Great mojitos and be ready to eat! Great lighting. Lots of room.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "decent... i had the \\\"sin city\\\" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers....",
        "Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Over priced!  But then again it is the Las Vegas strip!! Cool atmosphere, typical food.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \\n\\nKey is to call ahead.\\n\\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.",
        "The place was awesome. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. And definitely reasonably priced. Check it out. I know that I will be going back.",
        "The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "No longer serving food :/ and not a huge selection of smoothies...\\n\\nStill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a VegasHot! class.",
        "Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk",
        "We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",
        "We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, \\\"wow, thats tasty\\\" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "While visiting with family in Las Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Mimi's since my uncle recommended it. We were not disappointed, the food and service were great! The pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome!",
        "The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",
        "The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.",
        "I've visited Fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that I've moved back to Phx.  Tasty and inventive food, good service, really nice atmosphere.",
        "Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Never again! \\n\\n1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged. \\n\\n2. expensive for the low quality \\n\\n3. service is bad \\n\\n4. miserable decor \\n\\nDon't waste your money! \\n\\nWorst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed! \\n\\nI suggest \\\"Super Mex\\\" see my review! Durango/215.",
        "Service was excellent, but food was just okay.",
        "Food presentation was great and the chips and salsa was really yummy. Actual meal was okay. I had the El Pastor tacos and husband had enchiladas. Not bad not great. Our waiter was just okay too. Won't go back",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "Bennys is like a old girlfriend, we've been through the best and the worst together. To start the best is food how the menu is so far and beyond anything around. But I have had hit or miss occasions and I've heard horror stories and glory stories so until consistency pervales  good luck",
        "No problems with food quality, I hear they are under new management. However, they have no condiment bar. I've never heard of a Quizno's that doesn't! I need my horseradish sauce, guys.",
        "This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it.",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",
        "Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!",
        "It was just OK....nothing to write home about. What turned me off the most was that I stood in line for an omlette for 20 minutes on a Monday morning. Not really sure why they had one person on the omlette station, should invest in expanding. Some of the food was a little strange, boiled prunes. At $15.99 I'd go back only for the value, but McDonalds would suffice.",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.",
        "Great service.  Large portions.  A bit tricky to find the place in the dark but it's worth it.",

        "We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",
        "Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.",
        "eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",
        "This place sucks..\\nTook way to long to  get our food",
        "Good food, but not top of the line. Love the portion size for the price! Not crowded especially at lunch, and really reliable takeout. The queso blanco gets hard quick. Especially love the saucy fajitas.",
        "Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic."

My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",

That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",

        "Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.",

Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",

If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D",

        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "Great hot dogs! I had the Chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog, both were great! The fries were also good. The employees were friendly and the service was fast. The place was clean and in good order as well. Give it a try!",
        "Tried with a Groupon. Suprised to be allowed to use multiple Groupons in one visit.  However, not allowed to purchase any specials with the Groupons (e.g half price chicken fingers).  Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!",
        "Tradional american food, the service was good Our waiter was very friendly, the food came out pretty quick.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, I had the strawberry basil mojito very good.  Sometimes they have live music there , theres a nice outside area to eat where you can enjoy the fountain.  Theres a gift shop in the front of the restaurant where you can shop all the hard rock mercandise.",
        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",

The kids love their milkshakes and I have to admit they are really good. Burgers always are cooked right and flavorful.  All of the ingredients are fresh...this is one of our go to places.  It also has a full bar and drinks that have some bang!",
        "I truly enjoyed my experience at Tandoor. The staff was super friendly, the flavors were both fresh and savory. You must order the Samosa's and  garlic naan to start. My curry chicken was also very satisfying. \\nI betcha didn't know they have free WiFi! ;) So get cozy and stay awhile! Don't forget, it's BYOB.",
        "Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!",
        "I eat vegetarian about 95% of the time, but when I feel like eating some flesh I have the turkey sandwich from Blackstrap. Super delicious and soooo flavorful. The braised greens and fried macaroni and cheese balls are really good, too! I know it's a BBQ place, and their whole concept is meat, BUT I would really, really, really love if they threw in a couple main vegetarian options.",
        "It's certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places, but it really ought to go all the way to the airport.  Also, considering the short distance of travel, $5 is quite a lot.",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!",
        "I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.",
        "ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",
        "Great food.  Buffet seems bigger than the one at Maharajah.\\n\\nProblem...... A cockroach ran up the wall behind my wife.   Waiter killed it.  No manager stopped by.  Needless to say we paid for our meal.  We never went back.  A shame too.   We really liked the food!",
        "Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.",
        "No matter how many times they call (nearly every day for the last few months!) and no matter how many times I tell them I am not interested and to please STOP CALLING - they continue to harass - calls come in from 8am until 9pm.  Based on these business practices alone I will never use them.",
        "Went to dinner with my girlfriend the other night and had a fabulous dinner here. The ambiance is lovely and the Mediterranean cuise was varied and delicious. I was also pleased to see when the bill didn't break the bank. I highly recommend this cute little restaurant for a pleasureable dining experience at a great price.",
        "Not a fan of the layout. The dance floor is extremely small. To get to the restrooms, you have to get through the dance floor, which is pretty much impossible when it's jam packed with bodies. Our promoter got the girls in for free and guys at $12 cover. Also not a bad deal that from 11-midnight, it was open bar for ladies.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",

For the entrees i had the  Pollo Rosa Maria Stuffed with fontina and prosciutto, topped with mushrooms and a basil lemon butter sauce. Really great dish. My friend karlee had the manicotti.

        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",

As a veterinarian, I make recommendations very carefully and I highly recommend this service to my friends, family and clients!",

Kal-bi was good, just needed to be seasoned more.  Bim bim bop was very good; fresh ingredients.  Banchan was fresh and tasty also.  Great Korean place in Vegas!",
        "The reason for 2 stars.  Order accuracy!  My food has been wrong the last 3 times!  I ordered 3 quesa tacos for my lady and me.  We ordered 2 shrimp and 1 carnitas.  We got  2 beef and 1 carnitas.  The server said the ticket was correct.  This is the third time this happened!  Don't get me wrong, the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time.",

The menu has been revamped with quality made from scratch food, the staff seems to know what they're doing as I haven't had a long wait for anything. I can say that Sleepy Dog has changed my opinion about their brewbub, changing my review to 4 stars. I highly recommend a pint of Red Rover!",
        "Overpriced for quantity & quality of food.  Sandwich comes with nothing -- if you want fries, extra charge.  I ordered ravioli & requested alfredo sauce rather than marinara sauce (additional charge?!).  It also came with nothing except a piece of burnt garlic bread that I could not even eat.  Most places serve a side salad with a pasta entr\\u00e9e.  Service was slow.  Overall not the worst, but not worth going back to.",
        "Tasty food, juicy dumplings. Service is less than average. \\n\\nTake out frozen dumplings also cook well. (just don't thaw before cooking.)",
        "Excellent coffee drinks. They also roast a variety of their own beans so when you buy those by the pound it makes for great coffee at home.  We are hooked!",
        "Delicious chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies! Sometimes I indulge in their crab rangoons, too...tasty little morsels!",
        "You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!",
        "Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.",
        "My wife and I heard about this restaurant/bar through a friend and we were not disappointed. The food is great, the people are friendly and the prices you can't beat. We've been there three times since hearing about it and we will continue to stop by.",
        "This place was amazing! Impeccable timing out to order to table time with hot fresh is housed. The sauces are awesome. The ambiance is clean cannot say enough good things amazing specials lunch is only $5.99 with the drinks which is also just awesome!",
        "I think this is one of the best brunch buffets in town.  They have the make your own omelet station and great eggs and a fantastic dessert selection.  Also, the champagne for the mimosas was good too.  This place was so good, my petite little roommate ate here for 3 hours.  (Suffice it to say, she was in a food coma for a good part of the day.)  That's some good eating...",
        "One star is very generous for this place. I paid for a executive room with fridge and microwave but that did not happen. The front desk was rude, the room smelt awful, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Also the free breakfast was a joke, it was super cold and gross! Never stay here!!!",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "I love Sardella's!! they have great pizza and the winds are great!! they also have a killer monday special (half price pizza!)  this wings are so good they will make you wanna smack your momma!!",
        "Sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I love the teppanyaki grill.  We go for Happy Hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is AMAZING! I have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have. I love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp. They also have the best drinks. I will be going back consistently!",
        "If you go here, you will enjoy a four course fondue meal. The desert chocolate is awesome. I prefer the 'Smores' option but the others look great also. They have many options for the main course. This place is pricey and you do have to cook your own food, but a nice option for special occasions."

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",

        "The \\\"new\\\" Penguin Drive In leaves a lot to be desired. The server got our order wrong twice (on a slow Thursday night) and the food was cold and bland. No more crispy tater tots, greasy buns, or hot, juicy, and delicious burgers. A sad, sad, sad experience.",
        "My wife and I had these hot dogs last night. Absolutely delicious!!!!! All toppings r free, n nicely presented for a 3.00 hot dog. Definitely a must for late night munchies",

We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub.",
        "Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side.",
        "Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-",

I had the special, the Mac Daddy- hot dog (I chose the spicy dog) with chili, and MAC AND CHEESE on warm nan bread. DAMN!  I will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open. So many wieners so little time....  there's a t-shirt in there somewhere :)",
        "ick. i wanted regular bbq wings with regular bbq sauce and they put hot sauce in the bbq. the vinegar  on hot wings gives me a headache so i can only eat bbq. she kept trying to tell me that i wanted them medium heat.. i dunno.. not going there again i dont think.. at least not to eat",
        "Good bar for the location and size. This would be a good place to get started for the night. I ended up standing by the bar and getting carded when I asked for water. Blech. Drinks were yummy and there was a little room to dance. \\n\\nThe stage above the bar was AWESOME. It was especially nice that there was a hot chick on mic. Fun stuff when you've been drinking.",
        "Cool atmosphere, nice hot chocolate and in one word : Chocolate heaven",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "Happy Hour is the only time I come here, but for good reason!\\nYou can get 3 rolls for $15! Without a doubt my FAVORITE place to get sushi.\\n\\nRated a 4 instead of 5 because of the obnoxiously loud music - ask for the patio if you can brave the heat!",
        "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.",
        "I'm guessing Paul McCartney was singing about Lookout Mountain when he serenaded us with, \\\"the long and winding road, that leads me to your summit\\\".  Well, it seems that The Walrus had a flair for exaggeration.  While the path was truly winding, it really wasn't that long.\\n\\nTotal time up and back was 29:18.  Pretty easy hike.  This was my first of four mountains, one Saturday in April.",
        "We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "This place is pretty lively when we went. The atmosphere gave me a Dallas's vibe. The food was good. I had a chicken cesar salad. My friend got some shrimp pasta dish, that was pretty good. Must try their brownie. It's freshly made with your choice of ice cream on top. It's very good, but only when it is hot. When it gets cold, it won't taste as good. So eat it fast.",
        "I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SHOW. \\n\\nPlain and Simple.\\n\\nIt was AWESOME. \\n\\nLoved the interpretations, the symbols, the movements, the music, the costumes, the comedic relief. Zumanity showed all the different sides & angles in \\\"sex\\\"\\n\\nCant wait to go a 2nd time. This time Front Row Booth baby!",
        "Side dishes were good but the New York strip was the worst I ever had! Very disappointing this type of restaurant should be top notch- skip it.",
        "Great hot dogs! I had the Chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog, both were great! The fries were also good. The employees were friendly and the service was fast. The place was clean and in good order as well. Give it a try!",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order \\\"venti iced stirred caramel macchiato\\\" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed \\\"not stirred\\\" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer",
        "Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",

        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "My favorite food truck I've tried in the city! The hot dogs are unique, the people working are nice, and you definitely get enough food for $6. Try the Igby!",
        "Best steakhouse in Vegas. My wife and I come here almost everytime we are in Vegas and it is always amazing. We have tried all of the other top steakhouses on the strip but this place is much better with out the over doneness of the casinos and they dont rip you off. \\nSteaks are always cook perfectly and their sides are great.",
        "Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.",
        "The Linq is a \\\"mini strip\\\" between the quad and flamingo. It's composed of restaurants, bars, lounges, bowling and shops. a few are already open but still a lot to look forward to. Grand opening for most these places is going to be on the feb 28th. With the Highroller as it's main attraction. Largest observation wheel which is expected to be open on April.",
        "It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!",
        "We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre.",
        "Milunka is fabulous! She is gentle , sweet, and very informative. She takes her time to get to know your skin type and your daily activities. I am an acne sufferer and she knows exactly how to treat me and my face. My husband even goes to her now and he loves it. We have seen her twice and I highly recommend anyone who wants to get a facial to go and see Milunka!!",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!",
        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",
        "Good place to grab a quick lunch, weather you're looking for a slice of pizza, sandwich, or pasta.  Be sure to check out their daily specials!",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "I don't understand why the bar/snack register does not have the candy readily available or on display. The bartender had to leave her station to walk halfway across the theater to get our order making us late for the movie. Then it was quite warm inside the theater, enough to make me uncomfortable throughout the movie.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot. I had the Lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food. But good prices and decent food.",
        "This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!",
        "Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.",
        "If you want a pizza that's ready to pick up quickly this is not the place. Last 2 visits all I wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times I was told a 15-20 minute wait. Hot and ready?????? Obviously not. Staff isn't the nicest either",
        "This place is super delicious! Customer service is great, and the food is awesome. Simple, and delicious. \\n\\nI've tried basically everything on the menu, super yum. Pork tenderloins my fave! Level is usually 5, and its not bad at all. \\n\\nThey even got specials and side items around the restaurant. Look out what they are and try em too!",
        "Warm, friendly ....  nice and reliable and conveniently located inside PV Mall.",
        "Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \\\"hot\\\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.",
        "Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location.",
        "Love this place! Been to pretty much all the Pho spots in the valley and this spot is authentic. As for customer service, I really enjoy having my order taken and not being bothered while I enjoy my dinner HOT. Affordable, delicious and the broth is aaaamaazzziiiinnngggg.",
        "Good value. It's an older property but decent place and price was right at 180/night during peak season. Great atmosphere on the patio to enjoy a drink or meal. Beds were actually pretty good for an older place, they are definitely newer. Convenient location right off the freeway and tucked into the side of the mountain. Didn't get out for golf but played there before and remember it being good bit great. It's not Scottsdale but it's a great value.",
        "The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!",
        "Service Fry's & Fry's Marketplace FAIR enough.Price............HONEST so. Best for weekly  shopping like me...little but every Friday it got festive look.",
        "Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \\\"grunge\\\" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.",
        "Great for walking around in, The Prices are expensive for everything from Alcohol to Gelato to Watches and Various items. But it is the Forum shops and makes for a great time none the less to get out of the Hot Vegas Sun and look at things you may never afford or would want if you could afford it. Lots of good restaurants inside as well. Which range from reasonable to Take out a Second Mortgage on the house.",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",
        "Delicious!  Fresh baked goodies everyday!  Menu concept reminds me of Hash House A go-go but healthier!  Also, you pay cashier and pick up your drinks, then find a table.  Kind of weird service set up.  But food is worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back for lunch salads, i'll be back for sure!",
        "Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)",
        "Stopped in here just for the 5.00 Nathans hot dog, draw and chips. They have a condiment bar with about 30 toppings for the dogs. \\n\\nThe place itself it fairly nice, kind of a old school pub feel (lots of carved wood and nice couch/lounge areas.",
        "Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable",
        "If you are looking for a Young Israel, keep looking. This Kiruv centric,  Aish Shul is great for a weekend or two but don't move to this side of the city if you are Modern O or more observant, you'll get frustrated fast.",
        "Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.",
        "I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(",
        "Amazing Mexican restaurant! Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drink just WOW! So glad i discovered this gem. There dips are great, i had the enchilladas and there mojitos are great to beat the Vegas heat.\\nWill definately go back next time i am in Vegas.",
        "The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.",
        "Overpriced for quantity & quality of food.  Sandwich comes with nothing -- if you want fries, extra charge.  I ordered ravioli & requested alfredo sauce rather than marinara sauce (additional charge?!).  It also came with nothing except a piece of burnt garlic bread that I could not even eat.  Most places serve a side salad with a pasta entr\\u00e9e.  Service was slow.  Overall not the worst, but not worth going back to.",
        "Excellent coffee drinks. They also roast a variety of their own beans so when you buy those by the pound it makes for great coffee at home.  We are hooked!",
        "Steak was good. A little on the salty side but did the job. I would go back but would look at other options first.",
        "Went for Happy Hour.  Waited just about an hour for a california roll and a spicy tuna roll to get to our table.  Fish was warm by the time it arrived.  Overall it was gross, which was a shame because we have had good experiences at both the Scottsdale Quarter, and Old Town locations.",
        "It's been a very long time since we have eaten at Lupie's.  It was good, but I ordered the chili that is too hot and too thick.  They have others I should have chosen.  My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently.",
        "The cornbread ROCKS it every time.  It sort of reminds me of Thanksgiving corn casserole.  And it's free!\\n\\nI recently had the chili relleno and it was tasty but could have been heated up a bit more.",
        "This place was amazing! Impeccable timing out to order to table time with hot fresh is housed. The sauces are awesome. The ambiance is clean cannot say enough good things amazing specials lunch is only $5.99 with the drinks which is also just awesome!",
        "Closest off the strip reasonably priced JewFood in the Northwest side of the valley. Matzo ball soup and Pastrami spell comfort food. Like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in. Great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "\\\"Perfect Place to Have Breakfast and Lunch!\\\"\\n\\nThis restaurant is the perfect place to have a late breakfast and lunch. The food is always fresh and tasty.

        "Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame.",
        "I was told the rooms were renovated but was a basic clean up... Still has popcorn on the ceiling, clean but not anything fancy. Flat screen tv was terrible reception, heat and air is old and is loud and outdated. Very old casino that dates back to 1955 and is a good place to stay if you like vintage. Does not have a good filtration in the casinos and smoke is strong smelling. Would never, never stay here again... Never!",

        "Corn muffins were amazing and good service but nothing noteworthy here. I have traveled extensively throughout the south and always try to seek out new BBQ. Pork and ribs were good but not special. Sauces were unique but not something I wanted the recipe for. Sides were disappointing, green beans, mashed potatoes and barbecue beans in particular. Everything was over salted."

        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though.",
        "Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "My poor children who live out of state, have no idea how cheap and ugly the flowers I just received from Carmel Florist are. They do not resemble the online photo at all. I actually laughed at the gentleman who delivered them to my door. They spent $60 and they are not even worth $6. Shame on you for calling yourself a florist! I took photos just to prove what was delivered.",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",

        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "Had a craving for Indian food and Mount Everest was recommended by my cab driver. Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",
        "I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get.",

We both felt our bodies reset after our massages with her - and we agree it was one of our best massages ever. Yolanda was also a wonderful pedicurist - very warm personality and quick, efficient work. Definitely recommend these two folks and the Well Spa!",
        "A lot of people love the Mirage... I'm not a big fan. \\n\\nI like it there. It's okay. It's in a decent location, it has some good restaurants, some bars and other things, it just doesn't tickle my fancy much. Maybe it's the middle-aged vibe? It feels older. The crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out.",
        "Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.",
        "Never having has gellato before, this was definitely a lot easier on the wallet and feet than going over to the ice creamery on The Strip. Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",

        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!",

Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.",
        "Second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service. Staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand. Finally a server noticed and we were seated. Ten minutes went by and still no one came to greet us or get our drink order. I doubt I'll be back if they can't get on the ball with basic restaurant skills.",
        "I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old.",

Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.

        "I have to completely agree with Justin about the quality of food from Number 1 Brothers; it was one of the worst pizza experiences I've had.. and I gave them two chances. The 'cheez' is nasty and it seems like all of the toppings are either canned or jarred. Avoid!",

        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "One of those places you just go when you are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian because it's so convenient, has that menu item that every person in your party wants whether it be fake pho noodle soup or a burger, and you can crawl into the restaurant at 1:00am to satisfy your drunk hunger.... \\n\\nThe bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal.\\nThe service is really slow....",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "Happy Hour is the only time I come here, but for good reason!\\nYou can get 3 rolls for $15! Without a doubt my FAVORITE place to get sushi.\\n\\nRated a 4 instead of 5 because of the obnoxiously loud music - ask for the patio if you can brave the heat!",
        "Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.",
        "Guilt-free guilty pleasure. Great for those days when you want to eat something delicious without feeling greasy after. I had one of their panini's and and loved it. I wish they stayed open a little later.",
        "Definitely a cool spot, with a great downstairs bar. The decor upstairs is unique too. Serving Richardson's menu in the meantime, but something is missing when compared to Richardson's. I can't put my finger on it, but I don't get the same feeling. Worth visiting for sure.",
        "I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\\n\\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\\n\\nWe will definitely stay here again.",
        "The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.",
        "It was ok.... Over priced for some rogies, they were good but not the best I've ever had. . I'll give this place another chance tho. I really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends ...",
        "It is in a random location, way off the strip. \\n\\n+1 delish garlic fries\\n+1 really clean inside\\n+1 great prices\\n+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST\\n\\nI wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger.",
        "These guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago - The manger was the one that helped me - he was fantastic!",
        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "Food was very good! Great breakfast variety and lunch options as well. Love the dog friendly patio! Amanda was a great waitress! Very friendly :) I will definitely be coming back.",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",
        "Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!",
        "If you are a fan of Legume in the previous location, you should definitely experience the restaurant in their new digs.  There is a wonderful spaciousness, plus the same attention to detail.  Really great food with a farm to table sensibility, creativity, and delicious food.  The other thing that is new is a fabulous wine list with lots of great and surprising choices.  Highly recommended.",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "My favorite food truck I've tried in the city! The hot dogs are unique, the people working are nice, and you definitely get enough food for $6. Try the Igby!",
        "Do not go to the Sears on E Thomas Rd.  They missed two delivery dates, gave horrible customer service and were very rude. I finally gave up and cancelled my purchase of a washer and dryer. I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!",
        "Hip place.  A lot of wood accents. Very open.  Downtown. Decent menu. After seating it did take a while to get a water and some attention. Staff was friendly. Nice place for groups or maybe casual meeting. Overall decent place. Highlight\\nOf the visit! MACAROONS!!  salted caramel was delicious and will surely return STRICTLY for more macaroons.",
        "Went here expecting a delicious meal, but the food is considerably better at P.F. Changs and the stuffy borderline outright snobby attitude of every single staff member encountered terribly disappointed me. About the only thing I would go here for is the sake selection. Other than that, skip the restaurant, and maybe check out the nightclub.",
        "I never thought I'd like poutine, and I certainly don't want to eat it every day, but this stuff was really good. Get it with some bacon or sausage on top. Excellent for teenage boys.",
        "Five stars is for food only !! Hands down best pastrami I've ever had. Maybe best sandwich period. I got the pastrami Reuben on sourdough. The gentleman on the meat sliding station let me sample the corn beef and pastrami to see which I liked better. He was very friendly but the two girls working the other counters were frowning and not friendly. .  I will def be returning on my next Vegas trip.",
        "My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \\nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.",
        "Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the \\\"Motor\\\" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",
        "I was not impressed by this restaurant.The staff was friendly and the food was quick. However, the ingredients were not anything you couldn't throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost ( and personally this pizza lacked all flavor.) I most likely will not dine here again.",
        "They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good). \\n\\nAnyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",
        "It's certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places, but it really ought to go all the way to the airport.  Also, considering the short distance of travel, $5 is quite a lot.",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "of all the empanadas i tried (i got the after 10pm 6 for $9 deal), the only one that really didn't work for me was the pizza pepperoni one.  Pepperoni is meant to be eaten as garnish, not as a main ingredient.\\n\\nAnd yes, i ate all 6 in one sitting -- partly because i hadn't eaten all day and because my hotel room didn't have a microwave.",
        "Glad my husband and I decided to do brunch here. Really nice environment, friendly waiters and super yummy food. The french toast was so delicious. A little fancier than other breakfast places, they even brought out a foot stool for my handbag. I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town.",
        "Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\\n\\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\\n\\nOne word: disappointing.",
        "The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there.",
        "You can't beat an $8 Indian lunch buffet. However only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken. Besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely be stopping in again someday.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",
        "Went for dinner last night, they have closed.  Don't know if it's just a remodel or whether they are out of here...",
        "German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!",
        "This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!",
        "Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.",
        "A convenient location for me right of the 101, and quick service.  The prices seem reasonable but the few times I have been there I have noticed that there is typically some unfinished details on the wash.  Namely the glass does not come out too well.  \\n\\nThey are friendly about fixing it up and correcting anything unfinished.  I will probably keep using them and update the stars should their service become a little tighter on the details.",
        "Eh it was ok. I got grossed out by the sushi chefs not wearing gloves. It could of been the way their hands looked? I dunno! I am not sure if they should be wearing gloves?  I wasn't impressed by the sushi. The ambience was nice though!",
        "This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!",
        "Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price",
        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "Great place to watch sports as there are plenty of tv's, a great beer selection, but wished the food was better. It is not that the food is bad it is just so heavy and rich. If you eat an entire burger, you will be full for 2 days... Usually end up making what we call the \\\" hell fire nachos\\\" which is basically their hell fire chips covered with the buffalo chicken spread.",
        "Good value. It's an older property but decent place and price was right at 180/night during peak season. Great atmosphere on the patio to enjoy a drink or meal. Beds were actually pretty good for an older place, they are definitely newer. Convenient location right off the freeway and tucked into the side of the mountain. Didn't get out for golf but played there before and remember it being good bit great. It's not Scottsdale but it's a great value.",
        "I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "Verdict: Good before, but \\\"meh\\\" now. \\n\\nThis place was pretty good and always gave us exactly what we ordered, but now they give us half the portions of what we used to get. \\n\\nI don't know if maybe they recently changed owners, but we won't be coming back here anymore.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "I did not like this ice cream. I had a few bites - threw it away. Didn't have the flavor/texture of the real deal. It looked like ice cream, had all the proper attributes of ice cream... but it wasn't. Maybe its an Asian take on what we know as ice cream? Me no likey.",
        "Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to."

        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",

The long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few. Overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars.",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",
        "Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.",
        "This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "Freed's Bakery made ordering a custom cake a breeze! It was a week before my friends and I would be going to vegas to celebrate a birthday. They made a delicious red velvet cake and delivered it to the restaurant w/ no hiccups!\\n\\nWe ordered a red velvet cake w/ irish bailey filling and butter cream frosting. The cake was so moist, the girls and I devoured it.\\n\\nthanks for everything!",
        "Try the paloma! From the people who brought you Bramble, there is a new kid in town. Lovely little place on Queen street where they choose your cocktails for you based around what you like drinking.\\nWe all loved our drinks and the service was great",
        "A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "When I purchased a used Dell from Foxetech Alex was great to work with.  I give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget.  He as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades.",
        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \\n\\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though....",
        "I have been with sprint for 10 plus years..I have never had a 4G phone with fast service.. I use to pay for it each month.. They have been saying the same shit for 5 years the towers are not up yet.. Don't buy it.",
        "Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again.",
        "Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.",
        "This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love.",
        "What an amazing night! Myself and my wife celebrated our 1 year anniversary here and what a great choice. My wife loves a new menu experience and Virtu has that plus amazing drinks. Great BandB and awesome ambience.",
        "Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls. \\nThe reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately.",
        "Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!",
        "Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "Small portions & expensive. Waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu or drinks. My specialty drink was suppose to have candy in it... It didn't. Lasagna was tiny.. Pizza was okay. I didn't mind it.. Nothing special tho.",
        "Good food...but the service when doing 'carry out' orders is quite slow. Give yourself an extra 20 mins or so after they say it'll be ready. I know this place is popular, so maybe that's why I guess. Anyway, maybe someone else will have a better experience. (Please note this review was based on a few experiences throughout this past spring/summer and could of been resolved by now, I just wanted people to be aware of the possibility)",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah.  They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day!  I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",
        "Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\\nWe both got sick after.",
        "Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \\\"to go\\\"\\n\\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",
        "Great sushi and service.  The 5th star just being held back because of the high prices.  Incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online.",
        "Usually when I expect something to be amazing it sucks. This place was actually as good as I thought it would be. I ordered the famous chicken and waffles :) good stuff...between my sis and I we barely finished it. The place is good.. def worth a try and I def would go again when I'm in Vegas.",
        "Was at the Vig on a Friday night for dinner with a friend.  We were greeted several times from valet, hostess, manager, all promptly, all so friendly :) Service was nice.  Food and drinks were very good.  Best thing about it was the vibe.  Sitting outside at the Arcadia location, had a more downtown vibe, a chill spot.  Would def go again!",
        "Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here.  While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there.  Both items were paid for but had to be ordered.  The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item.  Won't be back in...",
        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",
        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",
        "The food was ok, ordered couple of appetizers, dinner and wine was thinking it was going to be great, but I was not impressed at all! Place was nice and clean, Server was nice..\\nI don't think I would ever come back here, but I can atlest say I tried it .",
        "This is the worst place to go.. Crawfish was so small and dry... Crab legs had no taste... It took them forever to make food as well.\\nBetter go seafood supermarket and buy some live crabs and boil them.",
        "Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",
        "Waited 10 minutes in DT for 3 sandwiches that were cold when I got them, the Mexican in the window only told me to have a good day when I asked what took 10 minutes for me to get my food... 3 other cars that ordered all drove off before I got my food! Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",
        "The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The \\\"homemade\\\" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.",
        "Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no\\nEVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses",
        "Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,",
        "I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.",
        "We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.",
        "Good bar for the location and size. This would be a good place to get started for the night. I ended up standing by the bar and getting carded when I asked for water. Blech. Drinks were yummy and there was a little room to dance. \\n\\nThe stage above the bar was AWESOME. It was especially nice that there was a hot chick on mic. Fun stuff when you've been drinking.",
        "My son and I had lunch at the Cubs game and was sadly disappointed. We both had the Pita Tri Tip and waited 26 minutes after we ordered for some stale bread and three small shavings of meat. When done eating, my son asked if I enjoyed my bread and onion sandwich.",
        "Great drinks.   Awesome music and environment.   Ribs are tough which is unfortunate.   But satisfied with experience.",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",
        "Hint: reservation a must\\nCrowded; great value for all-you-eat-pasta; small $ supplement for sausage, meatballs, chicken\\nFriendly & cool food service by Linzy\\nNice small dessert sampler\\nDelish pumpkin cheese cake\\nWine & beer",
        "Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle.",
        "Decent venue, well run, drinks are about what you'd expect. Overall you need to go when there is a good DJ, we had some second rate DJs who aren't local, but aren't good. It was a fun time, but the music needs to be much better to really enjoy it.",
        "This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\\n\\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I've always loved Bahama bucks and never had a problem. But today I ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice. This is ridiculous...",
        "Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service",
        "Waste of time to sell clothes.. Brought what they wanted.. A&F, gap, F21, Armani exchange, juicy, JBrand, Zara, etc.. Out of 2 garbage bags full of barely used name brand clothes they bought ONE sweater for a dollar and wanted to buy my Kooba bag for $5, which i paid around $700 for. However the staff is very friendly and a good place to shop if you have the time.",
        "Tried with a Groupon. Suprised to be allowed to use multiple Groupons in one visit.  However, not allowed to purchase any specials with the Groupons (e.g half price chicken fingers).  Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "Not the biggest, baddest or hottest strip club in town but for a night out with my friends it was fun.  Plenty of good looking girls, not too pushy and very friendly.  Dances were decent for $10, some girls were much better at it then others.  Drinks were typically overpriced, just like any other strip club.  When there's another night out with the guys...I'll make sure to bring this place up again.",
        "This place is terrible - now I see why there were so many empty seats in the place. My daughter ordered the taquitos - totally pre frozen - for sure not home made!  My husband ordered a fajita combo w/ short ribs - TERRIBLE - it pretty much went untouched. I ordered the chicken tacos - they didn't taste too bad, but boy does my tummy hurt now!  We would have been better off driving to Elmer's Tacos!",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "Do not go to the Sears on E Thomas Rd.  They missed two delivery dates, gave horrible customer service and were very rude. I finally gave up and cancelled my purchase of a washer and dryer. I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!",
        "Great burgers, love to make my own salad. I always do the create your own small salad as a meal and it's plenty. Kids like the sliders and fried pickles. The kids love their milkshakes and I have to admit they are really good. Burgers always are cooked right and flavorful.  All of the ingredients are fresh...this is one of our go to places.  It also has a full bar and drinks that have some bang!",
        "Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.",
        "For a \\\"clean\\\" restaurant they sure cut corners and give you nasty food. I ordered the mango mint salad and it was supposed to have grilled chicken and sweet onions, yet the meat looked like cheap cold cuts and the onions looked like they came from a jar. The \\\"grilled\\\" chicken was literally cold cuts. The avocado looked like it has been sitting out all day. Needless to say, I won't be eating here again.",
        "So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!",
        "Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  \\nThe Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",
        "Ordered a meal for pickup, went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it.",
        "Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Sushi was awesome.  We had the Philly, Naruto, Rainbow, Spicy Tuna rolls.  The seviche was fantastic.  Drinks are well priced and the variety is great.  I will go back often, one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.  You can't go wrong with Tamari.",
        "This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.",
        "I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.",
        "I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",
        "Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed",
        "This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!",
        "The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.",
        "This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out.",
        "Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "We were exploring the city and decided to stop in...we opted for the roof top seating and loved it.  Food, service and drinks were all GREAT!!!  The roof top seating was fun!!!  It was a great time!",
        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!",
        "Most authentic tacos outside of Mexico. \\nNevertheless, #SrGORDO please fix your ordering system. Long lines ruin the experience.",
        "Went last night. Keep in mind I've been here dozens of times.  Our server didn't give a hoot about our table of five. We ordered the pickles and they were slimy. Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like \\\"hi! Um.....nooooo\\\". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky \\\"manager\\\"."

My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "Do not eat here.  We had the scallop roll and there was a funky scent to it like it went bad.  They still served it to us.  I refused to eat it.  I also noticed that the slices of cucumber sitting with the raw fish looked like it was several days old.  This place should not offer raw seafood.  From what I saw and smelled I'm not sure if they follow food safety protocols.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",

        "The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place.",
        "We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.",
        "decent... i had the \\\"sin city\\\" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers....",
        "Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \\n\\nKey is to call ahead.\\n\\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.",
        "This is the worst place to go.. Crawfish was so small and dry... Crab legs had no taste... It took them forever to make food as well.\\nBetter go seafood supermarket and buy some live crabs and boil them.",
        "Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",
        "Always love going to CPK. There three of us. The salad and spaghetti was excellent. Took awhile to get served, bread and a waitress. She was looking right through me as I recited my order, was slow and just not interested. I'd still go back though.",
        "This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.",
        "I love this place and so do my kids!  Tonight I went for fishing gear for the kids.  This is an area I know nothing about.  Brad in the fishing department was very friendly and very helpful.  He spent a good 10-15 minutes with me helping me to pick out the right trout fishing equipment.   Thanks Brad!\\n\\nThis place caters to kids with activities for them on Tuesday nights and occasionally on weekends.  Check out their website.",
        "Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \\n\\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side. My fellow diners reported the same impression.\\n\\nI'll definitely give them some more tries as I think this restaurant has got potential and is reasonably priced with a pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little bit cramped.",
        "Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.",
        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "Organized a business breakfast here and was impressed by how attentive and efficient the service was. We were seated at a great table facing the windows. I really liked the little chair they offered for purses, too cute.\\n\\nI had the duck hash & eggs which was delicious, although the pancakes looked great too. Tableau is perfectly classy and elegant, yet casual at the same time.",
        "The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it.",
        "Best LFS in Town!!! Very friendly  staffs... James & Jorell are very helpful!! Whatever fish you would like to find... They will try their hardest to find you the rare/special fish.... Case in point.. They got me a Black Tang.  I have been looking for so long... Thanks guys!!!",
        "This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "I don't like giving 5's, so a 4, nice to have a Guinness, and a Guinness stew. Wife had a Sheppard's pie and was happy. Should use real mash potatoes. Servings on the large size. The fish and chips could help feed the 5000. For Vegas not bad value. Good selection of beers.",
        "Horrible salsa and awful, stale chips. Mediocre fish tacos and they don't have black beans! Seriously?",
        "Great donuts and open 24/7.  I love their buttermilk donuts and they have these adorable little filled donut holes.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.\\n\\nDecent collards, however.",
        "The bartending staff at Irish wolfhound is always working hard to make sure everyone feels welcome. especially after a long day at my restaurant it feels nice to come in and be recognized because they always know our names and what we usually drink it feels like our version of cheers. Dirty bird forever! !!!!",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "The Sunset Caf\\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff.",
        "This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.",
        "Cheap food and booze? Im in!\\n\\nGot to love Firefly for many reasons besides the cheap dishes and booze! The atmosphere, people and servers make it all meld together perfectly.\\n\\nMost dishes here are delicious and the one i was particularly fond of was the lamb chops! Two for about $10?! Amazing! \\n\\nCheck out my Firefly food pictures among other on my Instagram! @dentalgaymer",
        "This is the best \\\"East Coast Style\\\" Chinese food I have found in the area, and believe me, I have tried several. Wonton soup is fantastic. A large feeds 3 people. There's 10 wonton in a large. The sweet and sour pork is amazeballs. My bf tried the beef lo mein. He loved it. Mmmm, can't wait to go back again.",
        "This place is super delicious! Customer service is great, and the food is awesome. Simple, and delicious. \\n\\nI've tried basically everything on the menu, super yum. Pork tenderloins my fave! Level is usually 5, and its not bad at all. \\n\\nThey even got specials and side items around the restaurant. Look out what they are and try em too!",
        "Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "This place is extremely good.  It is the second best Indian resturant in Vegas.  The first being Namaste.   It is not a hole in the wall just in an off strip location.  This is where the locals eat!",
        "While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!",
        "Im a sucker for a good Hole in the Wall...and this totally fit the bill. \\n\\nSuper nice, and very sexy bartenders sling very strong and inexpensive drinks. Not on the path for the normal Vegas tourist, but totally a place id be happy to visit again.",
        "Not bad for a local fish fry.  I had Steve's platter and the portion was plenty for each item.  The wife had a two item combo and had more oysters than anyone could assume in one setting.  The kids enjoyed the kid menu items.  We had about a 25 min wait that was not expect, but went fairly quickly as they moved consumers in and out quickly.",
        "Great Peking Duck & Chinese Sausage Fried Rice!  Nice restaurant inside and great service.",
        "We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.",
        "amazing food, i loved the kobe burger, and the lobster mash potatoes. . . everything was well cooked",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",
        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",
        "Second to Hurley's for good pub grub on lunch. Fish n Chips - with really tasty chips. Stews, burgers, beer, etc. Don't expect fine dining here but expect so much better than those disgusting chain Pubs like Les 3 Brasseurs. One is function over form, the other is form over function. Good honest grub. A few years back I had ribs and they were AWESOME. Great to have right next to the office.",
        "My husband and I attended Chef Alyssa's Dressed Up Game Day class in September. What a cool venue and a very fun date night! We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed meeting the other members of our kitchen team that night. We have already made the sweet potato wedges twice  since the class and are looking forward to making the baked wings (SO GOOD!) soon. We are looking forward to booking another class soon- maybe with some friends this time.",
        "The music is a little too loud, but their food is so good. Their burger with the lobster and asparagus is my favorite meal on the menu. Love it!",
        "The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \\n\\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return.",
        "For the money its not worth it.  I have had better meals at King's Fish House.  The arrogance in the air was hard to stomach and I was not impressed with the food.\\n\\nNothing was bad, but for 300 plus dollars I would expect to feel like it was all incredible.\\n\\nUnless someone else is picking up the tab on this one, I'm in no hurry to venture back.",
        "Seriously one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Ordered the Wellington, chorizo stuffed lobster tail, onion soup, green salad & rib eye. All absolutely amazing! Service was awesome place was cool worth every penny. If you are havin hard time thinking prices are high it's def worth it. Will go back my next Vegas trip!",
        "I'm not sure what the hype is all about. We had the chicken & waffles, duck confit poutine, and a BLT. The BLT and poutine were both fine / mediocre. For me, the chicken and waffles with mustard seeds in the syrup was revolting. The decor and staff here are cool, but I regret eating here.",
        "Good & decent lunch specials! However, I had to knock a couple stars because waitress came to our table at least 3 times & did not bother to fill water glasses. And we had to remind her for our roll that comes with lunch entre\\u00e8! Fish was ok, not that fresh!",
        "Whoever the owner or guy is In charge there is the man. The first time I went i did the all you can eat sushi. Pretty good. The second time I went I did the BBQ. Short ribs and pork belly. Amazing. Third time. BBQ again. Short ribs. And the marinated pork. Next time maybe a couple sushi rolls and two orders of the short ribs.",
        "I just ate the most expensive but the best burger ever in my life. $60 burger sounds crazy but it is totally worth it. You can taste each layer of ingredient of the burger. Foie gras, truffle, kobe beef are the best combination for burger. Fried zucchini and sweet potato fries are really good. My wife had Blackjack burger and it's very good.  Highly recommended.",
        "Delicious chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies! Sometimes I indulge in their crab rangoons, too...tasty little morsels!",
        "One word. BOMB. 1st timer at a Greek mediterranean restaurant all though I had Gyros b4. Found out I been pronouncing it wrong this hole time but let's get to the point. Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way.",
        "You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!",
        "Went for Happy Hour.  Waited just about an hour for a california roll and a spicy tuna roll to get to our table.  Fish was warm by the time it arrived.  Overall it was gross, which was a shame because we have had good experiences at both the Scottsdale Quarter, and Old Town locations.",
        "Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.",
        "Great place to hang out for a few beers and some pool, darts or fooseball. Jake is an awesome bartender making the experience even better. It's great for bigger groups and the owner came around to say hi too, very nice guy. Didn't try the food but the Goose Island IPA is great.",
        "It was just \\\"OK\\\". In a strip mall. I think it caters to the younger, movie-going crowd. The food was bland. I had to wait over 10 minutes for salmon teryaki. I did not like the fact everything was served in styrofoam everything.  I will not go back.",
        "Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast.",
        "If you like Joe's Crab Shack ... then maybe this is your funky Medina.\\n\\nNoisy cramped environment with Chinese quality seafood served in a plastic bag that you open and eat directly off the table with your fingers. \\n\\nYa... Hoo!\\n\\nIts just not my ... bag!",
        "I had the jambalaya and it was very good. GF had the fish and pasta, she loved it. Only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering us.\\n\\notherwise the drinks are great, the food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was very calm!",
        "Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks.",
        "This is the worst food I have ever had. Smelly Salmon, mushy broccoli, saw dust dry burger, rock hard ribs. Even the mashed potatoes were thick and dry. I understand this place's forte' is rock memorabilia, they should at least provide palatable food, not saw dust. They would be better off serving TV dinners. Stay away from this place. if you must go, then just have some appetizers and leave.",
        "I have been in this restaurant for 2 times and tried their Lamb Sandwich, Baba Ganouj and Shawarma Chicken. They are all very delicious. Next time I will try Sleek which has kale inside. It looks really tasty and servings are large. Waitstaff is nice and helpful. Decor is cozy. I can't wait to go there again and try other dishes.",
        "Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas. We really enjoy the beet selection of my favorite beers was the Fullers ESB it's English and went perfectly with my meal. We were one very happy couple and will be returning soon .",
        "Their pizza is good for the first few bites and then it gets old. The meat kinda smells weird. It grossed me out while I was eating it. The pork belly sandwich was so salty I couldn't eat it, and the service was horrendous. They were nice to us, until they completely forgot to service us. We stopped three people other than our server to try and get what we needed. I'm not coming back.",
        "so sorry I didn't consult Yelp first.  all reviews are spot on - including the beer listed on the menu that isn't available....  Service was pleasant I guess but the food just sucked.  Perhaps if you go for the all you can eat snow crab legs you'll be happy but I don't recommend the other stuff.  Even the rice wasn't cooked properly.",
        "Corn muffins were amazing and good service but nothing noteworthy here. I have traveled extensively throughout the south and always try to seek out new BBQ. Pork and ribs were good but not special. Sauces were unique but not something I wanted the recipe for. Sides were disappointing, green beans, mashed potatoes and barbecue beans in particular. Everything was over salted.",
        "Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\\n\\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house.",
        "One helluva view and fantastic jalape\\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!",

        "Tip...go for a really late lunch, (3:30pm or so) and hang around for the dinner selections that come out about 4:30pm. \\n\\nReally nice buffet! Great variety of selections! \\n\\nThe crab legs were a bit salty. \\n\\nVery friendly/helpful staff!",

My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.",

Started off with a chicken tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection, i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor. I then had some butter chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor. I did enjoy the naan bread however which was fluffy and soft. Needless to say- i did not take the leftovers.",

Close to my house and filled with several unique flavors (avocado,  parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, etc.), I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that cares to ask.\\n\\nAlso, if you follow her on one of her social media websites,  she posts a Flavor of the Day.",
        "Another Thai surprise. I did have the Som Tum and it was just OK. They used string beans instead of long beans. The dressing was not balanced enough for my taste. It could have used less lime and more fish sauce. \\n\\nA pretty decent curry, nice green tea. Definitely an OK place",
        "Not what I expected. It almost looked like a starbucks when I walked in BUT BOY WAS I WRONG Best coffee I have ever had! Beautiful foam designs on every coffee..

        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",

If we lived here we could eat there again but alas there is no Oreganos in Fresno, CA.",

Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",

Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. \\nAlthough service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery... Overall poor quality or just old food! \\nToo bad because this place looks nice and clean but they just need new cooks and recipes??!",

        "Not the biggest, baddest or hottest strip club in town but for a night out with my friends it was fun.  Plenty of good looking girls, not too pushy and very friendly.  Dances were decent for $10, some girls were much better at it then others.  Drinks were typically overpriced, just like any other strip club.  When there's another night out with the guys...I'll make sure to bring this place up again.",

There is a wonderful spaciousness, plus the same attention to detail.  Really great food with a farm to table sensibility, creativity, and delicious food.  The other thing that is new is a fabulous wine list with lots of great and surprising choices.  Highly recommended.",
        "I truly enjoyed my experience at Tandoor. The staff was super friendly, the flavors were both fresh and savory. You must order the Samosa's and  garlic naan to start. My curry chicken was also very satisfying. \\nI betcha didn't know they have free WiFi! ;) So get cozy and stay awhile! Don't forget, it's BYOB.",
        "This is one of the best burger places in town! If you love burgers and Asian inspired dishes...This is your place. They take your typical American burger and kick it up a notch with great asian flavor. On top of that, they always have great service!",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "This was our first time trying Mickey's Tavern. I had the Eggplant Panino and the boyfriend had the Mickey burger. We upgraded to try the sexy fries and super sexy fries. We were both wildly impressed by everything. High quality meal for awesome prices and a fun chill vibe on a Monday evening. I guess some guys get together every Monday to jam- we left before they started but it was a very friendly environment.",
        "Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Sushi was awesome.  We had the Philly, Naruto, Rainbow, Spicy Tuna rolls.  The seviche was fantastic.  Drinks are well priced and the variety is great.  I will go back often, one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.  You can't go wrong with Tamari.",
        "Glad my husband and I decided to do brunch here. Really nice environment, friendly waiters and super yummy food. The french toast was so delicious. A little fancier than other breakfast places, they even brought out a foot stool for my handbag. I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town.",
        "Tobacco Town is a cigar shop off the 215 and Rainbow across from the Best Buy.  This cigar shop also offers a good selection of pipe tobacco and even hookahs(?).  A little off your traditional cigar shop with the hookah thing, but hey, they have a decent size humidor and look to be adding to the store weekly.  Keep them in mind if your on that side of town and looking for a cigar.",
        "Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar.",
        "The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.",
        "Not the best sevice i've been offered. But I like this place's pho the best.\\nI like that it has less smell of whatever it is in the usual pho. Clean taste of soup, lots of meats, and noodles. Noodle is usually overcooked but it is better than being undercooked. \\nI love their egg rolls too.\\nGreat place to try pho if it's your first one.",
        "As a players card member, I am so incredibly disappointed in this casino. After playing for about 10 minutes at the table and quitting to cash in my meager winnings, I was forced to wait for at least 10 minutes in line for the cashier. For such a large casino, it is unconscionable to have only three windows open for cashing in chips. And to see the number of people idle behind the closed windows was even more infuriating. Gamble elsewhere.",
        "This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!",
        "I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",
        "This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and had the best time. \\nBest bartenders -so attentive and great. Made the best drinks. \\nDelicious food! I mean so tasty! \\nGreat atmosphere. \\nAll in all -LOVE THIS PLACE!",
        "Great place to watch sports as there are plenty of tv's, a great beer selection, but wished the food was better. It is not that the food is bad it is just so heavy and rich. If you eat an entire burger, you will be full for 2 days... Usually end up making what we call the \\\" hell fire nachos\\\" which is basically their hell fire chips covered with the buffalo chicken spread.",
        "Service was great. The server was very friendly and knowledgable. Soup was pretty good. For the entrees i had the  Pollo Rosa Maria Stuffed with fontina and prosciutto, topped with mushrooms and a basil lemon butter sauce. Really great dish. My friend karlee had the manicotti. She liked it. We also had this chocolate bread pudding. I have to admit it was good as well even though im not a huge chocolate fan.",
        "I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.",
        "Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.",

        "Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  \\n\\nThe store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.",
        "We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.",
        "Love this place! Lettuce wraps amazing! Egg rolls so good! Love the passion tea! Good service good food good times. This location is not as busy as some of the others so it's a great place on a Friday night!",

The owner, John Morris, is a veteran of the paint industry.  The guys that work for him are smart, efficient, careful and quick. My home looks brand new and the best part is they offer a 10 year warranty on their workmanship and materials. Stop by and take a look.  They are the best !!!",
        "Everything but the Kal-bi was delicious, but then again it is a tofu house.  It would give any garden grove area tofu restaurants a run for their money.  Kal-bi was good, just needed to be seasoned more.  Bim bim bop was very good; fresh ingredients.  Banchan was fresh and tasty also.  Great Korean place in Vegas!",
        "We frequent Antonio's on a regular basis, and they are hands down the best pizza-by-the-slice in town! \\n\\nThey make a variety of unique and creative pizzas- that are always served fresh. Spicy Beef Taco, Chicken Florentine, and Chicken, Bacon, Ranch- just to name a few. My go-to slice is the Chicken Quesadilla! Absolutely delish!",
        "In town on business and was looking for some sushi to end my evening. Atmosphere was fine the sushi chefs were very personable and willing to make special requests. The result ......the rolls were good not great.  The price was fair.  Cucumber salad was outstanding. Miso soup was okay. And of course the beer was perfect.",
        "These cupcakes are extremely nasty. They taste like they are made from a box mix. I can buy 4 boxes of mix for the cost of 1 cupcake. Me thinks not. The cake is extremely dry and the icing is overly sweet, in my opinion. There are other cupcake places in town that are miles better than this one is. \\nI wouldnt recommend this place to a person without a tongue.",

        "Went here for a few cocktails last Saturday night and the sofas are comfy, the cocktails damn tasty and the nachos were lovely. The jug of water for the table had an orange wedge and hibiscus flowers in it, yet this seemed more like a touch of attention to detail rather than pretension. When a place is that classy and yet seems totally laid back, it's a place to go back to!",
        "You need to go here!  They have an amazing menu full of breakfast classics that you'd expect, but they also mix things up a bit by offering some of those same classics with a twist like the Southern Waffle with an egg, cheese, sour cream, and salsa,  or Eggs Benedict with crab meat served on a waffle. SO GOOD!",
        "Went for Happy Hour.  Waited just about an hour for a california roll and a spicy tuna roll to get to our table.  Fish was warm by the time it arrived.  Overall it was gross, which was a shame because we have had good experiences at both the Scottsdale Quarter, and Old Town locations.",
        "A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.",
        "Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  \\nA few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!.",
        "I think this is one of the best brunch buffets in town.  They have the make your own omelet station and great eggs and a fantastic dessert selection.  Also, the champagne for the mimosas was good too.  This place was so good, my petite little roommate ate here for 3 hours.  (Suffice it to say, she was in a food coma for a good part of the day.)  That's some good eating...",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Seating at late evening was poorly done as no hastiest was there to seat you.  We were told sit where you want;  after 10 min, the waiter for that area said he was getting off and we needed to move.  Pricy for what you get, will look elsewhere next time I'm in town.",
        "The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.",
        "We got take out here. I had the orange chicken which was pretty good. The fried rice looked like white rice with some soy sauce. No veggies and only a few pieces of egg- pretty disappointing (maybe I ordered wrong) but overall taste was good. My husband had egg drop soup and general tso's chicken. He enjoyed his meal. We will be back here - just probably won't get the fried rice again.",
        "Love this place, great Thai food. We ordered Panang, Egg Rolls, Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Everything was amazing except the Pad Thai. They use really thin noodles, which I've not seen before. It wasn't my favorite, but everything else was delicious. I would definitely go back!",
        "I've only been here once and that was on a Thursday while a 90's rock cover band was playing. The band was way beyond fun (I honestly would have still enjoyed myself while sober) and being able to play beer pong added to the excitement.",
        "This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \\n\\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \\n\\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.",
        "Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \\n\\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\\n\\nGet in here!!",
        "Sweet little spot situated perfectly between the ball field and US Airways Center.

The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",

The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "Waste of time to sell clothes.. Brought what they wanted.. A&F, gap, F21, Armani exchange, juicy, JBrand, Zara, etc.. Out of 2 garbage bags full of barely used name brand clothes they bought ONE sweater for a dollar and wanted to buy my Kooba bag for $5, which i paid around $700 for. However the staff is very friendly and a good place to shop if you have the time.",
        "It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\\n\\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me.",
        "Queen Creek Olive Mill has delicious sandwiches, gelato, and of course, olive and balsamic vinegar products. I wouldn't come here for breakfast because it's pretty standard fare, but the sandwiches are great. It's a little bit pricey, but it's a nice experience.",

        "So a few weeks ago I decided to break down and give Hanshiktaco another try. The food was okay. Not horrible and not great. I'm sticking with my one star, because the entire time I was waiting for my food the owner was bashing Yelp and Urbanspoon. I really don't appreciate people talking #$&! when I'm buying food from them. Will NOT be going back!",
        "Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\\u00e9s. Portions g\\u00e9n\\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!",
        "The Sunset Caf\\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff.",
        "Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)",
        "I wish I'd read the Yelp reviews prior to stopping in to Pepe's. The super burrito was anything but \\\"super\\\". The carne asada was more like tiny minced meat and the size of the burrito should've been listed as puny, especially for the price.\\n\\nThe wife's breakfast burrito was no better and she could barely eat it. Never, never, never again.",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.",
        "Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed",
        "Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.",
        "Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \\nIt wasn't horrible.",
        "While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!",
        "Best Chai Latte in town. We had a chocolate twist and a quiche lorraine. Both very light and delicious. Brought home a ciabatta boule, which was much more moist than we are used to but very good.",
        "I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Loved it! Went here on a Sunday a.m. And took full advantage of the heated chairs, whirlpool, sauna, rainshower and steam room before my treatment. Had the Bacial and it was very nice. Smelled wonderful everywhere. I would do this every year on race day :)",
        "I picked this lunch buffet because of the decent rating from Yelp!  \\n\\nThe price is $35.99 per person\\n\\nOverall, the choice of foods variety is somewhat limited with what other competitors offering.  Foods are so-so.  With this kind of price, I would go for Wicked Spoon at least they have good desserts.",
        "This place is ghetto assf#*k! There are methers, prostitutes and scum that frequent this place, they do offer a AAA discount that brings the total to around $50 after tax. If you need a place to stay this will do, just don't leave your valuables in your vehicle.\\n\\nGood luck",
        "Everything but the Kal-bi was delicious, but then again it is a tofu house.  It would give any garden grove area tofu restaurants a run for their money.  Kal-bi was good, just needed to be seasoned more.  Bim bim bop was very good; fresh ingredients.  Banchan was fresh and tasty also.  Great Korean place in Vegas!",
        "great food and Yoyo gives the best service!",
        "The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \\n\\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return.",
        "AC just died on Sunday and after looking at Yelp I found these guys with glowing reviews. I see why. They were consistant on what time they would be there and they diagnosed the issue quickly. They were informative and friendly. That is a great way to recieve repeat business. Hope the AC doesnt fail anymore this summer but if it does Im calling the Flores'",
        "10/29/13 - Edit - Since my last edit I've been to Sleepy dog many times and they've continued to shine. The menu has been revamped with quality made from scratch food, the staff seems to know what they're doing as I haven't had a long wait for anything. I can say that Sleepy Dog has changed my opinion about their brewbub, changing my review to 4 stars. I highly recommend a pint of Red Rover!",

        "Overpriced for quantity & quality of food.  Sandwich comes with nothing -- if you want fries, extra charge.  I ordered ravioli & requested alfredo sauce rather than marinara sauce (additional charge?!).  It also came with nothing except a piece of burnt garlic bread that I could not even eat.  Most places serve a side salad with a pasta entr\\u00e9e.  Service was slow.  Overall not the worst, but not worth going back to.",
        "Waste of money, I went with 4 friends and all of us were falling asleep.",

        "It's been a very long time since we have eaten at Lupie's.  It was good, but I ordered the chili that is too hot and too thick.  They have others I should have chosen.  My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently.",
        "I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\\n\\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience.",
        "A bit dissappointing.  I have no idea how anybody would rate this place higher than a 3/5.  For those with a 5/5, what are you thinking?  All I can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp.",
        "This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \\nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.",
        "Sweet little spot situated perfectly between the ball field and US Airways Center.  Never heard of it but it got great reviews on Yelp so we gave it a whirl before the Lady Gaga show.  \\n\\nThe Hatch mac n' cheese was extremely tasty and my friend's nachos looked delish.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Extremely reasonably priced too!",
        "I have been in this restaurant for 2 times and tried their Lamb Sandwich, Baba Ganouj and Shawarma Chicken. They are all very delicious. Next time I will try Sleek which has kale inside. It looks really tasty and servings are large. Waitstaff is nice and helpful. Decor is cozy. I can't wait to go there again and try other dishes.",
        "Service was wonderful ! We ordered beef cheeks stew which literally melts in your mouth and my husband has fish n chips flaky crispy batter with the delicious peas.

        "Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob.. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well. Stick to a gyro, had that last time and it was golden. Seems like good people, they are nice.",
        "I went to this place after I saw the pics from yelp, but when I got there they gave me a total different menu. Apparently they sold the place a few months ago and  they no longer sell  the same items. their lunch special is about 8-10 dollars. The food took a while  to arrive and they told me they run out of some ingredients. I would not recommend this place",
        "so sorry I didn't consult Yelp first.  all reviews are spot on - including the beer listed on the menu that isn't available....  Service was pleasant I guess but the food just sucked.  Perhaps if you go for the all you can eat snow crab legs you'll be happy but I don't recommend the other stuff.  Even the rice wasn't cooked properly.",
        "Jumbo Jacks and their milkshakes are the two main reasons for me visiting Jack In The Box. This has been true since I was in college.

        "Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy.",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",

        "I ordered a chicken salad from this place last night and it was below average. The chicken was warm, but definitely not hot. And the french fries on the salad were cold. \\n\\nWhile the portion size was quite large, it was     a very poor product. The only reason I ordered from this place is because it is pretty cheap (even cheaper with a coupon code on Grubhub), but it definitely wasn't worth the $7 I paid.",

        "I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok.",
        "This hotel was just terrible. The room they checked us into had fixtures falling off the wall, no phone and no working light! When we complained, they put us in a room not much better. Would rather camp in the parking lot!",
        "Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts.",
        "Yes this place is absolutely our \\\"Must Have Breakfast\\\" spot whenever we are in Vegas!! We always order the Corn Beef Hash, best i've ever had! I must say though, since Yelp, this hole in the wall spot has become extremely popular (or shall I say crowded). The last time we were here, the waitress was a bit overwhelmed with customers however, she did handle it like a champ :)",
        "Came here for lunch with my family friends about 17 of us.  Great value for the price.  A variety of Filipino dishes and all tasted excellent.  Had the dinuguan, Kare Kare, sinagang,  beef steak, tocino, beef mechado, pork adobo, and a few others.  Definitely will be going here next time I'm in Vegas again.",
        "Food's pricey & the men's bathroom is run down (the paper towel dispenser fell off the wall).  I like their fried chicken but my buddy wasn't impressed.  Don't bother with the shrimp fried rice which has the shrimp the size of krill.\\n\\nAt least the waitresses are friendly & your table having a buzzer button to call for a waitress is handy.",
        "I thought about giving this place 3 stars until we ate at Tony Romas and realized that their BBQ just wasn't that good.  Not that I wouldn't return but I'd much rather go someplace else.\\nMy pork ribs were meaty but dry and not very tender.  The fried okra was very old and soggy, with the coating all destroyed.\\nThe honey butter was good and so was the service.",
        "It's not a nightclub it's a small casino w/ really dim/dark lighting and boring crowd!.Music was good but a tiny cheap,empty looking dance floor.felt like i was in a home library..i just wanted to fall asleep!.Anyways we left after 15 boring minutes and went to ghostbar which was way livelier.",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",

        "Moving from Chicago - the land of awesome Italian food - I'm so happy I found this place on a groupon. Bruschetta was awesome and flavorful as well and the wine recommended by our server was perfect. The pizza looked awesome ill be sure to try next time, however if you're in the mood for pasta be sure to get the arrabiata sauce. It's packed with flavor and not too spicy!!",
        "This place is a lot of fun as a result of the atmosphere and pleasant wait staff!  The menu rocks a combination of vegetarian items, low carb items, and greasy guilty pleasures.\\n\\nThe only problem is that it may be difficult to locate parking during peak hours, especially when a sporting event is taking place.\\n\\nDoes anyone know how frequently Mr. Cooper makes appearances in his restaurant?  I'm just curious...",

He identified the problem and was able to fix it right away. I was in and out within ptetty quickly considering. Very professional and gave me the information I needed to make a decision on what services were needed. No pushing or pressure to get services. Thanks Jiffy Lube! I will definitely be back!",
        "I like Karen's Kreamery.  I made it a place to go when it was located in Surprise for the Gelato.  Inexpensive for great ice cream.  Great that they took up shop at the skate park, I assume they get more business at the new location.

They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right.",
        "I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker.",

Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",

My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!",
        "Super super slow. Expect a 15 minute wait in the drive through and about 50% if the time the food is cold or old.",
        "I was very disappointed in the food. Portions were quite small and monochromatic in tasty. We had to ask for bread. The dessert was very dry. All around skimpiness and not worth the money. There are many restaurants for tha same money around.",
        "When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!",
        "It is in a random location, way off the strip. \\n\\n+1 delish garlic fries\\n+1 really clean inside\\n+1 great prices\\n+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST\\n\\nI wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger.",
        "Worst service I have ever recieved. I go to this Starbucks a lot because it's on my way to work and everytime I regret it. The service is slow, even when I'm the only person in the drive thru. It take them forever to even greet me, and the coffee isn't that great either",
        "Great place, with a small, personal atmosphere. The service is amazing, and the beer choices are great. A lot of imported beer selection on tap. Good place for great conversation.",
        "i spent the better part of a slightly drizzly afternoon here last week.  so so pretty.  even with the cold and the rain. seeing lovely things like jewels and crowns and all the various nooks and crannies to be found was quite lovely.  the admission's a bit steep, but it's really a must-do in edinburgh. the views of the city are to die for and the history is fascinating.",
        "My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",
        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order \\\"venti iced stirred caramel macchiato\\\" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed \\\"not stirred\\\" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer",
        "i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it",
        "Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  \\n\\nMy neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.",
        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",
        "Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.",
        "I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!",
        "Love coming here food is always good no complaints here at all...And so awesome that all this worth the drive  thank you guys..",
        "I had fun here while I was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home. Great variety of dishes. One step up from the hometown buffet/golden corral type buffets.",
        "Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.",
        "From the first time we stepped into the place until the time we drove away, it was nothing but organized and friendly. \\n\\nEveryone was great. \\n\\nThe food was good, just watch for the precooked burgers in the \\\"juice\\\" if you have time ask for a fresh cooked one. prices were very reasonable.",
        "The terrible service here results in bad coffee. The coffee here always tastes bad. Worse than every other Starbucks I go to.  The staff doesn't listen to customers. I always ask for two pumps of cinnamon dolce in my iced coffee, but they always put the standard 6. I also asked for water once and the cashier just stood there doing nothing so I asked if I could get it now. She said no it will be waiting at the end. Laziness equals dissatisfied customers.",
        "The lady at the window was short & rude. 3/6 donuts were incorrect, she had already walked away & would not come back after handing me my 'latte' which was mostly foam. What a way to start your morning..",
        "Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)",
        "My husband and I stopped  at Sugar & Ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am.  The food and drink were a little pricey, but good.  I had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall.  It was relaxing, and a great way start off the morning.",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "Went on a thursday night with my boyfriend, it wasn't busy but took 10min. to be seated then ordered and it took a while for the waitress to return with just our drinks. Our food came nice and hot but then our waitress didn't return to ask if we needed something, service was bad and the food was just okay.We won't be returning to this location.",
        "A very tight parking lot for this Walgreens and I would seriously recommend that you monitor your surroundings when you're going from the store to your car. It is a very tight parking lot.\\n\\nI didn't go in on this particular visit - we used the drive-through and had a great clerk taking care of our prescription. Top notch and just for her, she gets a star. Otherwise it would have been a one star visit.",
        "this has been my place to go EVERY single time i am in vegas. the bartender (not sure if he is there anymore) is why i go there seriously, he is the best bartender i have come across in all my trips to vegas. when im craving that blue cheese burger and a good beer i go here. shout out to D! hope to see you soon!",
        "Went on a Thursday night.  It was alright.  Not crowded at all so we didn't stay long.  Came back later in the night and it was even more dead.\\n\\nLots of techno and dance.  But we did ask the DJ to play some Hip Hop and he squeezed two songs in.",
        "If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of.  And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass.  Wtf!?  This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus?  Will not be coming back.  Get it together .",
        "Fries where not good at all. Kind of mushy and weird seasoning. They charge for ranch. The burger was nothing to brag about. I had to ask for ketchup. Coupon made it worth a try- tricky parking lot to pull our of to make a left hand turn.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "A gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town.  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather, and cute cafe tables on the inside.  We had no wait even over the Xmas/New years holiday at prime lunch hour.\\n\\nExcellent service, very tasty lunch fare, and reasonable prices.\\n\\nI would definitely return here, and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well.",
        "At one of the Yelp events in Las Vegas earlier this month, Sin City Wings was on hand, giving out samples of their chicken wings and pot stickers.  While this was an uncommon duo, they worked very well together, especially with their sweet Bobby Q sauce (names after their own Chef Bobby).  I will say that the chicken wing tasted a little better than the pot sticker, but I would eat either of them again in a heartbeat.",
        "Meh... \\n\\nSuper slow going southbound in the morning. I've discovered I can get to work quicker on surface streets, which are no picnic.\\n\\nDecent ride when it's not rush hour.  Nice view through the mountains.",
        "We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice.",
        "The only thing this place loves is high prices. They clearly hate burgers. Food was greasy, cold and not worth even finishing. I hope this place closes sooner than later, there are way too many restaurants in Las Vegas that are overpriced and substandard that stay open because they rely on non repeat tourist business.",
        "The chicken tacos were the bomb!!  I havent had such good tex mex in a while and this is up there... the guac was great too...Because I went on a Sunday I also got to laugh at all the drunk tourist coming out of Rehab...boy oh boy...what a fun Sunday!",
        "I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!",
        "We went in again and this time on what I have to consider one of their busiest times, Sunday mid morning for brunch. The service was fast and flawless!\\n\\nWildflower and Louis you convinced me! 5 stars!",
        "Omg this was awesome! The only thing missing is tri tip. If they started smoking that, mmm... Mmm. They would have it made! Chelsea was our waitress. She was amazing. So funny and on top of her game! I would absolutely come here again and ask for her again!",
        "Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere",
        "I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\\n\\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?",
        "They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed, they don't have a great selection, the decor is predictable (although they do have a nice set of high tables) and the lighting is a bit weird. It is a good place to have a good conversation though - just be warned, it might leave you feeling blue too.",
        "I've only been here once and that was on a Thursday while a 90's rock cover band was playing. The band was way beyond fun (I honestly would have still enjoyed myself while sober) and being able to play beer pong added to the excitement.",
        "Really nice course with unbelievable homes all throughout the course! Driving range looked pretty fried but all in all was a good experience. Pro shop guys were very friendly and helpful and made my first experience a great one. Will definitely be going back. If you call to book a tee time I highly suggest you ask for James (nicest guy ever). Great price for locals! I got on for $59 at 12:30 in late November as a local. Great deal!",
        "I tried going here earlier today with my mom and sister and it turns out that it's closed!  We read the notice posted at the window that said that it was \\\"temporarily closed for remodeling\\\".  I sent a message to a moderator about the closure so hopefully it'll be updated soon.",
        "This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \\n\\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \\n\\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.",
        "This place is nice and clean. They have great people and it feels secure. That being said, the price is gross. Yes they have quality, but so do a lot of other places. This is by far the closest dispensary to me, but a half is 30-40 bucks more than some of my favorite spots. I can drive to the west valley and back and have spent less on gas and bud than I would on just bud at this place.",
        "Sensational and Orgasmic! Mark made me feel so relaxed with his magic hands. Ask for him ladies when you go in.",
        "I love Paradise Bakery.. I operate a small graphic design business and enjoy getting out of the office to work. Paradise Bakery is very accommodating.. they don't seem to mind when I spend a few hours there.. The staff has been awesome and the food is always excellent.",
        "Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast.",
        "I had a short wait on my visit to Dr. Harris and the staff was helpful in getting all my paperwork done. The Dr. was awesome, very personable and knowledgeable. They have a streamlined system and set me up the very next morning with bloodwork.\\n\\nI had my results available through their phone system 24 hours after that.\\n\\nNice, helpful staff, and good doctors is almost all you can ask for in a clinic.",
        "Go to brunch place in Montreal.  Don't know if it's worth the wait though.  Go during the week if you can when it's less busy.  We did and we ended up running into Georges St. Pierre!!  Eggs Benedict and GSP, what more can you ask for.",
        "Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \\\"afterparty\\\" but I would rather stick to the main clubs.",
        "Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks.",
        "Love this place! We drive 50 miles from Anthem just for the beer and food. Great selecton of craft beers and the nacaroni with brisket is to die for!",
        "I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review?!  I absolutely LOVE Gilbert Dogs!  The staff is great, the Facebook videos are AWESOME, and our dog Cayla always comes home happy and exhausted.  Love the fact that we can drop off or pick up at any time of day or night.  Love, love, love this place.  We drive 20+ minutes out of the way to take our dog here, and it's SO worth it!",
        "This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car. \\n\\nAttention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks.",
        "I went here in a Saturday afternoon and I have to say it was a mistake. \\n\\nThe beer was stale, soapy, and flat. The food was bad and our waitress was just slow. \\n\\nI have nothing positive to say about The Comedy Club.",
        "On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here.  SUPER friendly waiter named Brian.  Excellent service,  great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95.  Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a \\\"thatta boy\\\".  Not one negative.",
        "There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing.",
        "We are very pleased with our new patio security door. We now only wish we had done it sooner. The entire process was professional, including the installation.",
        "I stopped by Federico's for a quick bite to eat.  I ordered two beef tacos with a drink.  The woman at the counter was doing double duty at the drive-through so service was a bit slow, but the food was excellent.  The tacos were tasty, ,the lettuce was very crisp and fresh, and I was totally impressed by the food.  Very very good value for the money.",
        "probably the only place i come for dimsum. great prices and selections. they are always well staffed and you have dimsum carts always moving and restocking.\\n\\nthey have this coconut pastry bun. its the shiz, so good...\\n\\nmy favorite dimsum dish is the chicken feet.",
        "this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. \\n\\nThis gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "$7 for a 2oz container of guac with chips. Don't ask the rude bartender for a water refill he will tell you to get it yourself.  Guess he thinks there is no tip in getting a customer a refill on water when the servers are really busy.\\n\\nFood was good but don't be in a hurry.  There was not enough staff on duty to meet demand.",
        "Staff are very helpful and willing to assist you with anything you need. In fact, they'll notice if you're struggling with anything and will come over and ask you if you need any other help with things. A greeter is always at the door, cheerily saying hi to everyone walking in and offering help. Products are great and staff are knowledgable about which products are best for each person."

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \\\"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\\\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "If you are downtown, and craving Thai food this will do the trick. If you are looking for really good Thai food, this is not the place. It is a hip downtown restaurant, that is a bit over priced and lacks a warm place (In winter) to eat your food. It is really busy, and lacks the touches in the food and ambiance for the price of the food.  It's just  ok.",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "The driver, Daniel, was early to the pickup, so there was no pressure on the drive. He was courteous and helpful. I called other cabs to compare prices and they were by far the cheapest to the airport. Great value indeed!",
        "I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though.",
        "The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",

        "Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.",
        "Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!",
        "A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.",
        "This is pretty nice for the money. It's sort of hard to find as you walk down the street. It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.",
        "Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.",
        "Heard this was the #1 buffet in Vegas. The main draw of this place are its snow crab legs which were pretty good albeit skinny :P. The last time I was in vegas, The Bellagio had a similar buffet serving the same items for $35-$40 I believe(?) This place was $50.\\n\\n3.5 stars, but rounded up.",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Seems a little small and cramped.  Location is ok, prices cheap.  Salesmen have a weird vibe- you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service.",

        "This is definitely the place to go for tires. We checked everywhere to buy a specialty tire and these guy\\\"s had the best price. I found the tire on line cheaper and the met their price too! The service was great, the shop was clean and they were professional from start to finish, highly recommend discount tire",

        "We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra $2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day (2 Persons) $32.",
        "I go to Ari Sushi whenever I can. Good rolls, great price for the area (so close to scottsdale..) I just love pretty much everything about the atmosphere and feel of the place too. Nice for people who want a feel of a family sushi place. They actually place Japanese music too.",

I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",

        "At first glance, this place seems really affordable for great sushi in the Bellagio, but beware! The food portions are extremely small, nearly 1/3 the amount of what you would normally get at a regular sushi restaurant, resulting in having to pay 3x the cost! While the food was ok, the service was mediocre and prices sucked for the quantity you got.",
        "A nice Whole Foods, to be sure, but considering the Fry's right down the street has great produce at better prices I'm not really sure what would send me to Whole Foods aside from perhaps a search for something esoteric.  Not really much different from the Whole Foods back home in Ohio I'll still be here anytime I need bulk fleur de sel or perhaps quality coffee in a pinch, but otherwise I just can't justify the admission price.",
        "I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old.",
        "see the waitress?  see her ignore you?  see a bartender ?  good luck if you can find one...maybe they are hiding somewhere?  big points on the art and decor, the music is usually stellar, but the service is really lacking.  there is a really good selection of beer, somewhat pricey.  the hummus is really good.  oh but why is the Indian serving the naked goddess on the painting above the bar?  that will have you stumped for hours!",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "Nice experience. Good price. For me, an hour is too long and 30 is too short.  Go for the 45.",
        "Good food good prices! It just too small. It's almost like I dread going in because I know I'm going to have a hard time finding a seat and waiting for people to get up.",
        "Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.",
        "Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "It is in a random location, way off the strip. \\n\\n+1 delish garlic fries\\n+1 really clean inside\\n+1 great prices\\n+1 Bacon cheeseburger is THE BEST\\n\\nI wouldn't make a special drive for these burgers, but it definitely a great place for a good burger.",
        "Used a Localdines.com gift certificate to get our our meal for almost half off.  Food was very good, found the Hummus bruschetta a bit dry, Antipasto was excellent as was the Cheese selection.  Very good prices.  Ordered a glass of wine during meal and watched it sit on the bar for a good ten minutes.  Other than some small glitches, overall a great place.",
        "Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.",
        "Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money.",
        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus.",
        "Went to there truck at Ces had a huge line so I was excited, took 35 minuets to come out and they got my order wrong! They got me a new plate fast and I think they hooked me up with extra meet. Beef was okay nothing special shrimp was good not over cooked. Fried rice tasty but little undercooked. Wasn't to original but meat was done right. I would go back if there wasn't a wait.",
        "Tried with a Groupon. Suprised to be allowed to use multiple Groupons in one visit.  However, not allowed to purchase any specials with the Groupons (e.g half price chicken fingers).  Food tasted good, however nothing amazing here.  Really liked the fries.  Burgers were somewhat greasy.  Good location inside Miracle Mile shops.  I probably would not eat here regularly due to higher prices for burger and fries than Im used to (approx. $16 with tax).",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "Good food, fries are awesome but everything is so pricey.",
        "I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat",
        "Queen Creek Olive Mill has delicious sandwiches, gelato, and of course, olive and balsamic vinegar products. I wouldn't come here for breakfast because it's pretty standard fare, but the sandwiches are great. It's a little bit pricey, but it's a nice experience.",
        "I went to this place around 11:35am and the door sign say open 11:30am I tried to open the door and it's still locked but workers are already inside just looking at me i waited for them to open the door but did not. One star!",
        "This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.",
        "Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.",
        "This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!",
        "Very typical Vegas--I got a deal on Hotels.com for $119 for 1 night in one of the \\\"Motor\\\" buildings. It was a little trashy (some peeling paint and a worn out comforter), but it was totally what I expected. When booking a room, definitely find a deal and don't pay full price! Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",
        "FYI, the prices listed on the menu linked to this profile are lower than what is on the menu at the restaurant. The burgers average about .50 and higher. The hickory loaded for example is really 9.79. Otherwise great food.",
        "From the first time we stepped into the place until the time we drove away, it was nothing but organized and friendly. \\n\\nEveryone was great. \\n\\nThe food was good, just watch for the precooked burgers in the \\\"juice\\\" if you have time ask for a fresh cooked one. prices were very reasonable.",
        "I eat vegetarian about 95% of the time, but when I feel like eating some flesh I have the turkey sandwich from Blackstrap. Super delicious and soooo flavorful. The braised greens and fried macaroni and cheese balls are really good, too! I know it's a BBQ place, and their whole concept is meat, BUT I would really, really, really love if they threw in a couple main vegetarian options.",
        "A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things.",
        "This was our first time trying Mickey's Tavern. I had the Eggplant Panino and the boyfriend had the Mickey burger. We upgraded to try the sexy fries and super sexy fries. We were both wildly impressed by everything. High quality meal for awesome prices and a fun chill vibe on a Monday evening. I guess some guys get together every Monday to jam- we left before they started but it was a very friendly environment.",
        "Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)",
        "losing a star.  Since they've gone to 24/7 hours, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  They turn so many tables I don't think they care about service anymore.  Still the best spot for viet food in LV but viet food shouldn't be too expensive, it's comfort food from a 3rd world country!",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "I wish I'd read the Yelp reviews prior to stopping in to Pepe's. The super burrito was anything but \\\"super\\\". The carne asada was more like tiny minced meat and the size of the burrito should've been listed as puny, especially for the price.\\n\\nThe wife's breakfast burrito was no better and she could barely eat it. Never, never, never again.",
        "My husband and I stopped  at Sugar & Ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am.  The food and drink were a little pricey, but good.  I had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall.  It was relaxing, and a great way start off the morning.",
        "Overpriced just \\\"okay\\\" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint.",
        "Pretty cool place... considering it's just a self-serve yogurt shop.   The price was average (I think 39 cents an ounce).\\n\\nThe pluses were they had a lot of different toppings.  My wife especially liked the chocolate rocks.  And they had some unique flavors which I haven't seen at other yogurt shops.",
        "Went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot. I had the Lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food. But good prices and decent food.",
        "Do NOT go here. The doctors are good enough but the wait time to get in the room is at least 30 minutes each time. Check in: 10:35, appt time: 10:45, time now 11:27. KMN! \\n\\nUpdate: they called and said I couldn't be seen there because I had missed 1 appointment in 2009 and 2010 and and 2013. How rude is that? No customer relations at all.",
        "A convenient location for me right of the 101, and quick service.  The prices seem reasonable but the few times I have been there I have noticed that there is typically some unfinished details on the wash.  Namely the glass does not come out too well.  \\n\\nThey are friendly about fixing it up and correcting anything unfinished.  I will probably keep using them and update the stars should their service become a little tighter on the details.",
        "This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out.",
        "Went to dinner with my girlfriend the other night and had a fabulous dinner here. The ambiance is lovely and the Mediterranean cuise was varied and delicious. I was also pleased to see when the bill didn't break the bank. I highly recommend this cute little restaurant for a pleasureable dining experience at a great price.",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price",
        "No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever.",
        "Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",
        "Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \\nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.",
        "This place is the real deal.  The pho here has really deep developed flavors.  Good sized portions & good prices.",
        "Good value. It's an older property but decent place and price was right at 180/night during peak season. Great atmosphere on the patio to enjoy a drink or meal. Beds were actually pretty good for an older place, they are definitely newer. Convenient location right off the freeway and tucked into the side of the mountain. Didn't get out for golf but played there before and remember it being good bit great. It's not Scottsdale but it's a great value.",
        "I saw the show in Sacramento, CA and overall I liked it. All jokes, tricks was understandable as I am from Europe. I felt as I was back to my childhood . Animals and performers were good. My 8 year old son enjoyed the show. The only pros that I have that the price was too expensive for the location it was used for the show : old movie theatre that was a cheap , poor place not in a nice neighborhood .",
        "I love Lynrd Skynyrd.  This corporate piece of whatever ruins their name by giving you an overpriced buffet with a picture of the band hanging overhead.  There is no entertainment or schedule to be found.  When I asked if they are going to have a band, they stated that maybe they would have a band on the weekends.  You need to drop the price, add memorabilia, and have bands playing regularly.  Walk in and walk right out, after you see it.",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "Service Fry's & Fry's Marketplace FAIR enough.Price............HONEST so. Best for weekly  shopping like me...little but every Friday it got festive look.",
        "Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to.",
        "The best Buffet on the strip, pricey but you pay for what you get and the food is top shelf, chefs are top shelf, waite staff outstanding.  You expect the best from this place this was a very enjoyable experience.",
        "A gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town.  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather, and cute cafe tables on the inside.  We had no wait even over the Xmas/New years holiday at prime lunch hour.\\n\\nExcellent service, very tasty lunch fare, and reasonable prices.\\n\\nI would definitely return here, and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well.",
        "Great for walking around in, The Prices are expensive for everything from Alcohol to Gelato to Watches and Various items. But it is the Forum shops and makes for a great time none the less to get out of the Hot Vegas Sun and look at things you may never afford or would want if you could afford it. Lots of good restaurants inside as well. Which range from reasonable to Take out a Second Mortgage on the house.",
        "Price - reasonable range\\nService - prompt and friendly \\nAtmosphere - parking kind of hard but has a nice outdoor area . Overall neat and hip\\nFood - flavorful :) pretty decent overall.",
        "This course is as advertised. Great Fairways, Great Greens, and views are awesome.  My only gripe is there is no grass range. For the price they charge, there should at least be a full sized range. not a small one.",
        "This buffet has gone downhill. The overall prices without discounts are 21.99, which is not worth your money because the food is less than ok. The fish tastes like its been frozen for months and the pastas are watery or too dry... the Chinese and Mexican food were ok and the American food was worse than mediocre. The desserts were good, especially the gelato. Overall, don't come here to eat unless you are dying of starvation!",
        "I had the $19 prix fixe lunch today (5/14/10).  It was excellent!  I started with the onion tart and salad.  Main course was the couscous.  For dessert, I had the George V, a dark chocolate pastry filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, topped with peanuts and over a black sacher biscuit.  It was delightful.  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with this lunch.  I really liked the small restaurant.",

        "We have eaten here many times, always for supper, and have never been disappointed wiith either the food or the service.  It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  The food is very flavorfull.  We especially enjoy the roasted chicken (frareg), the kafta and the shawarma.  The pita bread is especially good, arriving right out of the oven; it's puffed up and hot - the best such bread that we have ever eaten.  Prices are reasonable.",
        "Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "I have never, ever not enjoyed myself at Petra's! Its grown up & sexy, 21 & up, the atmosphere & ambiance are on point and its generally just the perfect place for a night out! Great date night place for an intimate experience, especially for LGBT, but I think anyone could enjoy themselves here!",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Try the paloma! From the people who brought you Bramble, there is a new kid in town. Lovely little place on Queen street where they choose your cocktails for you based around what you like drinking.\\nWe all loved our drinks and the service was great",
        "One of my favorite places to eat!! I come here maybe once every other week. I would go more often if it was closer to my house. Their ingredients are organic and always fresh!! It used to be more consistent but I feel as though they have been slacking lately, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.",
        "A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",
        "Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.",
        "If that Beach burger wasnt SOOO GOOD!!\\n\\nCustomer service is out the window when it comes to this place. \\n\\nSometimes bad enough to where I'd just rather go to the million other places that serve burgers just as good or better with even better customer service.",
        "My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!",
        "This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.",
        "I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \\\"smokers\\\" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.",

        "This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love.",
        "Where's the sixth star? Incredible meal, service, everything.\\n\\nHad the beef Wellington with fingerling potatoes. Wellington cut like butter and was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nStaff was very attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nWe had upstairs booth seating, and at first thought it would not be as nice as downstairs where we could see the kitchen, but the booth was perfect.",
        "A lot of people love the Mirage... I'm not a big fan. \\n\\nI like it there. It's okay. It's in a decent location, it has some good restaurants, some bars and other things, it just doesn't tickle my fancy much. Maybe it's the middle-aged vibe? It feels older. The crowd is older and everything seems a little worn out.",
        "El Chorro is one of the best patio dining experiences in the Valley during the \\\"good weather\\\" months.  The food is good and the ambiance great.  That pretty much sums it up for me.  The service is usually very good.  If you are looking for great outdoor ambiance on a perfect Arizona evening then this is the place.  Plus, where else can you chat up Alice Cooper while waiting in line for the hostess?",

Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",

        "Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",

Horrible service and long wait times, cold food",

I believe they have a new one thats more spicy than the Mayan, a white chocolate, and a plain chocolate. A must have if your over that way :)",
        "Went here because they had a sign that there was a brunch, turns out it's only Saturday and Sunday. The food was cafeteria like for $18 each. Good service from our waiter. You're killing me LVH with your restaurants, Benihanas was the only awesome restaurant. We are going elsewhere right now for dinner.",

Portions were large. \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait.",

        "This place is sensational. Went her about 7-8 times in our 10 day stay in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills. Just couldn't get enough. Food and variety of is great, terrific decor and friendly service. A restaurant that really has it all together. Red Sangria best I've ever had.",
        "Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience.

        "This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",
        "Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.",
        "Good food. They sell kids meal that is just right for me. It includes a slider (which is pretty much a full sized burger) , French fries (fresh and generous portion) and drink, for like 6 bucks. This is my favorite airport food actually. The bar next to it is a good place to hangout for a beer when waiting for your next flight.",

        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.",
        "We couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the delicious food!! Loved everything about this place. Great way to end a day of strolling around old town Scottsdale. Perfect date spot!!",
        "Best LFS in Town!!! Very friendly  staffs... James & Jorell are very helpful!! Whatever fish you would like to find... They will try their hardest to find you the rare/special fish.... Case in point.. They got me a Black Tang.  I have been looking for so long... Thanks guys!!!",
        "This is one of the few traditional Japanese places in Phx.  It ranks as good as Roka Akor,but cheaper and more casual.  The decor is is nice and simple-- very traditional.  The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",
        "i spent the better part of a slightly drizzly afternoon here last week.  so so pretty.  even with the cold and the rain. seeing lovely things like jewels and crowns and all the various nooks and crannies to be found was quite lovely.  the admission's a bit steep, but it's really a must-do in edinburgh. the views of the city are to die for and the history is fascinating.",
        "Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore ...",
        "I love this place.. great friendly, professional and effective service... I came here years ago after my car accident. Now I come with my girl 2 x a week.. Chong is my favorite doc.. They always have plenty of candy... And they are keeping the SHASHI in there somewhere...",
        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli. It's easy to access and the food was fresh and well prepared. Love it! Everyone working was all smiles as well. Exactly what you expect from Vegas! Nicely done Circus Circus.",
        "They ignored our attempts to order and would not acknowledge us at the window when we tried to see if anyone was even there. So rude and the food is cold.",
        "I had the free range chicken, which was ok.  Although it was very tender, I thought there was going to be more flavor.  The bar cheese bread was good.  The mussles were delicious.  The cheesecake was probably my favorite here.",
        "The owner is amazing. He's obviously very talented with nails. Very laid back and nice. I love the decor. I love the fact they serve beer here! Nails came out perfect, and were a good price. I like how when I screwed up my whole hand of nails he didn't make a big deal about it and redid them without complaint. I will be back, now a loyal customer!",
        "I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!",
        "i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it",
        "I like this place and agree with everyone else...\\n\\nThe crawfish was yum.  The seasoning was perfect with the perfect amount of spice.  Thank you for the gradual scale of spicyness.\\n\\nCan I get some wet wipes or something though?\\n\\nService is kind of slow.  It was busy but you would think they would compensate with more than one or two servers on a Friday night.",
        "This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.  Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.  Always fast service too.",
        "I love thai food and eat it whenever I can. This is the first place in the whole valley I have found that serves my favorite dish evil jungle princess. It is so tasty and they do it very well. They are always busy and servers are always working hard. My fiance has had a few different dishes and is always happy with his picks as well.",
        "Great airport bar that is quick and easy...and good  Def recommend if your waiting for a plane outta charlotte!",
        "overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. \\nemployee came and reprimanded her.",
        "HATE  Nothing.\\n\\nDISLIKE  Nothing.\\n\\nLIKE  The spinach curry. The chicken cutlet. The sides offered. The pleasant service. The close proximity to other local favorite spots.\\n\\nLOVE  Nothing.",
        "My favorite food truck I've tried in the city! The hot dogs are unique, the people working are nice, and you definitely get enough food for $6. Try the Igby!",
        "Hard to beat a pretty decent meal for 2 adults and 2 kids for under $20\\nGood subs, kids friendly and good location.\\nGood option for sunday's lunch!",
        "Great little Australian themed cafe on St.Laurent, the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat. They bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home. Most importantly the few times I've been in the coffee has not disappointed,  well made espresso and lattes",
        "Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  \\nThe Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.",
        "I went back for more... stir fry and bahn mi this time. Both were excellent... great proportions making it an excellent value. Awesome flavor. The people running this place are extremely nice. The bahn mi was even better than the one I get it Da Vangs, which is saying a lot since that place is still my #1 favorite for spring rolls and pho.",
        "I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills",
        "Love Butters! Perfect pancakes, tasty turkey bacon, gourmet grits, creamy caramel macchiato,  fresh squeezed orange juice, and quick, efficient service! Nummmy!",
        "This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!",
        "Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\\n\\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita.",
        "Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!",
        "Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Sushi was awesome.  We had the Philly, Naruto, Rainbow, Spicy Tuna rolls.  The seviche was fantastic.  Drinks are well priced and the variety is great.  I will go back often, one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.  You can't go wrong with Tamari.",
        "The lady at the window was short & rude. 3/6 donuts were incorrect, she had already walked away & would not come back after handing me my 'latte' which was mostly foam. What a way to start your morning..",
        "CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal.",
        "As far as gas stations go, this is one of my favorites do to location, prices and food. Yes.... Food.... Well gas station food that is, LOL. Prices are fair and they have a decent hot selection of all the gas station goodies you can imagine. Hot dogs, taquitos, sandwiches with mystery meat etc....",
        "We had awesome bottle service for the three yr anniversary party for perfecto! Our waitress was attentive, security was amazing, and the host was really nice and helpful. The club was incredible! Oakenfold only played and hr and a half..the shortest I ever I have ever heard him play. He was good though. Huge dance floor, cool lights and screens, side dancers and acrobats. lots to watch!",
        "I love going here, I have only been for breakfast.  Sitting on the patio is very nice, service is great considering how busy they are.  The french toast is amazing, one order can easily be split between two people.  Sunday's seem to be busy but I have not had to wait more than 15 min. and they don't rush you when you are seated.",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "With so many decent taquerias in Chandler, differentiating isn't easy. But Senor Taco sets itself apart with tortilla-shell bowls (like a taco salad) and salsa bar that includes roasted peppers.",
        "Went to dinner with my girlfriend the other night and had a fabulous dinner here. The ambiance is lovely and the Mediterranean cuise was varied and delicious. I was also pleased to see when the bill didn't break the bank. I highly recommend this cute little restaurant for a pleasureable dining experience at a great price.",
        "I have used three different cleaning services for my home in Las Vegas and while all have done an excellent job of cleaning, not all have done so at a reasonable price.\\n\\nLittle Lamb Cleaning works extremely well, very fast and at the right price.  Brenda communicates well throughout the entire process and payment was easy to take care of.\\n\\nThey're now my \\\"go to\\\" cleaners in Las Vegas!  Outstanding work.  Highly recommended.",
        "Food is okay. (Womens) Bathrooms are nasty, my friend had a mouse crawl over his feet (Sunday 6/23/2013) And when staff was informed, they said it had run into the kitchen and someone stepped on it. Oh okay.. Problem solved? Never been particularly impressed with service either, but that doesn't bother me much.",
        "This outlet mall has improved dramatically since the last time I was there a year ago.  The range of stores is outstanding and it has the higher end stores.  The Cole Haan and Joe's Jeans stores are great here.  The sushi buffet at this mall is also outstanding.  The Polo store could run a few more sales.  It is my least favorite of the Polo outlets.  I prefer the one in Austin, TX, and in Phoenix, AZ.",
        "Love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries, melons, and my very favorite red beans. Always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small. Guaranteed! :)",
        "Beau caf\\u00e9 bien am\\u00e9nag\\u00e9. Bons produits. Cependant il est souvent bond\\u00e9. De plus leur wifi fonctionne tr\\u00e8s mal depuis longtemps et malgr\\u00e9 les plaintes il font rien pour rem\\u00e9dier \\u00e0 la situation.",
        "Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!",
        "Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!",
        "Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!",
        "Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!",
        "A gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town.  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather, and cute cafe tables on the inside.  We had no wait even over the Xmas/New years holiday at prime lunch hour.\\n\\nExcellent service, very tasty lunch fare, and reasonable prices.\\n\\nI would definitely return here, and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well."

        "Industrial chic, great people, almost like having dinner at a friends house, only better. Great food! Amazing really. They use local and fresh ingredients. The menu is always changing.  The wine list is nice, and the craft cocktails have won me over... Especially that good \\\"Bourbon Lemonade.\\\" oh and the brunch is so good! The croque madam with a mango bloody Mary changed my life.",
        "One of the more crowded and more popular places on Mill, but sometimes it will take 10-15 min to get a drink. Fun place to play some pool and have a few drinks. The long islands are strong and will make your knees loose after a few. Overall not too bad of a place but just short of 4 stars.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",
        "Super expensive, but a beautiful setting..I have only been to camelback inn to \\\"spa\\\" and thought I would try some place new.  Had a great expresso mud wrap and massage with Damian from Poland.  As a mother of 4, I was not cool with hearing kids scream at the pool DURING MY service.  And the maintainence man on his walky-talky outside my room wasn't very nice either.",
        "calling it the best ball park in America is a total understatement, its the greatest ever. not a bad seat there. Pittsburgh has been very lucky, we hit home runs with PNC & Console but of course Heinz Field is a turkey. As Meat Loaf would say 2 out of 3 ain't bad!!!!",
        "Why always such a long wait... ??? And if waiting is forever long, why install those most uncomfortable park bench... Staffs are awful & unhelpful & slow... Really ?",
        "Well priced in this day and age (no pints over \\u00a32.90), possibly due to the large student population in the surrounding area. Good number of large tvs showing all the major sporting events (& such modern highlights as Cage Rage ), pleasant staff and a generally lively atmosphere make for a goos place to sink a few pints.\\n\\n\\n Food on offer too but personally yet to sample it.",
        "Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. \\n\\nThe pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. \\n\\nThe one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.",
        "Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion.",
        "If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and \\\"Mexican food\\\" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.\\n\\nI also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.",
        "I will echo the comments of everyone else. This was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park, although it technically is a fountain. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area it's worth the stop.",
        "This place is sensational. Went her about 7-8 times in our 10 day stay in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills. Just couldn't get enough. Food and variety of is great, terrific decor and friendly service. A restaurant that really has it all together. Red Sangria best I've ever had.",
        "Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.",
        "They ignored our attempts to order and would not acknowledge us at the window when we tried to see if anyone was even there. So rude and the food is cold.",
        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",
        "Tradional american food, the service was good Our waiter was very friendly, the food came out pretty quick.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, I had the strawberry basil mojito very good.  Sometimes they have live music there , theres a nice outside area to eat where you can enjoy the fountain.  Theres a gift shop in the front of the restaurant where you can shop all the hard rock mercandise.",
        "I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.

This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.",
        "I thought the sushi was ok. Some of my fish was a little less buttery and tender like I would have preferred. The rolls were ok but the tempura they leave under a heat lamp so it doesn't taste as fresh as it could be. \\n\\nI don't know if I would choose this sushi place over the several options around. But for a cheap and convenient all you can eat place it's a decent choice.",
        "Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back",
        "Terrible service. Server acted like infant when asked if he could ask the kitchen for alternative dish. Do not ask the chef to deviate from menu. Will cause server to have meltdown. Never been to so called fine italian where you could not change pasta. Manager not much better. Server had no idea about wine list. Complete idiot. Would not recommend when visiting pittsburgh.",
        "Super rip off. Took the car in for an oil change. They recommended $2000+ of \\\"repairs\\\". I left and took it to a mechanic who I trust. All it needed was $230 for brake pads (Firestone wanted $450 for that). Stay away from this place unless you have money you don't want.",

        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "Verdict: Good before, but \\\"meh\\\" now. \\n\\nThis place was pretty good and always gave us exactly what we ordered, but now they give us half the portions of what we used to get. \\n\\nI don't know if maybe they recently changed owners, but we won't be coming back here anymore.",

        "Our room was clean, the bedding was pretty, no bed bugs, and the front desk okay.  And the shuttle to Bill's on the strip was a short ride and the wait wasn't very long. \\nThe casino smelled like an ashtray.  Our room smelled like urine until after we ran the air/heat.  The bathroom DID have a tub, but the room was small and the shower was dark.",
        "Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \\n\\nNo happy hour menu. \\n\\n\\\"Communal bar table\\\" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\\n\\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return.",
        "Dude something has happened to this place in recent months, the quality is not what it used to be, the service is not what it used to.  I don't know if they had a change in management or what cause me and my wife used to go here ALL the time for the All You Can Drink Saki and Beer and All You Can Eat.  We don't go here anymore cause the qualify just went and crapped out on us.  Go to Sushi Bomb down the street",
        "Everything but the Kal-bi was delicious, but then again it is a tofu house.  It would give any garden grove area tofu restaurants a run for their money.  Kal-bi was good, just needed to be seasoned more.  Bim bim bop was very good; fresh ingredients.  Banchan was fresh and tasty also.  Great Korean place in Vegas!",
        "I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now.",

The menu has been revamped with quality made from scratch food, the staff seems to know what they're doing as I haven't had a long wait for anything. I can say that Sleepy Dog has changed my opinion about their brewbub, changing my review to 4 stars. I highly recommend a pint of Red Rover!",
        "I went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the Wellington.  It now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way.  Just thought it was funny after my initial review.  Still very good though!",
        "Waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Go to Target on Blue Diamond, much more helpful!",
        "Don't count on a roll-away for your family. They have a self imposed policy of 2 beds to a room and will not change no matter the circumstances, expectations, or that they advertise roll-aways available.",
        "First arrived and the family a little bored. The staff was nice but the displays need to improve. Great building. Luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day. We had a great time with the simulation crew. End if day it all worked out great and family happy.",
        "Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  \\nA few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!.",
        "I had my daughters baby shower here. Let me tell you I was a pain with all my changes. The banquet manager, Nova was very helpful and patient. At the event the room was beautiful, service great and the food was really good. I did not have one complaint!",
        "Great place to hang out for a few beers and some pool, darts or fooseball. Jake is an awesome bartender making the experience even better. It's great for bigger groups and the owner came around to say hi too, very nice guy. Didn't try the food but the Goose Island IPA is great.",
        "Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel.",
        "Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.",
        "I had a good stay. Loved the pool, Sayers club and Bazaar! Check in was a pain in the ass but with that aside it was good.",
        "After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.",
        "Good service shop for basic things like a smog or quick oil change.. Prices decent, about $16 for a smog and $28 for an oil change.",
        "SCAM!  They put synthetic oil in my car when it doesn't need it (confirmed with the dealer) and charged me over $70 for the oil change.\\n\\nAVOID THIS PLACE for their unethical business practices.",

        "Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch.",
        "Went to the Ranch for the first time and it was'nt baseball lol, I attended the \\\"Rumble at the Ranch\\\" MMA fights that Trilogy MMA had out there on the 23rd.

        "I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point.",
        "Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place.",
        "--Service was slow...no refills, never checked back, had to wait for check.\\n\\n--pizza was pretty good. Crispy toppings.\\n\\n--Parking was not too bad. Park around the corner.\\n\\n--Too bad for the awful service here! Maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers.",
        "Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever. Mon Ami Gabi=not such a good night. How do you say hell night in French? Enfer nuit? \\n\\nI think a name change is in order. Oh, and your staff is very French too. In attitude.",
        "No hot water. Called the front desk and was told to let the water run half an hour first. I let it run an hour on both days and still no hot water. Coffee machine in toom didn't work correctly and one of the lights didn't have a bulb. Did have a mini fridge amd air conditioning which was nice but without hot water, can't take a nice shower. Would not stay again.",
        "Worst experience ever! Why does a hookah bar open at noon but won't serve hookah until 4 pm? Four employees here chatting and on their phones neglecting to help or even acknowledge other patrons. It's the end of December and their heaters outside don't work? Have been here for 45 minutes and not checked on once by any employee at all. Worst customer service experience in all of Vegas.",

SHC Crossfit is not only less expensive it also has far better coaching than my 1st box!  Come check out SHC Crossfit... you won't be disappointed.",
        "Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back.",
        "Went here last night for the first time last night... Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)",
        "Conveniently located at the entrance of the Mirage, its a great location for grabbing a quick beer.   My only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucks...yikes!",
        "I am really disappointed overall-overpriced for portion of chips which looked like soggy potatoes (not very clean either-they should change the fryers more often). I have been ask to pay extra for mayo?! Really????",
        "I've been before and the food is okay. Today however I'm reviewing the service. After seating at the bar patiently waiting for service I decided to leave after the bartender did not acknowledge my presence and went on to serve guest that arrived after me. The host at the door were no better and very unpleasant.",
        "Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.",
        "Great sandwiches.  My kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options.",
        "Yay! Sephora is finally here!! This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney. I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. I may actually start shopping here again.",
        "This Hotel is Great!!!   The employees that work here are all wonderful and friendly. The reason for the 1 star is for the RESORT FEE that has now gone up to $28 a night.\\nI go to Las Vegas to gamble... I never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers. (Spa, Gym, Pool, Wi-Fi , etc).  So, why am I being forced to pay for something I don't use???",
        "Worst indian food. Total waste of money. Lunch buffet is $12 with only small selection of food. Chicken is the worst I ever had. Sweet dish ( gulab jamun) very strange taste. I came with group of people, and was embarrassed to be the host. I am going back there unless they change the cook and increase selection.",
        "For the Pool....$140 for Cabana which wasn't bad....service was horrible, they honestly had 3-4 girls for the entire pool, to include Cabana patrons.  Music was good overall, not a bad way to spend an afternoon....",
        "I like Karen's Kreamery.  I made it a place to go when it was located in Surprise for the Gelato.  Inexpensive for great ice cream.  Great that they took up shop at the skate park, I assume they get more business at the new location. Guess I'm going to have to learn to skateboard to have an excuse to visit the park for ice cream.:)",
        "Got here at 645 to be first for an oil change took 40 min to get car on rack. 15 minutes in the air to get the oil drained. Watched 3 employees talk about nothing before that even started. No one in lobby to great you and the customer waiting area has garbage in it from Thursday when I dropped in to try and get the oil changed then",
        "First time here. In and out within 30 minutes. I usually HATE going to my oil changed because they try to get you to buy everything- esp when they see a young girl and let's face it I don't know anything about cars- the man was very nice and even took my word - no means no. Painless. Thanks!",
        "I came here last night with a bunch of my bf's colleagues.  They had the outside area reserved and there were bottles of tequila at the tables.  Yeah....drink all day by the pool, followed  by drinks a party at Mandalay and then add tequila.\\n\\nSorry Liver!",

It seemed gross and chewy.\\n\\nNo flavor after adding 10 ladles of sauces.  It was a miracle we survived, since we only went based on our GPS and not reviews.\\n\\nLesson learned......read Yelp!",

        "FYI: Google/Yelp renders the location incorrectly, it's actually about a mile south of where it appears making this a difficult location to check-in at. It's in the shopping center just south of the 202 next to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. Bing maps this address correctly, Google will if you change the Address to Gilbert 85236.",
        "The fries are the best.  This place just isn't as clean as it used to be, starting to look like a Chinese buffet. They have changed managers a lot since they opened.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "This hotel is on the strip, walking distance to everything, but calm and quiet. The rooms are gorgeous. (amazing bath tub with rose petals left on your towel) The bar has an amazing view and delicious cocktails! I can't wait to stay here again and enjoy some pool time!",
        "Went for lunch today for the first time. HMMMM expected a little more than we got. The service was great, but the food-so-so. Both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry. I asked for extra mayo but it never came. And COKE in a can for $2.50....come on, with those prices get a fountain. I probably won't be back.",
        "This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops.",
        "This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.\\n\\nThere are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill.",
        "As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste."

I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price.",
        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\\n\\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Good food, chill indoor/outdoor vibe, dog-friendly (outdoors unless you have a service dog). You order at the counter and then they give you a number and bring it to your table. Very casual and cool. Tucked in amongst shade trees, little running water sculptures around and away from the street provides an oasis-like quality. Simple menu, but fresh, quality food and a friendly and efficient staff. Easy parking. This place keeps drawing me back for Cave Creek chilling.",
        "I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!",
        "Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \\\"cooked\\\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions.",
        "Not so great the only thing good i had was the drinks. Jerk chicken -dry, coconut shrimp was ok- sauce was nasty, and the dip for the chips were nasty..... Will I return hell- no\\nEVERYTHING left on the table not really touch but empty drink glasses",
        "I have fallen in love with the oxtail soup here but got there on this trip before 11:00 pm and had to settle for the steak and shrimp special.  Steak was tougher than a boot and while it was only $8.00 it was as they say, \\\"tougher than a 2 dollar steak\\\".  Salad bar is pretty decent but if come here for anything other than the oxtail soup you are wasting your time as you can do better elsewhere.",
        "This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "One of those places you just go when you are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian because it's so convenient, has that menu item that every person in your party wants whether it be fake pho noodle soup or a burger, and you can crawl into the restaurant at 1:00am to satisfy your drunk hunger.... \\n\\nThe bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal.\\nThe service is really slow....",
        "Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.",
        "This place is pretty lively when we went. The atmosphere gave me a Dallas's vibe. The food was good. I had a chicken cesar salad. My friend got some shrimp pasta dish, that was pretty good. Must try their brownie. It's freshly made with your choice of ice cream on top. It's very good, but only when it is hot. When it gets cold, it won't taste as good. So eat it fast.",
        "The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.",
        "This was a decent buffet ....just like many in Vegas. I enjoyed the made to order mac and cheese. The mac and cheese guy was friendly and created a great mac and cheese dish for me. They had choices from shrimp, beef, bacon, onions, chives, three different cheeses, a couple of others that I cannot remember but you will have an opportunity to be creative. Overall, it was an okay choice.",
        "Went to there truck at Ces had a huge line so I was excited, took 35 minuets to come out and they got my order wrong! They got me a new plate fast and I think they hooked me up with extra meet. Beef was okay nothing special shrimp was good not over cooked. Fried rice tasty but little undercooked. Wasn't to original but meat was done right. I would go back if there wasn't a wait.",

        "One of the better dim sum places in Arizona! You've got all your essentials here: shrimp dumplings, shu mai, BBQ buns, shrimp long noodles, sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves, etc. All of it is pretty delicious and gives me a taste of home in LA. :)\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my go to dim sum places and worth the drive!",
        "Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.",
        "Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.",
        "considering it has Emeril's name on it, i expected way better. sure, the lobster bisque was good, but my steak was extremely, EXTREMELY tough, and although i hate spicy food, my boss said his etouffee had \\\"no heat\\\" for cajan-inspired dish. the service was definitely lacking both in friendliness and speed. come on, you guys can do way better...but next time, Wolfgang Puck.",
        "Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \\n\\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.",
        "How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40.",
        "This is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter and food is brought to your table.  My wife ordered the chicken skewer plate and I ordered the lamb skewer.  Each came with vegetable cous cous, a small salad, hummus and pita bread.  The food was on the bland side with the meat overdone and dry. I saved a few dollars by using a coupon I found in the Zip Code Magazine.    \\n(",
        "I had the falafel wrap and kufta kebab entree. Great flavors, although the wrap was a little too heavy on the tahini. The rice that accompanies the entrees was superb and a perfect compliment to the kebab. \\n\\nDefinitely heading here again to try more. :)",
        "Overpriced just \\\"okay\\\" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint.",
        "I don't typically like Asian cuisine but When I came here I had the shrimp pho, It was so delicious! If you like spicy and seafood, this is your dish. And service here is friendly and I love the decor, it's so cute.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",

It was good, but I really would have preferred some shrimp. The seating wasn't that comfortable. It was just Ok. I would go back for lunch, but not for dinner.",
        "Ordered the Siete Mares and it is out of sight!  If I were ordering this anywhere in Scottsdale it would have cost triple what they charge.  5 blue mussels, 5 clams, several large shrimp.  Spicy, served on a bed of angel hair pasta with Texas toast to die for.  Oh, and did I mention their  beer menu is awesome...",
        "Stopped in here just for the 5.00 Nathans hot dog, draw and chips. They have a condiment bar with about 30 toppings for the dogs. \\n\\nThe place itself it fairly nice, kind of a old school pub feel (lots of carved wood and nice couch/lounge areas.",
        "The music is a little too loud, but their food is so good. Their burger with the lobster and asparagus is my favorite meal on the menu. Love it!",
        "The sushi was excellent, and the fish was very, very fresh, with wonderful texture and taste.  I graded Sushi Twister down a star because the rice kept falling apart (in both nigiri and rolls), and the Yellow Mango wiz Shrimp roll did not have much flavor.  Everything else was outstanding in taste, particularly the Vacation Roll.  \\n\\nIt's a new favorite sushi spot for us, and we won't hesitate to return.",
        "I miss this place.  Lots of live plants inside, and food that brought me right back home.",
        "The reason for 2 stars.  Order accuracy!  My food has been wrong the last 3 times!  I ordered 3 quesa tacos for my lady and me.  We ordered 2 shrimp and 1 carnitas.  We got  2 beef and 1 carnitas.  The server said the ticket was correct.  This is the third time this happened!  Don't get me wrong, the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time.",
        "The room or pretty decent, but their WiFi policy is INSANE.  $25/day PER device.  I sucked it up and paid for my work laptop, and then determined it was $25 more for my iPad and $25 more for iPhone.  Absolutely ridiculous.",
        "Seriously one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Ordered the Wellington, chorizo stuffed lobster tail, onion soup, green salad & rib eye. All absolutely amazing! Service was awesome place was cool worth every penny. If you are havin hard time thinking prices are high it's def worth it. Will go back my next Vegas trip!",
        "super bomb!!\\nfeels like the one in cali!\\nreally love the shrimp + whole shebang flavor!!",
        "Ok sports bar, good happy Hour values.  Wings and the usual sports bar food.  Food quality is good but salad and vegetarian choices are limited, but available.  Beer by the pitcher.  Some customers get to loud and use loud foul language which the staff seems to tolerate so be aware if you take the kids.",
        "Great tasting pizza. We ordered tomato, garlic, basil and cheese. Thin New York style crust is just right. The delivery was on time. We also ordered a small Greek salad and a small artichoke dip with bread. The dip was a mistake, don't order. The bread tasted the best. The dip had a rancid taste. The salad was really good.",
        "Sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I love the teppanyaki grill.  We go for Happy Hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is AMAZING! I have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have. I love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp. They also have the best drinks. I will be going back consistently!",
        "Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles.",
        "It was just \\\"OK\\\". In a strip mall. I think it caters to the younger, movie-going crowd. The food was bland. I had to wait over 10 minutes for salmon teryaki. I did not like the fact everything was served in styrofoam everything.  I will not go back.",
        "Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame.",
        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "This is the worst food I have ever had. Smelly Salmon, mushy broccoli, saw dust dry burger, rock hard ribs. Even the mashed potatoes were thick and dry. I understand this place's forte' is rock memorabilia, they should at least provide palatable food, not saw dust. They would be better off serving TV dinners. Stay away from this place. if you must go, then just have some appetizers and leave.",
        "I ordered the crispy salmon dish on a blended pea sauce.  The blended pea sauce was actually refreshing.  The salmon on the other hand was nothing to rave about.",
        "I just ate here and I order some garlic shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp was so over cooker, it was super hard and I could even taste where it was burnt on the edges. The garlic, needless to say, was also very burnt. I pretty much didn't like the salsa and beans all too much and I generally could have had a much better dining experience here.",
        "My daughter and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. So today we finally decided to come for lunch. Items tried: Shrimp & Veggie Fresh Spring Rolls and Watermelon Slush with Boba. Both items were yummy! =) The staff was very friendly and food came out shortly after ordering. Looking foward to trying other items on the menu.",
        "I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure.",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "This place is more than just salads! My fianc\\u00e9 and I came here for a light lunch because we knew we were going to have a heavy dinner. She got a smoked turkey panini and I got a fiesta shrimp panini and split it so we each had half. Both were excellent! Every panini comes with a side salad with their delicious house dressing and everything is made fresh by a very friendly staff. We'll definitely be back!",
        "I don't know how you screw up a grilled vegetable sandwich on focaccia bread, but they managed to do it. Slimey, undercooked with no flavour. Pizza was too bready. I wouldn't bother with this place. I don't even know how they call this Italian food, just bec. they put tomato sauce on it?",
        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "I was disappointed.   My shrimp showed signs of freezer burn.  Not up to the standard i expect from Bubba Gump.",
        "Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta.",
        "Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!",
        "Food's pricey & the men's bathroom is run down (the paper towel dispenser fell off the wall).  I like their fried chicken but my buddy wasn't impressed.  Don't bother with the shrimp fried rice which has the shrimp the size of krill.\\n\\nAt least the waitresses are friendly & your table having a buzzer button to call for a waitress is handy.",
        "This place is picture post card cute. From the giant bowl of latte to the almond creme croissant breakfast was perfect. My bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon was enough for two meals. The French know how to do breakfast, coffee and pastry. If you want a authentic taste of Montreal Figaro is your place.",
        "Awesome bakery but mostly I come for the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut coffee.  They are famous for their cranberry toast which I have to admit that I have never tried.  But other breads and delicious desserts keep me coming back. Nova supplies a lot of coffee shops uptown and I am delighted to support local.  Their campy sitting areas (in and outside) make me feel so mellow and relaxed - it is a great place for a book and a cup-o-joe!",
        "I love a good salad - and Sammy's has some of my favorites! They have several options in the $10ish range, and service is speedy so it's a great stop for lunch. I like the shrimp salad with feta cheese and sunflower seeds and the chinese chicken salad is a close second. While their pizzas are pretty fantastic (Brie and mushroom, heck yes!), their lighter fare is quite tasty as well.",
        "Had lunch with a colleague on a Thursday. Look over the Bento selections and against my better judgement went with the Salmon Teriyaki. Not good, not bad just very average. \\nI like the happy hour, it is always a lively time and drink and food specials are great and deserve 4 stars. Just was not impressed with lunch there.",
        "We went for Mothers day buffet and menu sounded great. Prime Rib had no taste, Shrimp was mushy, food was cold. Crab legs also mushy and no taste. Overall this is the worst Mothers day buffet we have been to. Also a party of six was charged 20% tip without telling me prior to charging.",
        "Called for the House Special Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Both sucked. I could feel the crunch of MSG on both. BBQ pork had no flavor (zero). House Special Fried Rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp. Nothing great about the ambience. Go only if you are craving for low grade asian food.",
        "The crowd was all old creepy drunk men , one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had, and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iPhone!!!! music was so loud I couldn't think.. bartender was awesome though.",
        "Superb place and superb food",
        "This place has the best gourmet shrimp, bacon & avocado tacos!!! YUM",
        "Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. \\n\\nNice low-key atmosphere.\\n\\nFood is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",
        "Edit:  I don't like this place anymore!  Last experience- the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want (and so less pad thai).  Also service was really slow for lunch.  It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares.",
        "Went to lunch to try their hotdog with chili, crab fries, and a soda special and I wasn't totally impressed. While the food was tasty, it was too simple and small portioned. (Blame myself for expecting more for only $5)\\n\\nI had my eye on the Shrimp and Grits. Looks like I will have to go take another trip (isn't hard since I live next door)",
        "Friends were staying here over EDC weekend... They had a fabulous suite that included two beds and couches and a niiiice bathroom! The beds were comfortable as HELL and the couch wasn't bad either! And when we ran out of towels, housekeeping brought us some more STAT. I'd love to unofficially stay here again sometime!",
        "We wanted to give this place a try before going to the airport to head home. The food was so dry, over cooked (burger and salmon) that I sent it back. Like other reviews the service was horrible. The wait staff sat at the end of the bar having a good time laughing and never once asked how our food was. I would recommend going elsewhere.",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "This was a great spot to take a break from it all and just people watch.  We sat at the bar facing the casino and we were entertained the whole time.  The mini grilled cheese (appetizer) was fantastic. It came with a tomato based dipping sauce that was the perfect compliment to the bite sized wedges.  Tip - ask for two dipping sauces because one just won't do.",
        "This is my favorite Thai restaurant in CLT. I LOVE the Pad Thai and shrimp rolls. The food is fresh, service is excellent and location 5 minutes from home. What's not to love about it?",
        "Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly",
        "Excellent vibe, great music, free Wi-Fi and plenty of wall outlets. A great work space.  The wait staff was very friendly.  Don't forget to check out the upstairs couch/lounge area.  While the place looks tiny from the outside, the ample room upstairs is more than enough for those with a group, or simply looking for some elbow room.",
        "Awesome Value: $25, Exceptional Desserts: Gelato, chocolate truffles, macaroons & Surprisingly Tasty entrees: Gnocchi, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Cheese Selection, Premium Italian Meat Selection, Lox and Grilled Salmon were my Favs. Consistently going back!",
        "i recently stayed here and we booked through the bellagio-mgm-mirage site. got an awesome lake view room and you can see paris right in front of you its beautiful. room service is awesome the 2.5 lb steamed lobster was so good. the omlette was disappointingly dry! the garden next to the lobby was beautiful as usual and the themes always change so theres always something new to gasp your eyes upon each trip there.",
        "We ordered to go. Shrimp good, salad great,meat in orange beef was disgusting. Beef skewers disgusting. I'm not really sure it was beef. Not trying to be gross but I have to be honest, they are not using quality products. Never again.",
        "My daughter and I ate sushi there last Friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning!!!  This place needs to close ASAP!!!\\n\\nYOU risk your life if you EAT THERE!!!  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time.",
        "As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste.",
        "I had a positively delicious breakfast on a Sunday early afternoon.  I got the breakfast quesadilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, black beans, and not enough cheese. It also comes with a side of homemade salsa that was super pureed and did not have enough heat or chunks of tomato for my liking.  Seriously though, despite these two things it was still quite tasty.\\n\\nThe place was packed but our service was excellent.  The pies/cakes looked amazing, must try!",
        "Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience.",
        "How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb."

        "Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Awful...the pork was so dry, no taste, veggies were nothing special, mostly onion and carrots, because they are cheap. The sauce (Thai) was bad, not even sure what it tasted like. Very expensive for what I got. I will never go back. No wonder it was half empty at lunch!",
        "Great patio seating with good food and tasty drinks! We had the sliders, a burger, and wedgie french fries (awesome)! Happy hour prices are pretty decent, but regular prices seem a little steep for bar food. It's a throw your peanuts on the floor kinda place--very laid back. Bonus: you can bring your dog to the restaurant!",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Stopped in for lunch on a whim. The staff was nice, the food was good. But the wait for the food was a bit long. \\n\\nI enjoyed my shrimp tacos, and my wife had veggie tacos. They were mini-tacos but also came with rice and beans. \\n\\nNot a bad spot for a drink and some grub.",
        "What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.\\n\\nService and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.\\n\\nI liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. \\n\\nTRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS",
        "We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \\n\\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.",
        "Not what I expected. It almost looked like a starbucks when I walked in BUT BOY WAS I WRONG Best coffee I have ever had! Beautiful foam designs on every coffee.. Lots of vegan choices, sandwiches, burritos, pastries, an outstanding vegan muffin and regular egg breakfast type sandwiches. A fantastic fun find and a must if you are vegan. Unique and Good",
        "Caprese sandwich not what I expected the bun should have been toasted it was just lacking flavor.",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",

        "Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.",
        "Good food. They sell kids meal that is just right for me. It includes a slider (which is pretty much a full sized burger) , French fries (fresh and generous portion) and drink, for like 6 bucks. This is my favorite airport food actually. The bar next to it is a good place to hangout for a beer when waiting for your next flight.",

        "Food was amazing.  The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us.  Service was on par for a restaurant of this level.  Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level.  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",
        "I ordered a side of bacon to go with my side of potatoes... I was siding my sides and making a meal out of it - I was having breakfast-tapas... breakapas. It was bacon - not much to say about it that hasn't been said before, however, points deducted for the slices being stuck together in a giant bacon chip, but points awarded for inventing \\\"THE GIANT BACON CHIP\\\".",

Beware that there are multiple buildings with rooms, some farther from the casino than others.",

        "Small and over priced. Had a assortment of the macaroons.  They tasted better then I expected but was still disappointed. I found that out of the five I purchased two of them were kinda hard compared to the others. The ones that did seem fresh had good cookies that were soft but had little filling. Over all I felt like I was paying more for the packaging then the actual macaroons. It was just okay to me.",
        "I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!",
        "Just orderd delivery from Katana, which was my first time having their food.   The udon noodles are delicious - maybe the best in town, definitely the best in the south hills. Decent tofu and veggies. Love that you can get brown rice, and love love love the online ordering option. Very affordable,too!",
        "While it doesn't surprise me that Aria T'Loak has an establishment in Las Vegas, I am a little surprised it would be such a posh and fancy place.  Maybe I just expected that because of what I've seen in Omega, not that Afterlife isn't a cool club, but this place is more along the lines of Purgatory at the Citadel, with its modern decor and all.  Just goes to show you that the Pirate Queen is full of surprises!",
        "At Rita's kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending; I got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of. Food is OK, expected. Big hang out place, bar area seems to be more popular.",

Both were delicious and the presentation was excellent.  I would rate Eat higher, if there were a few more vegan selections.",
        "Killer little sandwich spot. They used to have a deli downtown, but now just do sandwiches and pasts. Fresh bread, killer Italian meats and super fresh veggies! I'm itchin to try some of the pasta dishes they have, but this is THE spot for a rockin Italian sandwich!",
        "Tried to give this little place to evolve into a great neighborhood joint... Instead it raised its prices within the first month on mediocre food. A couple months later it still is serving Spring rolls stuffed with brown rice not veggies, bad Pad Thai that was too lemony to eat and tasteless chicken. The decor is nearly as bad as the food. When in the area I will dine at one of the neighboring restaurants.",
        "Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor.",

        "We got take out here. I had the orange chicken which was pretty good. The fried rice looked like white rice with some soy sauce. No veggies and only a few pieces of egg- pretty disappointing (maybe I ordered wrong) but overall taste was good. My husband had egg drop soup and general tso's chicken. He enjoyed his meal. We will be back here - just probably won't get the fried rice again.",

Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.",
        "I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.",
        "this place is beautiful, came here for a romantic dinner was lovely views of the castle - the only thing is that if you're sitting with your back to it you don't get to see much which is a little rubbish! they could rearrange the chairs and tables so everyone can see the stunning views!\\nthe food was great, as was expected and there was a waiter for every course - including for the bread, and the wine. it was great service.",
        "Pretty expensive for a burger that ran out of Cheese.  Ordered the double burger with bacon and no sauce and fries.  It came out to $12 around.  Fries were good, they tasted like lawry's salt on them.  Good thing I saved a can of coke during my first flight so that i didn't have to pay for soda.",

When our bagels took a little longer than expected we were offered 2 more drinks on the house (generous and unexpected!) - the flat white is top quality.\\n\\nEverything looks like it'd be just as good. Quick tip, 'would you like side salad' means extra salad on top of what is served with the food - it'd be cool if they made this a bit more clear!",
        "My daughter and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. So today we finally decided to come for lunch. Items tried: Shrimp & Veggie Fresh Spring Rolls and Watermelon Slush with Boba. Both items were yummy! =) The staff was very friendly and food came out shortly after ordering. Looking foward to trying other items on the menu.",
        "I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)",
        "This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it.",

Kudos to the server that got us a fresh chips and salsa refill BEFORE we asked for it.\\n\\nSignificantly better than your average Mexican joint.  Closed on Sundays.",
        "Went here last night for the first time last night... Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)",
        "This place is picture post card cute. From the giant bowl of latte to the almond creme croissant breakfast was perfect. My bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon was enough for two meals. The French know how to do breakfast, coffee and pastry. If you want a authentic taste of Montreal Figaro is your place.",
        "Great breakfast spot! Casual atmosphere and good food. Veggie Benny is YUM!",
        "I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it.  Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.",
        "Typical jack in the box.  Clean.  Staff is friendly.  Drive thru open 24 hours.  They have the self-serve kiosk, which means you can get free tacos from time to time.\\n\\nPersonal favorites include:\\negg nog shake during the holiday season\\ntacos\\nultimate cheeseburger",
        "Pros: pulled pork, barbeque sauce, wood chips, service (Dave was great), paper table covers, sauteed veggies, sweet potato fries\\n\\nCons (all were only minorly disappointing): watery lemonade, dry cornbread, no baked beans, sandwich buns, mac and cheese okay. \\n\\nOverall, would recommend. Not quite as good as billed",
        "Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.",
        "I went to see the waving cowboy the one in the opening seen the the old TV show \\\"Vegas\\\" I think its Seen better days. It has some old Vegas Charm but its Ghetto. Note to city of Vegas if don't want this place to totally die get one of those monorails to DT! Maybe better at night ill try to give it another chance.",
        "I've seen this show twice and would see it again when I go to Vegas next time!  Where else can you see a show where they built a theater just for this show?  I love looking around all the details of the theater.  This edited version really help move the show along and not let me loose interest.  I saw the movie version and went to sleep after 1 hour :(.",
        "I took my car there yesterday after it stalled at a red light. The staff there greeted me almost immediately and ran a test on the car. He identified the problem and was able to fix it right away. I was in and out within ptetty quickly considering. Very professional and gave me the information I needed to make a decision on what services were needed. No pushing or pressure to get services. Thanks Jiffy Lube! I will definitely be back!",
        "I left my expensive ray-bans on the table after eating at binion's cafe. When i returned 10 minutes later for the sun glasses, they weren't there and the waiter that served us was not to be seen. Very disappointing.",
        "Ultimate hot dog spot! I've had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and they're all crazy good! I'm usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself. Plus Bird songs Mexi Cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me!",
        "The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!",
        "Sorry, but the Cobb Salad was not nearly a good as I expected it go be.  We went with a group of 7others for an early lunch,and despite reservations, others were seated at our table and had to be moved while they were eating.  The music was terrible  and way too loud for any conversation.   My salad was accompanied by what appeared to be the bottom of a hamburger bun despite other's sandwiches being on craft bread.  Certainly not worth the wait or the money.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "Went for lunch today for the first time. HMMMM expected a little more than we got. The service was great, but the food-so-so. Both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry. I asked for extra mayo but it never came. And COKE in a can for $2.50....come on, with those prices get a fountain. I probably won't be back.",
        "A farewell lunch for a coworker landed me here.  I wasn't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal, it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do.  Thankfully, my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than I expected, with lots of fries on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus.",
        "Good food but we lately they can not get the to go orders right! \\n\\nNothing worse getting home with your order and it's not right! TWO TIMES AND A ROW!",
        "Second time in a row these people botched my order. I ordered mushrooms, I got onions, which I am allergic to :( And all I got offered was dessert. Should've been a full refund of my $$. NOT nice. They did send me a second order, which was correct, and both delivery guys were quick and very nice. But still, twice in a row? Really?",
        "Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix.",
        "Gross. \\n\\nLo Mein was incredibly salty, without much other flavor. \\n\\nEgg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",
        "No where close to chipotle. Threw half my veggie Burrito away. Perhaps meat stuff or salads are better. Not going back for sure.",
        "They have great service! Their cat fish is the best fish in Phoenix. I've gone to Mandy's down the street but it just isn't as good as Marilyn's! I'll be visiting again soon.",
        "Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is *always* important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",
        "Nice atmosphere. the breakfast is good. The staff seems friendly enough.  The macaroons are disappointing.although tasty, they are a little soggier than I would prefer. The Union at Biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 2-3 times the variety.",
        "Bad bad bad. first they don't have carne asada. Second they serve blain taco meat with no flavor. They charged me $11.75 for 2 tacos with rice and beans. At the airport gouging prices are to be expected. But an extra $1 for watered down salsa mad the experience worse. I will never eat here again because the food was disgusting.",
        "Awesome veggie burger! Cant think of a veggie burger I enjoyed more.  Everything we ordered was delicious.",
        "By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!",
        "I live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag @gangplank.\\n\\nI got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarian,but they were delicious. its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying.",
        "I think the dim sum was pretty good but their service was alright.  for some reason they seemed pissed off when they were pushing the dim sum cart.....",
        "Food is quite nice and not overpriced. Recommend Haggis and seafood! The lunch set is great value",
        "Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!",
        "My boyfriend is a brewer and I'm a restaurant manager/ bartender. The only thing better than the beer was the service! Rob the bartender is great and everyone was so friendly. Giant pretzel with beer cheese is the perfect bar snack. Go here!",
        "Absolutely Pleasant staff.  Great food, quite a surprise.  My company put me up at the Hampton Inn, so I wasn't expecting to find a comfortable place for some grub and a beer.\\nI'll make sure to come back next time I'm anywhere near Las Vegas.\\n(Try the brisket sliders, wow)",
        "Cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies. Place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days.",
        "The service is the BEST in town!  Did you know that this engine runs on veggie oil?  Good for your tummy and good for the environment.  An all around PERFECT experience.  Thank you Cpt. Bill"
