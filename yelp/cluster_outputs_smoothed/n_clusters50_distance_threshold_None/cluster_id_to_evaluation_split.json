        "Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.",
        "A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",
        "Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE",
        "The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.",
        "This was our first stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",
        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "There are some tables and a lot of slot machines. If you live in the area, it could be a good place to go and hang out. I would never recommend a drive from the strip to gamble here, but not bad for a locals hang out. With dollar beer and hot dogs, how can you go wrong!?",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\\nIt puts the whole community to shame.",
        "So much for that groupon. Tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone.",
        "Service at the Las Vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area. For some apparent reason I continue coming. Great bar food! Awesome beer!",
        "While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.",
        "The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\\n\\nI can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?",
        "I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias.\\n\\nIn the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",
        "probably the only place i come for dimsum. great prices and selections. they are always well staffed and you have dimsum carts always moving and restocking.\\n\\nthey have this coconut pastry bun. its the shiz, so good...\\n\\nmy favorite dimsum dish is the chicken feet.",
        "This is my favorite place to get boba. I usually order a taro milk tea or an avocado smoothing. I love how their reward system works by reserving 10% of your bill each time you come in. I just think they need to keep their dining area a little cleaner.",
        "Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.",
        "If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "The wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 1/2 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  (we laughed)",
        "I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!",
        "They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed, they don't have a great selection, the decor is predictable (although they do have a nice set of high tables) and the lighting is a bit weird. It is a good place to have a good conversation though - just be warned, it might leave you feeling blue too.",
        "Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.",
        "Ka did not live up to my expectations. I've always heard of Cirque shows being the \\\"must see\\\" in Vegas however, after experiencing a few I would be more inclined to tell people to skip it. About 20 minutes in to the show after the initial amazement had worn off I was bored and ready to leave. I'm sure this is some people's idea of entertainment, definitely not mine.",
        "Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \\n\\nI tried their weekly special \\\"Breakfast in Bed\\\" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG/PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "Great new frozen yogurt spot! There is a lot of choices here! you make your own selection of yogurt and choose from a wide variety of toppings.  The seating  area had some fancy space cadet chairs but not enough chairs and tables for the amount of customers.  Over all Oh Yogurt was a very clean and inviting place to enjoy a cool treat!  I would recommend to others  to try and I would definitely return.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Cottage Express is quick, delicious, and has large portions. Best take out Chinese in Hickory Grove!",
        "One of my favorite places to go and grab a med plate. The med plates here (humus, tabouli, salad & dressing, pita bread) are by far the best in town. It does get busy pretty fast after 7 and parking can sometimes be a pain. When it is full and busy, it gets hard to hear anyone talking and it's almost like being at a club.",
        "How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb.",
        "We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!",
        "We just walked out of this establishment, after having been seated and left alone with menus for 10 minutes. Tables around us were already seated and they had no drinks.  We watched as the guy that seated us walked around filling water glasses. We decided to walk down to Pei Wei for carryout instead. \\n\\nTwo stars for the comfortable chairs though.",
        "This place has great plates, ahhh gotta love the comps ;)\\nlol",
        "This place is the spot for lunch! I mean come on. Its Indian food buffet style! What's not to like about that. They serve you garlic naan or plain naan also buffet (all you can eat). The have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice. I always eat about a metric ton of food and when I get the bill... That's right $10. Starbucks costs more than that!! Definitely try this place out.",
        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "If you order online and it's wednesday or later in the week DO NOT  use 2d day UPS you will not get your part unless you're  very close by. I'm in Texas and ordered on wednesday thinking I could get my parts by saturday latest.....nope 5 days later they arrive(what the Hell is 2 day air?) needless to say no more business from me. Yes I wrote them and they didn't have the courtesy to reply either.",
        "Great big Tostones, very nice hot sauce and mojo! Everyone at my table (two who had never had Cuban food) all cleaned their plates :)",
        "Four stars only because I almost never give five...but this was definitely a really good lunch experience.  A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.  This could become a regular in my lunch rotation....",
        "They were off their game! Took 40 minutes to get our food.  Tables were dirty, customers were unhappy, food was so-so.  Just lots of little things that really built up and made for an unpleasent visit, will be hard to return anytime soon.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom.",
        "Stopped by for lunch yesterday. It was $6.99 and $1.59? for a drink.\\n\\nStarted with a bowl of hot & sour soup. Next I hit up the hibachi station. The I made a quick round the buffet station and filled up a plate. Everything was ok. I wish they had a better sushi selection to choose from.",
        "Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .",
        "I had the Full Montagu, and yea its a sandwich. Nothing more and nothing less. Not special that's for sure. It was a busy afternoon there, and the line was very long which I actually liked because I thought  that maybe it was going to be awesome. When I started on the sandwich I felt extremely disappointed. There was a little buzz about the place so maybe my expectations were too high.",
        "Ribeye steak was so salty I could not eat it. To make it worse they did not take it off the bill.  So I ate $100 dollars worth of mac an cheese which was not very good either. My friend had the filet which was ok. I would not suggest this place to anyone.  The only thing good was the bread.  We did not see our waiter after he served us for 35 minutes when he asked if I wanted a desert since I could not eat the steak.",
        "Been here a couple of times and the view is so awesome. \\n\\nThe club itself is gross- like San Jose downtown gross. I can't believe people buy tables here... I guess if you MUST fit in some hip hop into your Vegas trip this is the place to go, but you also get the same hip hop crowd.  The view in itself is worth 3 stars though.",
        "You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking.",
        "What the heck is wrong with all the five star reviewers? Went here last night. No sense of hygiene. Un-eaten bread is reused for next table. Hot sauce is put on with a brush directly onto eaten food without being washed or changed between tables. Yuck. Lost my appetite here.",
        "The food was good but the service was not... This was only the second time to Englishes however, it was the last. Both times the same server inflated the bill by over $20 Does she really think we will keep coming back if she keeps overcharging. I don't see how they will be open much longer with the way they run this place. For now I will stay away!",
        "they have phantom charges on our bill for  the natural gas for the grills and they charges us for refilling the pool after they had it emptied, take forever on fixing things. now after i went in in december to put my notice in not sure when we were going to have a house they said don't worry you only have to give 30 days notice.. lie! they are going to charge us a full extra month 1500 for not giving proper notice.",
        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "Whomp, whomp!\\n\\nHaving been to other Vegas clubs and clubs in LA, this club was boring. \\nYes, they have a dance floor, tables, an outdoor patio, but why would I ever wait to get in here when I can go to a better club in Vegas. \\n\\nNot worth it!",
        "We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share.",
        "Not very good. My friends and I were hungry, and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find. All five of us felt like our burgers were dry, when we ordered medium, and that the buns tasted borderline stale. We all left unsatisfied.",
        "I came here for a staycation and couldn't be happier. The room is fabulous and the hotel exceeds my expectations.  Food court is a hot mess. Eat before you get here.",
        "The Sunday brunch is . It's served butler style (they bring the plates to the table). All the plates are absolutely delicious. They have bottomless drinks for an extra $20. It's a great deal and different experience compared to other buffets. It's for sure worth  a try.",
        "This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competition nearby I am surprised they stay in business here.",
        "Went to dinner with my girlfriend the other night and had a fabulous dinner here. The ambiance is lovely and the Mediterranean cuise was varied and delicious. I was also pleased to see when the bill didn't break the bank. I highly recommend this cute little restaurant for a pleasureable dining experience at a great price.",
        "Disappointed!! They  forgot I ordered coffee then didn't refill then food was cold.  The two stars is they took my meal off the bill.  Will not return.",
        "I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!\\nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!",
        "I usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run. Plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up. Stems on grapes in the salad. Graffiti in the bathroom. Disappointed.",
        "We thought this buffet was at the California so upon arrival we followed the signs and ended up at Main Street Station.  It's an OK buffet, but nothing really stands out.  The service was ok, the food was average, but the parking was free and the Freemont experience was close.",
        "Had to kill some time waiting for a place to open.  Stopped in at apache and got a enchilada plate, red, cheese, actually white cheese that was melted.  I was shocked to be honest.  The sauce did seem to be tomato based which I'm not a huge fan of but it tasted pretty good.  Also at 6 bucks for that plate cheaper than most.",
        "The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back.",
        "While I have had good service at other locations, the service that my family had tonight was horrible. It took them 25 minutes before they brought out our salads and over an hour before they brought our pizza. We saw some tables turn over twice before we got our food.",
        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company.",
        "We were excited to find a well-reviewed Chinese Restaurant close to home but were disappointed after eating the food.  My 13-month old daughter and I had an upset stomach that night and my dad got sick when he ate it for leftovers.  Needless to say, we will not return.",
        "This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Montreal.  The food is always delicious.  I'm a fan of the gigi and papalini sauces.  Last night, I enjoyed the penne with scallops in rosee sauce.  Their pastas are very reasonably priced at only $11.95.  The green salad was very fresh and had a tasty creamy house dressing.  The soups are always delicious in the cooler months.  Don't miss the Witch of the Village!",
        "Great bagels, amazing pickles, and decent prices. The staff here is always friendly. The bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home. I love Chompies for breakfast. Try one of their eggs Benedict plates. You won't be disappointed.",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "Way too crowded, and not intimate at all with tables practically stacked one right over the other. If you don't have a laptop, then you will feel really awkward. The only nice thing is when it's sunny outside and you can sit on the patio with the sunflower garden they have. The coffee is mediocre. For better drinks, go down 2 blocks to Te Cafe or Crazy Mocha.",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",
        "Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",
        "We used to eat at the Good Egg on Union Hills regularly, however the service and food had been disappointing the past few visits.  It's unfortunate the manager is lazy and it has degraded the operations.  Food is slow to come out and undercooked.  They don't have enough waitstaff so our waitress was working multiple sections of tables.  Hopefully they will get a better manager soon.",
        "I love me some Merc Bar, it's tres chic from it's comfy couches to it's awesome staff.  The drinks are indeed pricey but they pack a punch so it really all evens out in the end. How can you not love a bar that's got a twin in NYC and lets you dance on the tables?!",
        "Most overpriced mediocre Asian food ever.  Everything tasted like something you could get at a fast food Chinese restaurant.  It's ridiculous that they charge $18 for a plate of vegetables and $28 for some rice porridge.  I don't understand why people even come here!  \\n\\nI would never choose to eat here if I was actually paying for it.",
        "The guys at this location have been really good to me for the car repairs that I have sprung on them on short notice. On another note if you buy tires from them they don't charge you for repairs on them. That is pretty sweet but they might try and nickle and dime you on petty stuff like license plate bulbs, I simply say thanks and change it myself.",
        "I don't get it? Is this supposed to be delicious soul food? Its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks. The water is from the tap. I expected delicious, I got below average at best. Back to the real restaurants for me.",
        "had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!",
        "I normally love this place, but the staff has changed. The hostess was so rude. Kept people waiting for days, even with empty tables. When I finally got seated, she put me right next to a table full of kids. When I asked for a different table, she rolled her eyes, and was a total smart ass. NO people skills whatsoever. The service has become progressively worse. Looks like I'll need to find a new breakfast spot.",
        "Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.",
        "I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews But when you walk in it smells of fish which isn't good The sushi wasn't that great they forgot one of the things we ordered and the service is TERRIBLE they said they were busy but there was 3 other tables of 2 people at each. Never coming back again that's for sure",
        "The challah French toast with fried chicken is amazing...until you come back. I've been there three times already, always asking for the same plate because I loved it. Then I have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next.",
        "This place is everything you could want. Friendly and engaging atmosphere coupled with delicious crepes make this place a jewel. Definitely went over and beyond my expectations.",
        "Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it.",
        "We stopped in for dinner at about 7:30 one evening. wo other tables of customers, yet it took almost 10 minutes for the waitress to get to us. Then another 10 minute wait to get our drinks, then more waiting to order our food. Seems to have taken forever to get our food, which was mediocre at best.",
        "You've got great food, no cover, stripper pole, beer pong tables, midget bar, strong drinks, fun atmosphere, no dress code, patio, food... What isn't to love about this place?",
        "The store was really good but the restaurant was terrible, the food and the service were awful. I found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate.",
        "I am a Mediterranean food junkie!! Khoury's is really authentic Lebanese food which always satisfies my cravings. It is extremely delicious and addicting! I recommend the chicken kabob plate with hummus. The fatosh salad is amazing too! I've had problems in the past with slow service but they are very friendly which, for me, makes up for it. :)",
        "Another great recommendation by our hotel's concierge. Went here for Sunday brunch. It looked as though many people were waiting for tables but we were fortunately seated at a table for 2 within 5 minutes. The service was great. The omelettes were huge. The meal was really delicious and filling.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates."

        "It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\\n\\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.",
        "Absolutely wonderful!  The food is amazing, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting. Would definitely recommend!",
        "I had the Carnitas Burrito and it had no taste. I definitely know good tasting Carnitas and must echo the sentiments of that famous line in the 1988 VP Debate when I say \\\"You sir are not a good Carnitas Burrito\\\".",
        "My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",
        "So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!",
        "Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.",
        "Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...",
        "Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.",
        "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes.",
        "Tried a few items and a flight of all of their craft brews.  Service was great as well as the food.  The manager came over and chatted us up and offered up a sample of their Octoberfest, which was really good as well.  I will definitely come back.\\n\\nTry the baby brats",
        "A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",
        "Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.",
        "Very unique and authentic breakfast. This is not a \\\"IHOP\\\" type. Everything is made and presented delicately. Will definitely go back to check out the salads.",
        "Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",
        "i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",
        "Delicious!! :) got seats within five minutes of arriving. Service was top-notch and atmosphere was great!  Portions are huge, can definitely get one order for two people.\\n\\nNot an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates, family gatherings, or any special occasion :)",
        "Solid Pita Jungle. All our food was fresh, fast, and good. A little bit of a wait on a Friday night, but not bad. Staff was fast, friendly, and courteous. Will definitely be back.",
        "Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain.",
        "Fantastic.  Only complaint was the late reservation.  Great ambiance. Great staff. Great menu. And delicious food.  Branzino and braised short rib are pretty incredible. Prices are fair based on quality.  Possibly a larger wine list (by glass). Definitely going back.",
        "I am extremely impressed with the service Copperline Plumbing (Gabe) provided. He was very professional, friendly and quick to complete the repair. I didn't feel like I was overcharged either, which is a huge bonus when dealing with plumbing issues. I will definitely contact Copperline Plumbing for any future plumbing needs.",
        "Following a bad experience with another local Mazda dealership, I took my Mazda CX-5 here for service. There was no hassle getting my free oil change service which was included when I purchased the car. I've had bad experiences at a different local Mazda dealership, but the staff here were courteous and professional, and I have absolutely no complaints.\\n\\nThey've earned my future business, and I will certainly be back again.",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Seems to want to be O. But it did have good effects, music and talented artists. However, the actual story is lacking coherency and things aren't as stemless as a Cirque show.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "The service here is horrible. We couldn't get the attention of our waiter. The calm chowder was extremely salty, they took it back to replace it, but it seems like the just added water to the bowl......regardless, it was still salty! The food wasn't that good either. It seems like the chief had a bad day, so he/she wants to make ours bad too.",
        "Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.",
        "A dying breed, unfortunately. You wonder how long before B&N is gone. Hopefully not for a while. Nothing like the smell of bound paper and coffee. It's comforting. \\nEnjoy it while you can, tons of books, magazines, music and the experience of actually holding a book, physically flip through its pages, rather than electronically. Can't beat it",
        "Seems from the reviews that more than my mother-in-law have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage. I would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car, before and after renting.",
        "This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "Big selection and nice people! Definitely going back to check out more!",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.",
        "I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \\\"Subway Effect\\\" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",
        "We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby,  Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it.  The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!",
        "My wife just got a haircut at this place and she seems to be pretty happy with her experience. Full marks for the ambience. The stylist name was Nathan and he seemed to be friendly and did a great job. Will be going there again. I strongly recommend R Salon.",
        "Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour.",
        "Went here about a year and a half ago with my parents on one of our final nights in Phoenix and we weren't disappointed.  My sister went there a few nights beforehand and recommended it to us after she went there with some friends who live in the area.  I don't know what the new location is like, but would definitely go again if in the area.",
        "Always quick and good food. Service could get a little better though. Employees always seem like they're hassled to have to take your order.",
        "I am not going to lie this gym has a variety of equipment for everyone from you average joe to you bodybuilding competitor , but the front office staff is HORRIBLE! ! They just seem like they don't want to be there!  And they are very unhelpful! I love the gym it self just not the staff.",
        "Walked around for a while and found Jason's deli.  Place was clean and I tried their reuben sandwich today.  I give the Reuben 4 stars for taste.",
        "Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "I was disappointed.  The meat was very bland and I like my meat med well.  They always had med to med rare.  Fish was pretty good without the sauce.  To me the best thing was the mash potatoes and Caesar salad.  Atmosphere was nice service was good but we will never go back again.  Definitely not worth 100 price tag.",
        "We live walking distance and frequent the store. We have purchased all sorts of groceries and steaks and have always been delighted by the superior quality of food. As far as their coffee can't go wrong, when it's $.75 for a refill.  Definitely love this place!",
        "We ate here last\\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.",
        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",
        "good drink specials. the riff raff seems to come out about 10:30-11 o'clock.",
        "Its a laid back place for sure, with all the plusses and minuses that go with that. Crackerjack super-fast service? Dont count on it. Dusty in the corners. Seems to fly on auto pilot a lot. In any case, its the bar I go to the most... so go figure. Nothing quite like it.",
        "I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday.",
        "Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.",
        "Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!",
        "These are definitely the best cheesesteaks outside of Philadelphia!  \\n\\nI am not sure why the reviews aren't that good other than the reviewers must not know what a true Philly cheesesteak is supposed to be.  Believe me, I grew up in PA, so I have eaten my fair share of Philly cheesesteaks.\\n\\nThe restaurant are clean, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious!",
        "Ka did not live up to my expectations. I've always heard of Cirque shows being the \\\"must see\\\" in Vegas however, after experiencing a few I would be more inclined to tell people to skip it. About 20 minutes in to the show after the initial amazement had worn off I was bored and ready to leave. I'm sure this is some people's idea of entertainment, definitely not mine.",
        "Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \\n\\nI tried their weekly special \\\"Breakfast in Bed\\\" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG/PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Want a pint in a good bar on Leith Walk without any hassle?  Look no further than The Brass Monkey.\\n\\nThis pub has the feel that you're still in your own living room with comfy sofas that you'll have to peel yourself off but obviously it is a bar which means no washing up or cleaning the next day:)\\n\\nFriendly locals, comfy atmosphere and fairly cheap drinks - it'd be rude not to!",
        "Great new frozen yogurt spot! There is a lot of choices here! you make your own selection of yogurt and choose from a wide variety of toppings.  The seating  area had some fancy space cadet chairs but not enough chairs and tables for the amount of customers.  Over all Oh Yogurt was a very clean and inviting place to enjoy a cool treat!  I would recommend to others  to try and I would definitely return.",
        "My husband and I came after the D-backs came.  It was expensive and had a limited menu.  Food was ok, but how hard is it for a sports bar to have good wings.  Our waitress was kind of rude, when we commented on the limited menu she told us that we were free to go to TGI Friday's.  We will definitely remember to try that next time.",
        "Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente",
        "This place has great food and great service. So good we came here multiple times on vacation. Will definitely make it one of my first stops next time I come back.",
        "Apparently if your standing under the lit \\\"order here\\\" sign and no one is at the register, the employee standing at the register over from the sign is not allowed to help you... You physically must be in his or her narrow line of sight and directly in front of their register or else in their world you physically do not exist.  In other words very poor customer service.",
        "This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that.",
        "Best music during our weekend stay for a Flirty Thirty we celebrated in September. I would definitely come back. The location was a little bit smaller than I remember, but probably because I was a lot more sober. The waterfall and outdoor dancing was a nice touch. One of my top three club choices while in Vegas.",
        "Quaint little underground bar with stone walls and dim lighting that give you a warm, homey feeling, and two terrasses that allow you to enjoy the summer breeze or catch some fresh air. The staff are cool and welcoming, the beer is great and reasonably priced, and the live bands are always jammin'. \\n\\nGrumpy's is definitely a fun place to go for a few rounds with some good company!",
        "Last night we came to Canaletto for my 30th birthday! All I have to say is delicious! Food was amazing, service was great, and the view of St. Marks square was nice too. All around great experience. We will definitely be back.",
        "Great place to spend an anniversary! They really treat you well. The service was top notch. Fried Calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce. I had the Fillet which was great. My wife had the Butterfish and loved it. The Hawaiian martinis are delicious. Would definitely recommend it.",
        "Took my 15 month old there yesterday & he loved it! It's a very clean environment. My husband & I loved that there was a wide variety of activities & toys. Highly recommend this place and the price is $12 for an all day pass. Definitely will be returning",
        "This place is the spot for lunch! I mean come on. Its Indian food buffet style! What's not to like about that. They serve you garlic naan or plain naan also buffet (all you can eat). The have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice. I always eat about a metric ton of food and when I get the bill... That's right $10. Starbucks costs more than that!! Definitely try this place out.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.",
        "This is definitely the worse beach club I have been to. Yeah its fun on certain days when Party Rock makes an appearance... otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small, dinky, and grimy pool!",
        "Great decor, professional dealers, and lots of celebrity poker players here.  Definitely worth checking out!",
        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "quite the dive, obviously a local place to gamble, which is a great secret a tourist should not be privvy to. the max bet on a slot i was playing was 60-cents. c'mon, i've played that slot b4 at other casinos and the max bet was $3.00. definitely a favorite place to gamble.",
        "I purchased a deal through Groupon for a full highlight, haircut and deep conditioning treatment. Faith did a great job on my highlights! I am really happy with the way they turned out.\\n\\nThe Beauty Venue is in a great location, great pricing and Faith has flexible hours. I'll definitely be going back for another highlight.",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",
        "Kokimo's was way better. There were about six hostesses and 10 waiters plus 10 more bussers. Waiters seemed way too freaked out to spend time at the table. The did not seem confident. Almost like they would get in trouble if they talked too much to the table.  Atmosphere looks like a lower dollar BBQ joint. Need more options besides a regular steak I can get back home for less than half the price.",
        "Four stars only because I almost never give five...but this was definitely a really good lunch experience.  A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.  This could become a regular in my lunch rotation....",
        "A nice Whole Foods, to be sure, but considering the Fry's right down the street has great produce at better prices I'm not really sure what would send me to Whole Foods aside from perhaps a search for something esoteric.  Not really much different from the Whole Foods back home in Ohio I'll still be here anytime I need bulk fleur de sel or perhaps quality coffee in a pinch, but otherwise I just can't justify the admission price.",
        "Pleasantly surprised. My room had new, very comfy beds.  No view. Price and location are great.\\n\\nIf the following did not happen, 3.5 stars.\\n\\nHowever, service is lacking. Security was rude and ignorant. Manager was rude as well.\\n\\nBetter places to stay for the same price. \\n\\nIt is competitive and after that slap in the face I will certainly go elsewhere.",
        "Just great to have a nice moment.\\n\\nBroad selection of wine. Ask for Alex's advice, he is surely one of the best sommelier you will ever meet.\\n\\nWe will go back, no doubt about it.",
        "Love this place.. It's very close to my house so I decided to give it a try.. Got a mani & pedi both gel at the same time. Was out of there in 1 hr. The girl doing my pedi gave me a wonderful massage with hot stones and then wrapped each of my legs with a warm towel. In addition, everyone was very friendly. This was a very relaxing experience and my nails look great, I will definitely be coming back.",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "I had the pastrami reuben, it was super delicious. The Nachos are definitely a must have as well!  It has a great atmosphere and the service was perfect! Can't wait to go again!",
        "I love this place and what they do. We adopted our Graycie from them and if we ever get other animals we'll definitely choose HALO!",
        "I've been to plenty of Qdoba's and this is hands down on the bottom of the list. The manager on day shift is very rude. Rest of the staff seems highly uninterested in being there. My work \\\"lunch buddy\\\" and I always used to eat at Qdoba before we changed locations, we tried eating her several times and just got tired of the manager and staff attitude. Won't be going back."

        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "Great ice cream and for a cause!  Only open during business hours.  For each different flavor a portion goes to a cause i.e. to help with someone's medical bills or to replace a home that burned down.  \\n\\nThey have about 20 different flavors and basic toppings (no sundaes).",

        "Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food. \\nI could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience. \\nBasically good for booze, but not much else.",
        "I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!",
        "I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \\n\\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \\n\\nNegative: very limited selection.",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",

The atmosphere is really laid-back and on Thursdays many of their bottled beers are half-off. I have only eaten there a few times but each time the food was delicious. I highly recommend the steak and walnut salad as well as their home-made potato chips. Boulders is the perfect place to go if you are looking for some place low-key.",
        "They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...",
        "Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.",
        "Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",
        "Dans cet amas de junk food, vous cherchez de la cuisine saine ? Vaguement europ\\u00e9enne ?\\n\\nGo there !!!",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Fantastic vet.  Very caring staff and doctors.  Nice location.  Clean.  Highly recommend.",
        "Ok. Here's the scoop. Loco moco was good, very good. RV pancakes without the chocolate, very tasty. I took to go orders of the banana pancakes. To try at the Volley ball tournament. The line can be outrageous for parties greater than 2. So waiting will be long.(expect up to 45 minutes)",
        "So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.\\n\\nWe would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \\\"intestine shaped like squirrel\\\", anyone?\\n\\nExcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment.",
        "This place still stinks.  Maybe they can become a vets office or something useful.",
        "Enjoyed the ambiance here when I passed through for a book launch shortly before the holidays. Ideal for a literary evening, or for a conversation with a well-suited friend at the bar, the space feels like it's tucked with decor brought home from long travels. Hints of Havana and East India in the 1950s when the light is just right. I only had a beer but glanced over the cocktail menu and would be curious to return.",
        "Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast. Also a decent meeting spot for business breakfasts and lunches. Personally, I think you can do better with the food but all around it is a bad joint.",
        "I had an awful experience - will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment/voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe - the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe.",
        "qualified vets and techs with a lot of patience to talk to patient owners but it is well known that Banner is very revenue focused and not necessarily suggest things that are not needed but if you took your pet to a private practice you would get just as good care and pay less.",
        "My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!",
        "I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.",
        "I live in a city with lots of great restaurants but 21212 was the was the best dining experience I've had all year.  \\n\\nI had the 2-course lunch there while on vacation in Edinburgh.  Each course was structured so to create a different combination of flavors and textures with every bite.    \\n\\nTasty and innovative cuisine.  Gorgeous building and decor.  Attentive service.  Upscale ambience.  Expensive but well worth the money.  Go!!!",
        "Not a whole lot of ambiance going on which I was used to at Box.  A very medical office type environment but the staff is really friendly.  Love the Australian wax for its gentleness on my skin but wasn't thrilled with the results.  Wasn't as thorough as other waxes.",
        "I'm only giving them 2 starts because if you're not a cowboy, you won't be welcomed. The food gets 5 stars, but after our experience I believe there exists racial discrimination from the wait staff towards the customer. And that does not bode well for an overall dining experience. IF I eat there again, I'll order take out.",
        "The cinnapies are sooo yum!  And their $5 pizzas are great for last minute potlucks.  Every time I've ordered from them my pizza was always fresh and generous with toppings.  If I had to mention a downside it's that they don't take Discover and I like when business take all forms of payment.  But that still isn't enough to mark them down.",
        "do not deal with the salesman orlando. the other sales reps warned me about him. he is a liar and his sales commission goes towards his wifes drug addiction. we regret our decision to deal with that piece of shit",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",
        "Dr. Cruz is a very good physician.  She actually touches you and listens to what you are telling her and tries to get you to the right diagnostic testing or specialist.  I have enjoyed having her as my physician and my family's physician.  The office is clean and the staff is usually pretty professional and attentive.  Not sure if she is returning to the practice so I had to find another primary care physician but would prefer to see Dr. Cruz again.",
        "My husband and I ate here today by default as we planned to eat at the Cornish Pasty next door but the music inside(and blaring out into the parking lot) was SO LOUD we had to walk out. We chose the Pink Pepper as we like Thai food. It was the WORST I have ever eaten.  THE WORST! Thai? Chinese? Who knows but the buffet lunch was disgusting. Total waste of money. Good shopping mall restaurants to avoid.",
        "Definitely NOT the original. \\n\\nI went to the one in Brooklyn, better than the LV one.\\nLV one too crispy. They also served another table our salad. Sauce was bland. I like the original better.",
        "Came here this past Veterans Day weekend.  The woman needed her Asian food fix.  I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine.  Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish.  Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better.",
        "Like previous reviews, the service sucks and not the greatest areas of town. I usually get the norm for me which is a jcf...this place is always busy and they do have a tendency to skip orders...not the best way to run a business. I guess I'll deal with crummy service vs waiting at a coffee shop.",
        "Went strictly for the macaroons and at first I was thinking \\\"three dollars for one macaroon? Nope! No thank you.\\\" but I had made the trip so I needed to at least try it out. Tried it and the macaroons were light, moist and crunchy but only certain ones are worth three dollars. This would be a place I would go back to if I was craving a certain macaroon.",
        "My gf and I stopped at Grimaldi's on our way to Los Angeles and it was just as delicious as the Brooklyn location, which I thought was excellent! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone who enjoys quality pizza. We ordered a white with garlic medium with pepperoni, artichoke, olives, and Italian sausage. We also got a small Caesar which was average. We were not at all disappointed with our visit to Grimaldi's.",
        "Decent Cali-Mexi cuisine at reasonable prices. Don't come here expecting large plates, the servings are smallish. We've been a few times because a friend loves their bar-b-que tofu, and both their vegan(ish) burrito (the Green Burrito, if I remember correctly) and the Taco Salad with tofu were satisfying. Not outstanding, but consistent, with decent service.",
        "Great place with even better staff. They're very helpful, patient and caring. There have never been any surprise bills and they're very gentle with the animals. I only see Dr. Whitcraft because she is so personable, kind and terrific at her job. I highly recommend this place, especially compared to other vets I've been to throughout the years.",
        "Friendly staff, good food and a great happy hour in an awesome modern atmosphere. I've been coming here from about a year and every time I do the food is great. They take classics Mexican cuisine and put a modern twist on it to make it fresh and pleasing.  Plus the chef visits the tables to insure everything was great tasting.",
        "I stayed here back in August of this year.  The people that work this RV resort are friendly and the grounds are both clean and organized.  \\n\\nI did not care for the location of Las Vegas outside the gates of this resort but the good folks running this resort seemed to be on top of their game in keeping unauthorized people off the premises.\\n\\nThat said, I would come back here.",
        "Been to chiropractors off and on for years.  Dr. Owen is head and shoulders above any I've ever encountered.\\nDr. Owen gets right to the issue, explains everything in words you can understand, and does not \\\"string it out\\\" - and he doesn't try to load you up with all kinds of accessory items.\\nHis concern is strictly for your well-being, and it shows.\\nThanks ever so much!",
        "I personally thought this place was terrible. I ordered 2 cheese slices and I could barely eat it. I felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheap....I certainly didn't think it was tasty or anything like that.",
        "This theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise it's never busy. I've been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when I've gone, I have received great service. I personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors.",
        "Do not use this company.  I own an electrical company and have been trying to collect payment for work we have done with this company month ago.  We have sent multiple email's and call to try to collect and have still not been paid in full.  BE AWARE!!!",
        "Great place! We decided to try and we are coming back for sure. Portions are generous, food is great, and service was fast and friendly. They have a signature jam that originally I wasn't interested in trying. Our waitress brought a side of it and I'm glad she did. I recommend this restaurant! My only suggestion would be they take your payment at the table instead of at front counter.",
        "After going to the farmers market in Guadeloupe,  this place was awful. They are way over priced on a lot of items, like fresh eggs and honey. The store had so much stuff it was hard to find items and they didn't have much local items. The service was so so. This place is more hype than anything good.",
        "This place is great ( if you know your crepes) having a European background, crepes are normally made with fruit, and are a sweet delicious treat! If you are looking for a more modern crepe, such as a lunch item, I would recommend la crepe in the Paris hotel. Personally, I love the fruit filled crepes just like Grandma used to make! So if you want a different sweet I would def try Tasty crepes!",
        "Odd location but good food. The space is not well marked. It almost feels like you are entering an underground club. The decor is industrial but the space is comfortable. The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful. We started with oysters, followed by a lobster risotto for me and Cornish hen with roasted vegetables for my husband. Everything was delicious. The wine list was different than most. Very nice.",
        "I've taken my two Shih Tzu's to this clinic a couple of times for shots and ear treatment. The vets are knowledgeable and have never tried to convince me that my dogs have any extra illnesses they don't really have. The clinic used to be a little pricey but now that they are priced the same as any other vet clinic in town it's a good clean convenient place to take your pet if you are in Southern Highlands.",
        "Meh.. Not great and not horrible. The salads are decent portions, and all my friends that got the soup said they really liked it. The sandwiches were small, there are three sandwich shops now all in the same shopping center.  I personally think beach hut deli has better portion, and better tasting sandwiches. While this place is good, it doesn't stand out to me.",
        "The atmosphere was great! The menu didn't have as many options as I would have liked. In Southern California Brunch is usually offered Sunday with bottomless mimosa's or champagne, omelette station and buffet style, but Chelsea's Kitchen is a brunch menu style restaurant strictly menu and on Saturday's they offer bottomless Mimosa's. I will have to try it again.",
        "Best Buffet I've been to in Vegas so far, but that's not really saying much seeing that I've only been to a couple.  They have some pretty solid dishes, price wasn't too bad $40 but let me say one thing KOBE BEEF / Crab legs were amazing, sushi selection kind of sucked, and the desert/fruits were nice and fresh, with that being said well worth the 40 dollars spent.",
        "They have excellent food, but the portions are average to small and the pricing is expensive for this type of cuisine. I'm not sure I would go again compared to other options I have for chinese food. The staff was average as well. I'd like to see better staff and bigger portions in the future if I were to go again.",
        "We all enjoyed the food at India Palace.  It was the best Indian food we ever had.  The service was also great.  My girlfriend had the Tandoori Dinner and I had the Mixed Curry Dinner.  Both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan.  We had a separate order of raita.  I don't think it came with our dinner dishes.  Overall, we had great experience and the food was just wonderful.  We would visit again when we return to Vegas.",
        "Restaurant is nice, and service ok.\\nAs a meat lover I never tasted anything that horrible as their prime rib cowboy entree serving.\\nChoose another restaurant !!\\nPaul",
        "The nice thing about this place is that they use real fruits. I ordered the Strawberry Banana Boba large for $4 plus tax. It was tasty; however, I give this place 3 stars because the boba balls weren't the best I've ever had. They were more on the stale side than being soft and chewy. If you're in Vegas and want boba, it's worth checking out. I'd eat here again.",
        "I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good.",
        "This is my favorite boa location. Staff is helpful and friendly. It can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here. \\nI don't mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area!",
        "I am very happy Madison finally has an antique oddities shop. I was pleasantly surprised by finding true medical antiquities and and just strange fun decor. The prices are quite reasonable and the store is displayed well. I will definitely be going back.",
        "Provably the best place in town.\\nBest Ambiance\\nBest Cuisine \\nBest Service\\nCleanliness: 10",
        "Well it was clean and the food quality was ok, but very bland.  Had all the flavor of a lean cuisine Service was friendly but very slow even though there were only 5 customers. The prices are high for Cuban /mex especially for the neighborhood.  Possibly the worst mojito I've ever had.  Not even worth a second chance.  Gets the second star for the cheesy spanish language videos.",
        "This place is great and the service is outstanding. I had never been here before and the manager personally helped me. I will definitely return",
        "This is small Vegetarian takeout Indian food place.Though the menu is limited,  food is made freshly. I tired Bombay sandwich, samosa, samosa chat, Chole, Gulab Jamun, mango lassi and Chai. I have been to this place around 6-7 times and  I have seen people coming for Tea and Samosa (5pm snack in India). Very limited curry menu",
        "A while back the two Marigold owners started a seemingly Madison revolution in cuisine and I've loved going ever since.  I love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere.  If only it weren't so chaotic and crowded, but why should I think such a great place wouldn't get noticed?",
        "Not four-star cuisine, but good Take Out.   As you can tell I am a regular lunch goer on Penn Avenue. The take out food at Fu Lai is always dependable and the price is reasonable.  Because I prefer my food to be a little on the plain side, I always get the chicken with pea pods or the chicken with vegetables.  Very satisfying!",
        "Vraiment excellent! Cuisine raffin\\u00e9e,pr\\u00e9sentation soign\\u00e9e et tr\\u00e8s diff\\u00e9rent de ce qu'on peut manger ailleurs comme tapas. \\u00c0 essayer et adopter!",
        "Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.",
        "I found the show to be extremely entertaining and funny as hell.  A great interaction with the crowd and hilarious impersonations.   The finale was my favorite.   I loved that he met with everyone after the show and thanked them personally for coming out.   If you're in Vegas go check this show out!",
        "Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.",
        "Unfortunately I got scammed into signing up for their care contract and I am so disappointed with it. EVERY single time I go in they try to upsell me something and tell me it's not covered in the pet care visits. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made. The vet techs leave my dog smelling like cigarettes after they examine them and a couple of them act as though they don't even care. Do not bring your pets here!!",
        "I had THE COWBOY! The burger meat was nice and thick. But a little dry so I asked for extra bbq. The fries were some of the best I've had as well as as the chilli. The cheese tasted like nacho cheese, and that threw me off. The service was great, and they were always on top of our drinks and food.",
        "The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \\\"MANAGERS\\\" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit.",
        "The food was mediocre compared to the Taiwanese type food I have at home. Mostly the same dishes but different flavor... I will not come back here.",
        "*Food Allergy Review*\\n\\nThey had a great selection of Gluten Free items.  All GF items had an asterisk next to the name.  Pizza, desserts, Italian, India, Latin, etc. all had GF options, and they were all very tasty.  It's good to know that there's a reliable place I can go to when I'm in Vegas.",
        "PLEASE READ FOR YOUR SAFETY:\\nStayed for one night. Checked in and had to change rooms at midnight after discovering a used drug needle in the bathroom.\\nSpoke to the front desk manager who rudely said, nothing he could do about it.\\nNo discount, apology, nothing.\\nIf you don't mind taking your life in their hands!\\nJust want to warn others of the unsafe conditions!!!!!!",
        "I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \\\"b+\\\" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice.",
        "Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...",
        "Best chorizo and carne asada around. Forget filibertos or any of his cousins. Los Favoritos is the bomb.",
        "My cousin and her fiance had their engagement party here on the Patio which connects to the lake and park. Never having eaten here before I don't know if I got the best impression from the pre-prepared catered food. We were served their sliders, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and cheese and crackers. Nothing that could really make an impression! I thought the restaurant looked nice enough, but everything came off as a little bland.",
        "Beautifully designed building with high end shops!  Unless you have a lot of money you will be doing the \\\"tourist walk through\\\" like everyone else.  I hope that they will have enough customers to stay in business.  I personally did not see ONE person with a shopping bag...and that's not a good sign.",
        "Being from the East Coast, it is hard to find an authentic New York pizza in AZ. Brooklyn V's is FANTASTIC!!!! Takes me back home.... The crust is fantastic with just the right amount of cheese. We've been here several times but haven't ordered anything other than pizza yet. Based on the other reviews,  trying the Stromboli next. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!",
        "my friend and I tried two different tasting menu there. Generally it was good, but just felt a little bit over priced. I paid 180 for mu meal in all including a cup of Rose and tip, tax. If you never tried any modern mixture of French and Japanese cuisine, I would recommend it.",
        "A few friends and I visited Mt. Everest India's Cuisine and we all agreed that we enjoyed this place a lot.  The service was very good - we felt neither rushed nor neglected. The owner is good at guiding hesitant diners to the type of dish he feels each would appreciate. We had a lot of fun sharing 5 different dishes- all were delicious.Definitely a place to return to.",
        "Ordered from Albo's for a team lunch. I personally ordered the turkey club with fries, just average to me. My team members got the meat calzone and that was better than average. I'd say overall it's a basic pizza/bar food restaurant. Beats ordering from a pizza chain. I wouldn't go out of my neighborhood to come here but it was decent for a working lunch.",
        "I personally Love Panera their food is different and tasty, Love the steak sandwich at breakfast, Frozen caramels are delicious and staff is great!",
        "If you're looking for a nice clean place to pass out from partying all night then this is the place for you. Not a glitzy hotel, but I personally would rather pay less for a room so I could have more money to do other stuff. The pool was nice and clean..perfect for 100+ degree weather.",
        "I visited Kierland Commons this past weekend for dinner, and I loved the setup! \\nIt was like metropolitan shopping village! There were a lot of great stores, and I liked that there were also smaller boutiques mixed in with the brand retailers. \\nIt is all outdoors, so it can get hot, but at night, it would still be a great place to stroll around, shop and grab a tasty bite!",
        "Consistently very good. I wanted to try something different and this time I went for the pesto scramble. I normally get pancakes or French toast . Now I don't think ill ever order anything else. I personally can't eat eggs without tobacco and I was able to eat the pesto scramble plain.  Defiantly wanting to go back soon",
        "We had a problem with the way a poster was mounted for framing at another Michael's location and took it to the nearest location to us on East Camelback. We spoke with Shane , the manager of the framing section. He was very polite and helpful. He had us leave the framed print for remounting and personally handled the work the next day at no charge. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the work and the way in which we were treated.",
        "I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers."

        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly",
        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "I am extremely impressed with the service Copperline Plumbing (Gabe) provided. He was very professional, friendly and quick to complete the repair. I didn't feel like I was overcharged either, which is a huge bonus when dealing with plumbing issues. I will definitely contact Copperline Plumbing for any future plumbing needs.",
        "One of my favorite \\\"cheap eats\\\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo",
        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "Amazing food.  The beef ribs and southern fried chicken are so good.",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",

Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food. \\nI could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience. \\nBasically good for booze, but not much else.",
        "Paid $18 (including tax and tip) for the worst beef teriyaki (lunch special) on the planet. The miso soup was basically just salt water.",
        "Quaint little underground bar with stone walls and dim lighting that give you a warm, homey feeling, and two terrasses that allow you to enjoy the summer breeze or catch some fresh air. The staff are cool and welcoming, the beer is great and reasonably priced, and the live bands are always jammin'. \\n\\nGrumpy's is definitely a fun place to go for a few rounds with some good company!",
        "Not bad. Decent sushi. The duck bim bi bap was good. Extra half star for having Orion at the bar. View of the waterfall is cool if you're into that sort of thing.",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Waiters are awesome and the food is great. I do wish the owner would allow you to order the \\\"la Potence\\\" beef tenderloin  medium instead of rare. Best dessert in town.",
        "Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!",
        "Love this place.. It's very close to my house so I decided to give it a try.. Got a mani & pedi both gel at the same time. Was out of there in 1 hr. The girl doing my pedi gave me a wonderful massage with hot stones and then wrapped each of my legs with a warm towel. In addition, everyone was very friendly. This was a very relaxing experience and my nails look great, I will definitely be coming back.",
        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",
        "I just found this place over the weekend and stopped in for lunch. This place is a New York style deli with all of the favorites; Pastrami, Corned Beef, Stuffed Cabbage Rolls, bagels, NY style cheese cake, egg creams, and the list goes on and on. This place is large for a deli, clean, great service, priced right, and generous portions. Try the bagel chips.",
        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "Not impressed! The meats were very salty! No refills on soft drinks! The filet was really dry! We were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasn't comped? Extremely over priced!!!!! \\nNot worth your money! I went to the fiesta casino buffet and paid $6.99 and had better cuts of beef than here!!!!",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "Had the Beef Bulgogi box and ordered sides of the kimchi.   WORSE BULGOGI I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Dry and no taste.  VERY VERY VERY Disappointed.  Will never eat here again",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "Was walking around the Paris Casino and came upon a bar thatwas hopping to find out their were dueling piano players. So we decided to take a listien for a few songs and wound up staying there for several hours. Anybody who can pull off Motorhead's \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" is great in my book. They were extremely funny and kept you interested and having fun all night!",
        "This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .",
        "Reasonably priced and delicious this is THE dumpling house of China-town!\\n\\nLarge variety, and always savory - definitely worth the stop. You can also make your own dipping sauce from the traditional ingredients at the table.\\n\\nYou have every meat option - veggy, shrimp, pork, beef etc",
        "Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.",
        "I heard about Cosmo and said \\\"Okay, time to go check it out.\\\"\\nSpectacular view of the Bellagio's water show. It's worth upgrading to be on Bellagio view side. Marque club is out of this world with heated outdoor amphitheater. Restaurants have great selection from Sashimi to escargot to Kobe beef made to perfection.  \\nGreat experience.",
        "This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \\\"Beauty and The Beast\\\" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\\n\\nGod bless",
        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",
        "The best pho in town! Been getting my hangover cure here for a very long time! Than, the sweet cashier girl is always so nice and remebers you everytime! \\nMy favorites are:\\nShrimp chips and spring rolls as an ap.\\nLarge rare beef pho, beef on side and extra limes.\\nyummmmmmmmy!",
        "I'm not sure what the hype is all about. We had the chicken & waffles, duck confit poutine, and a BLT. The BLT and poutine were both fine / mediocre. For me, the chicken and waffles with mustard seeds in the syrup was revolting. The decor and staff here are cool, but I regret eating here.",
        "This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location.",
        "This was very mediocre delivery Chinese food. The typical fat-laden goopy crap you see everywhere. They do deliver, which is great.. but so do many others. I didn't particularly enjoy anything I ate... I had some sort of orange chicken and a mongolian beef.. but just very *eh*. My fiance thought they were ok, so I'm bumping it up from the 2 stars I'd give it.",
        "Arguing with a fool only proves there are two!!!... a crazy lady will self destruct...trying to control everyone. And everything however just another duck....",
        "They really know what they are doing out there. Chris made the most perfect mule cocktail that I have ever had. They might not have a lot in stock, but they pack a punch with everything",
        "Had a large Pho Tai with raw beef. Absolutely delicious best pho I've had in the PHX area",
        "Very disappointed with our meal and the service. It's a new menu so there are kinks to be worked out, but it besides the beef the burger was a mess. Also, my drink was screwed up. I was willing to put up with the noise and crowd but they've really fallen off their game.",
        "My wife and I had a carryout order of orange beef and general's chicken with white rice. All were good and fresh. The chicken was thick and juicy, not thin and tough slathered with sauce to cover the poor quality of the meat. The sauces were very good. Polite service over the phone and in person.",
        "Got the Korean Burger.  Eh.  It was super sweet.  Overpowering sweet.  The meat was cooked really well but the flavors just didn't work.  Truffle mac and cheese was just not good.  Texture, flavor, cheesiness, just off.  The Grasshopper shake was very good but didn't get me to any level of drunkiness and the onion rings were pretty good.  There are better hamburger places out there.",
        "Couldn't be happier with my service and experience at this high end bike shop. I strolled in after hours in need of some gear for an early morning spin class. Steve, the owner, was on hand and took his time showing me around and offering me the best deals and some amazing discounts too! I'll definitely be back soon to purchase my next road bike.",
        "O M G. I think I died and went to Wagyu Beef heaven... Steak is amazing, service is awesome, food portions make it worth the price!! I'm coming back!!!",
        "Portillos my love. Any Chicagoan knows and loves Portillos! That being said I've tried many a replica restaurants of places I used to eat back home and usually they arnt the same something is always a little off, but not at portillos. Fresh strawberry shakes or a cake shake if you dare. Beef and cheddar extra gravy please! Portillos makes being away from home just a bit more bare able.",
        "Not authentic mexican food as advertise, disappointed.\\nBurn beef, hard to bite commercial flour tortilla, nothing to be excited about, maybe the only mexican is the owner, sad.",
        "Me and my friends call this our last stop before leaving Vegas. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef is my absolute favorites. Best hangover food other than stake and eggs.",
        "OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had.",
        "Unbelievable gem in Apache Junction!! Great beer selection and awesome service. We even ordered food after we had just eaten dinner because they serve only local farm fresh beef and produce! Great place to spend my money!",
        "Amazing dinner; outstanding service.  \\n\\nPrime filet mignon \\\"carpaccio,\\\" celery hearts, truffle hollandaise, white truffles from Alba, Italy; U.S.D.A. prime, Illinois corn fed, aged 21 days, bone in New York sirloin 20 Oz (rare); wild field mushrooms & Japanese shishito peppers... a meal to remember.",
        "It's a tourist destination, and sometimes the wait can be atrocious. So I mean you need to know that heading in. The Crispy Duck on noodles is freaking amazing, but for what it costs it should be a portion about 50% bigger. That's really my knock with LOS. The portions should be bigger given how much you're paying, or the food should just be perfect. That's where my 2 stars were lost.",
        "When in Vegas,\\n\\n1) buy a delicious \\\"adult slurpee\\\" in a delicious flavor right outside the Imperial Palace\\n2) bring said special, yard-long beverage into the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club\\n3) sing or mock karaoke\\n4) enjoy!\\n5) your pre-game is complete... time to go out!",
        "There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area, as a Chinese student, I would like to say the Szechwan palace can represent the authentic Chinese food.  I ordered Mopo Tofu, Chongqing Hotpot and Boiled beef and fish today. All dishes are really spicy and I really love it.",
        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",
        "The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.",
        "Waited 40 minutes in line at the cage on a Sunday morning. There wasn't even a lot of people in line, just really slow processing. There was a gambling addiction brochure on the counter that said \\\"the fun stops here\\\" - oh you bet the fun stopped after waiting that long!",
        "Fried okra was fresh hot and delicious, pulled pork, beef, and chicken were all served cold, so was sauce & beans. won't return.",
        "Waterfall is too loud \\nI had gnocchi, just blah.  Not bad but not good either.   Wife had beef on weck bland beef and certainly not a good bun.   \\nGreat place to come for a cocktail and hang out but get your dinner somewhere elser",
        "If I could live here I would! The service is second to none and each room is unique.\\nThey just added a B-cycle bike share kiosk and that's a major bonus. My wife and I have stayed here 3 times already and hope to get back soon for a 2 night stay.",
        "Yummy bone marrow, and oysters. Nice classy place, and great service.",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "A tip of the hat to their creativity,  effort to source locally, passion for quality, and engaging customer service.  Also, all the other superlatives that were repeated ad nasuem in the other reviews.  \\n\\nI also like that this place is literally just down the street from the Cold Stone Creamery headquarters.  I wonder how often they have their corporate spies in there.",
        "I biked all over the Phoenix area looking for authentic eggs Benedict and this is the place for it. Waffes and pancakes better than average as well, but helloooo, Scottsdale, right? If you want your Eggs Benny, NY Style. This is the place. Gets very busy after 8 am so come early. Oh and they freshly squeeze ALL their juices so do not skip the Vitamin C dose.",
        "The location is nice and the food is delicious! I got the market fish, which was very good. The meat was so tender. Other yummy dishes were duck and pork.",
        "I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.",
        "Stopped in for a drink after a long bike ride.  Total dive bar, but patrons and staff were very friendly.  I didnt have a bike lock and the patrons/owner said i could just bring in the bike while I got smashed.  I must have spent about $20 after being there for 2-3 hours.  I think the beers are $2.  Its a cash only bar, but they have an ATM in the front.  I will definitely be heading there again soon.",
        "This is the best Kabob place I've found on the East Side. We usually do take out and the meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly and the rice is delicious. Very gracious staff as well. I usually order the beef kabob and I love it.",
        "The orange beef alone is good enough to earn this place 5 stars. I thought the teriyaki chicken was a little bland, but as an out of towner, i can already say my first stop off the plane next year will be for some more orange beef. Thank goodness for yelp, because the place itself is very plain, and never would've pegged it as a place that would've knocked my socks off with the first bite.",
        "I just love the Mongolian beef, I order it every time I get take out.",
        "I struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars, really should be 1.5.  I agree with others regarding the rude/surly male employee.  I have the impression he is the owner or manager so I am not sure this will ever be addressed.  The salads are good, but value is poor.  Don't waste your time or money.",
        "Was here last night for a Family Soft Opening. This used to be Carmine's but was gutted and looks great. Plenty of TVs to watch the game. \\n\\nThe food and drink selection was excellent. The \\\"Mad Mule\\\" was a great cocktail. Food was excellent, very large portions. I enjoyed the Chicken Salad and it was delicious. \\n\\nI have high expectations for this bar. Hopefully becomes the new local spot!",
        "Got moussaka. Instead of bechamel, they put american cheese on top...interesting, cheap and not a tasty choice. So much lamb on the menu, it's hard to avoid. Just because it has lamb in it, doesn't mean its Mediterranean. Friend had beef platter. Beef too dry, too well done. For this price, you could get a lot better. Would not recommend",
        "Very minimal selection. Small seating area. Not many bikes either - mainly Felt. If you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse. If you want bikes go to a bike house.",
        "Having come from LA with a large Vietnamese community, this is not the same Bahn Mi I'm accustomed to. Heck they couldn't even make a decent vegetarian. \\n\\nI will commend them on their clean facilities and quick service however. Oh but if you're an attractive young lady expect some disrespect from the male staff.",
        "After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment.",
        "I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE",
        "Second time here, food came out very fast on a Saturday afternoon lunch time, pretty dang tasty overall, had a Pa-nang curry, pineapple fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken pad Thai. We ordered everything spicy, yet still wanted more heat! If you like your Thai dishes spicy, order it at an 11 (out of 10). Maybe you'll get lucky and get that heat we missed out on.",
        "Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.",
        "I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place.",
        "Everything is so good!!\\n\\nEspecially, Kushi and beef tongues.\\n\\nI love this place.\\n\\nYou should come here!!!\\n\\n^o^",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",
        "We really wanted to like this place given the other reviews, but came away very disappointed. Service was slow, but they were busy so that wasn't a big deal. While the Crab puffs were great, the entries were just too sugary (both Mongolian beef and Vegetable Lo Mein). We have never tasted any Chinese food that sweet (other than something like Orange chicken). Maybe it was just an off night?",
        "Excellent beef sandwiches a little to juicy but very good Chicago style Italian beef. Fries are good with there dipping sauce. Hot dogs are very good too. The cute girls aren't bad to look at either. I would share my hot dog with them and share my fries.",
        "This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The Panang curry is so good (even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it)! And their Tom Kha Kai is amazing. Other favorites are the fried rice and Pad See Ew with beef. \\n\\nThe service is prompt and friendly.",
        "No, no, no, no no!!!\\n\\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again",
        "Performance art with amplified tuned percussion, humor, audience participation, and yes, toilet paper.\\n\\nThis was a great event, a private showing of BMG sponsored by my company. The three principals, backed by drum-heavy band, bring their unique take on the human condition, the Internet, love, and plumbing, with hilarious results.\\n\\nTo respond to a previous reviewer, they plucked two of my colleagues out of the audience to interact with them. Very entertaining!",
        "Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.",
        "Came here this past Veterans Day weekend.  The woman needed her Asian food fix.  I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine.  Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish.  Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better."

We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",

        "Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.",
        "Pretty disappointing. Waited in line for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLow quality food.  Tough prime rib.\\n\\nSushi was disgusting. Very fishy.  Prepared in advance and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard. California roll and cucumber roll?  I thought this was a high end buffet. Where are the fish rolls?\\n\\nI've had comparable food at a Denny's.",
        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.",
        "Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",

        "meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "Atmosphere is 4 stars, but sushi gets 5 stars. I live nearby and I'm officially addicted to the \\\"Godzilla\\\" roll !! I've also been to the Scottsdale Quarter location, and although the atmosphere is much more hip at this location, the sushi was not as fresh as the Old Town location. Go asap and order the Godzilla roll !! It's monstrous and delicious and you will be stuffed full when you leave !!!",
        "Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",

The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!",

It truly is all things for all people.\\n\\nI only wish we had one in Houston!",
        "Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.",
        "This is my favorite place to get boba. I usually order a taro milk tea or an avocado smoothing. I love how their reward system works by reserving 10% of your bill each time you come in. I just think they need to keep their dining area a little cleaner.",

        "Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!",

        "Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.\\n\\nCibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts.",
        "This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.",
        "Food is decent but not the best in Charlotte. Went with friends on Saturday night and it was so noisy I could barely hear my friends talking to me ACROSS THE TABLE. The bar area was worse than the dining room. Lots of families go with their children.I suggest going during the week.  There are better Italian places in our fair city with a lot less noise and confusion. That being said the foodis OK.",
        "I really think this has the best ramen I have ever had. Service is surprisingly great, considering how packed it is every time I am here. Whenever someone come in town, I always suggest this place",
        "You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!",
        "This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \\\"made in the 70s\\\" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.",
        "Went to Joes this morning! First off after about 3 mins of sitting down i got to meet Joe and shake is hand! He is awesome and was sold on the place after that. I ordered the combo with two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon it was great! The wait staff is super courteous and attentive. Will be going back many times to this place!",
        "Pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below.  Pomo in Scottsdale is better and closer.  Probably won't go back. \\n\\nThe staff were not friendly and it wasn't even that busy - we went last night.  To much success has gone to there heads.",
        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "The pizza was good but their lasagna should be changed to vegetables with cheese on top.",
        "Went for Happy Hour.  Waited just about an hour for a california roll and a spicy tuna roll to get to our table.  Fish was warm by the time it arrived.  Overall it was gross, which was a shame because we have had good experiences at both the Scottsdale Quarter, and Old Town locations.",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Their 50% off for locals is a big rip off. They add on 18% gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good, it's mediocre Italian at best for their prices.",
        "I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!",
        "we had our valentines dinner here at Indian paradise, were so excited that there's Indian restaurant here in Scottsdale since we just recently moved from San Francisco. I only gave 2 stars because the food are way to expensive for what you get and thee food isn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at dinner time.",
        "Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.",
        "Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.",
        "It's like a tiny part of my years in Japan, or a stolen Post Street Japantown shopping area from San Francisco!  A nice selection of fresh food, Japanese sweets and cooking reagents, as well as various home products.  Did I mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi?  Good!",
        "This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again.",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",

        "Was lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \\n\\nFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.",
        "This place seems to be cursed. No restaurants ever make it here long-term. However, the ambiance is very pleasant, with rustic, yet modern decor throughout. The food was above average but not great. With few Italian options in the old town area, I would return here again.",
        "Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.",
        "Our experience at the Fig Tree was truly enjoyable. Visiting from out of town, we were happily surprised to stumble upon it. The atmosphere was homey, welcoming with a touch of Southern hospitality. We started out with a great bottle of Meritage and fresh bread with rosemary infused olive oil. We had a great pasta and an awesome filet mignon with yummy fingerling potatoes. We highly recommend this restaurant.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :)\\nSushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!",
        "Why wait in line every weekend to go to the popular brunch joint right around the corner when you can go to this place? The scrambled eggs, homemade tortillas, plantains, avocado, beans, feta, sour cream special is a true breakfast of champions in the best kinds of ways, super fresh and cheap to top it all. My main breakfast spot these days.",
        "Pizza Old Roma is definitely the Best Pizza I have ever eaten. Great service always, and very reasonable. If you are out and just looking for a Great Pizza this is the place. My husband is from Jersey and loves this place. Says Jersey ain't got nothin on this place. lol",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "We love Joe's Crab Shack.  We make the trip down from Scottsdale at least twice a month to enjoy Joe's wonderful Steam Pots.  A family favorite is the Lobster Daddy Steam Pot.  Even our 4 year old son loves Joe's.  Always a happy, family friendly environment.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "I don't understand all the good reviews here. The hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality. I guess if you want quantity over taste, this place does ok then.",
        "Ok so I came back here the other day, for nostalgia more than anything, and I realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else. Don't get my wrong, I LOVE Baguette Express, but it's always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing, particularly in this branch!!",
        "the food was good and had very nice presentation.\\nwe had: \\nmezza combo\\nsteak and hummus\\nfried kebbeh\\nmakanek\\nfalafel\\nmossaka\\n\\nits more expensive than what i thought it would be.",
        "In town on business and was looking for some sushi to end my evening. Atmosphere was fine the sushi chefs were very personable and willing to make special requests. The result ......the rolls were good not great.  The price was fair.  Cucumber salad was outstanding. Miso soup was okay. And of course the beer was perfect.",
        "I have been a few times and each time I am so happy I went. The food is unreal! I have tried the filet mignon, the salmon, the chicken scallopini all which melted in your mouth! They have everything from espresso drinks to top notch wine. I love the fact that is a Vegas family run establishment as well. Everyone is really so nice and cares about making you happy. Gotta love that it is a 24hr place to!",
        "Been here a couple of times and the view is so awesome. \\n\\nThe club itself is gross- like San Jose downtown gross. I can't believe people buy tables here... I guess if you MUST fit in some hip hop into your Vegas trip this is the place to go, but you also get the same hip hop crowd.  The view in itself is worth 3 stars though.",
        "Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware",
        "The fish taco was delish.  Carne asada was a bit dry.  I thought the cucumber fresca would be really refreshing but it tasted like a cleanse juice, which did not bring back good memories.  The horchata was way too sweet.  The environment was a cool 70's vibe.  All in all it was okay.",
        "I love Paymon's. During the summer they have the best cold cucumber soup! So delicious. The chicken curry, hummus, dolmas, lentil soup are all satisfying... I think I am going to go there tomorrow for happy hour! Yay!",
        "This is our quick go to.  i love the variety of single slice choices.  All of the food is always consistent and good.  I have had better Italian, however it's reasonably priced.  It is always busy and sometime hectic.  I would definitely recommend.  Much better than the other choices in the area.",
        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "DELISH! My husband and I love going here for our date nights. We both love Mexican food and there premium margaritas (which come in a fishbowl size glass) are great! I always get the Enchiladas Verdes, yum the food is fresh, the salsa's are fresh great authentic flavors.",
        "I heard about Cosmo and said \\\"Okay, time to go check it out.\\\"\\nSpectacular view of the Bellagio's water show. It's worth upgrading to be on Bellagio view side. Marque club is out of this world with heated outdoor amphitheater. Restaurants have great selection from Sashimi to escargot to Kobe beef made to perfection.  \\nGreat experience.",
        "Nice coffee shop located close to the casino and guest elevators.  I stopped in the other day to get an Italian Soda as an afternoon pick me up.  The staff was friendly and the raspberry italian soda was delicious...although a little bit pricey at nearly $6.",
        "So we end up at XS after being unable to get in to Hakkansan and trust me we were not disappointed! This place is incredible the inside was gorgeous and the outside was a great spot to enjoy the music and get some fresh air.\\n\\nWe end up seeing Rusko  and dancing the night which was a blast.  I would defiantly recommend checking it out here!",
        "We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently.",
        "Changing menu based on available good stuff, bar marco has that old world italian simplicity down with a great palate. Everything we tried was top notch. New owners make it more open and with a friendly but slightly classy atmosphere, but it's not a place you go in if you are in a rush. Like in Italy...take your time here.",
        "Excellent Italian Restaurant.\\nTheir Table D'Hote is a nice value.  Usually I have their excellent mussels to start and then one of their veal specials.   Dessert is so so.\\nAnother time  I had a scrumptious Lamb Shank dish,  however, it is rarely on the menu.\\nSuperior service.",
        "I love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale so I was excited when I found one in Chandler.  However, I was more than disappointed. This place has no business calling itself Grimaldi's and should be ashamed! I love love love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, but this location does not even compare. If you are going to pay this much for pizza it better damn well be good!! Makes me very sad and I will NEVER go to this location again. No flavor.",
        "Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \\\"etiqueccy\\\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",

        "First visit to the new second location of Pro Nails by Julie on McDonald and Granite Reef in Scottsdale. Excellent and attentive service. Friendly staff does beautiful work. They take their time and pay attention to your needs. Was very happy with the final results, so much better than the last overpriced \\\"fancy\\\" place we went to. I have found a new nail place!!!!!",
        "This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good.",
        "Spendy but the views are stunning, especially if you're lucky enough to get a table facing the Bellagio and it's spectacular fountain show.  The food was good but not worth the money by itself.  We loved the chocolate souffle and the creme broulee.\\nOh, men need to wear long pants.  We didn't know that and they let us borrow a pair.",
        "Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.\\nI ordered 50 wings to go b/c we were heading back to San Diego.  They were hot, but they tasted only ok.  I've had better at other Hooters.\\nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",
        "Unexciting, bland and expensive! \\nService was good, if somewhat snobbish. \\nFood was nothing special run of the mill bland Italian fair.\\n\\nAll in all its probably not worth it. Especially for someone like myself who is really not Italian fan. \\n\\n\\\"I no like\\\"\\n\\nEugene",
        "First time at this hotel and I love it here! Rooms are nice, hotel Is nice, no smoke smell, 24/7 Starbucks in lobby, got a cab right Away and most importantly they are pet friendly:)  walking distance to battistas yummy Italian restaurant.  Also walking distance to the strip.  Across the way from ballys hotel. Ill def stay here for future trips!",
        "Awesome! Great food, amazing sangria and the staff is very kind. Would highly recommend this place.",
        "Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.",
        "This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Montreal.  The food is always delicious.  I'm a fan of the gigi and papalini sauces.  Last night, I enjoyed the penne with scallops in rosee sauce.  Their pastas are very reasonably priced at only $11.95.  The green salad was very fresh and had a tasty creamy house dressing.  The soups are always delicious in the cooler months.  Don't miss the Witch of the Village!",
        "I paid the extra money to bypass the long line and it was well worth it. I didn't want to wait 1 hour in line with no guarantees that the line would move very quickly. I recommend seeing the view at night so you can see the sunset and the spectacular Bellagio water show. The view is worth the price of admission. The Eiffel Tower is an actual half size of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",
        "I hate the Scottsdale location and Biltmore location is passable. Airport Blanco is superior for both food and service. Ask for Jodi.",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \\\"Wilmar\\\") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out."

        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",
        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "Pretty disappointing. Waited in line for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLow quality food.  Tough prime rib.\\n\\nSushi was disgusting. Very fishy.  Prepared in advance and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard. California roll and cucumber roll?  I thought this was a high end buffet. Where are the fish rolls?\\n\\nI've had comparable food at a Denny's.",

        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.",
        "Overpriced deli if I ever saw one, but it's inside the Wynn, so what do you expect.  I only had the matzo ball soup -- giant matzo ball, and very good.  But I don't know if it should have been $8.  Inside the Wynn, though, that's a friggin' bargain!",

        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "A bit overpriced but good, not great. This place can be a lot of fun with large frozen drinks. It is a bit dark and loud, even during the day. A big minus, hold on to your hats, they charge $4.95 for chips and salsa!! For $4.95 this salsa better cure the common cold. But if this is your thing worth a stop. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",

I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti.",
        "The bar tenders are always super nice and friendly. I've eaten at this location about ten times, and the food is yum. However, I feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food. I usually eat in the restaurant, but the one time I ordered curb side to-go, they messed my order up.",
        "I think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers.  I thought the cashier was inattentive, and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customer's. The ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more.",

        "This place is way overrated. They hook you with their one signature item (a glorified Mocha Ice Blended from Coffee Bean) and get you for their overpriced basic menu items. The service is sooooooooo slow, especially for a place that really isn't that big. Good place to hang out if you're in the right mood and the right people though I suppose.",

Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",

Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",

So we tried virtually every app, the egg was the best and fries were okay when compared to the egg.  Elk ribs were outstanding and grits below I still dream about.  Wine was plentiful. Desserts were good but over shadowed by the rest of the meals highlights!",
        "Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.",
        "Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \\n\\nI tried their weekly special \\\"Breakfast in Bed\\\" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG/PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out.",
        "Great experience getting a straight razor shave for the face and head..  Extremely friendly staff knowledgeable..  I will visit this location anytime I'm in town.",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "Want a pint in a good bar on Leith Walk without any hassle?  Look no further than The Brass Monkey.\\n\\nThis pub has the feel that you're still in your own living room with comfy sofas that you'll have to peel yourself off but obviously it is a bar which means no washing up or cleaning the next day:)\\n\\nFriendly locals, comfy atmosphere and fairly cheap drinks - it'd be rude not to!",
        "I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "Best \\\"Buffet\\\" that I have ever eaten at.  From the perfectly crafted food to the small portions...this place has it all.  I will probably be eating here at least once every time I come to Vegas, it has become a staple for me!\\n\\nI suggest taking a once-around before committing to anything you choose, because there are soooo many great dishes available.  be warned, COME HUNGRY!",
        "This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\\n\\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.",
        "Professional and caring. Gary was always available to answer our questions and took extra time to explain in detail what was happening to our family. He managed the cleaning and repairs required to complete the transaction in a timely and professional manner. Even after the sale he continued to assist us, I highly recommend Gary and his company and will be using him again in the future.  Thanks again Gary for a job well done.",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail.",

        "Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.",

Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",

        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Nice selection of Fuente Cigars including some very exclusive lines. Knowledgeable and friendly staff, reasonable, not cheap cigars. Top-of-the-line cigars for the most part. And finally, a very nice lounge. Nice to see a classy cigar-bar to enjoy while my wife shops! A win-win!",

        "Having traveled to Peru numerous times, I must say that the food here is equal to or better that what is available in Peru. We went there for lunch and went back to have dinner. The owners and wait staff work very hard so that your dinning experience is well worth a visit. Enjoy!!",
        "The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory",

        "This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \\n\\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side.",
        "If you're in the mood for a sandwich and a bowl of soup after a kickass night, then this is a good, no I mean great idea! I've been here several times and they never do me wrong. Go with either the Ruben or the chipotle chicken sandwich, with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, mmmm. Time to bust through that hangover and start again. Only knock is the sandwiches are small as heck.",
        "Absolutely love this place! You instantly feel at ease and happy the second you walk in the door. Such a personable, fun and sincere staff! Dr.Ashley is a true master at what she does. This is the best Med Spa I've ever been to, and would love to spend every day there, as they're not only fun to talk to, they know how to make you look and feel beautiful!\\nThey also have great specials and their prices are really affordable.",

Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.",
        "28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word \\\"Express\\\" from your signage.",
        "Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.",

        "If you want Denny's quality food for 3x the price, eat here. I got the ham and cheese omelet which was exactly that - egg, ham and cheese for $15. \\n\\nbottom line: the food will hit the spot for late night (or should i say early morning?) cravings, but you might only want to dine here if no other options are readily available.",

        "In town on business and was looking for some sushi to end my evening. Atmosphere was fine the sushi chefs were very personable and willing to make special requests. The result ......the rolls were good not great.  The price was fair.  Cucumber salad was outstanding. Miso soup was okay. And of course the beer was perfect.",
        "Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???",

        "Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!",
        "We used to love this place but inexplicably they have eliminated waiters and turned it into a take out spot. It's one of the Most bizarre setups I have ever experienced. People are walking all over the place so you can't really relax, no bartender anymore, extremely understaffed. We will most likely never return.\\n\\nI saw the Slots turned off,, so maybe lost the gaming license?",
        "This food was horrendous. I'm not even joking and not that you thought I was. Please save your time and do not stop here. Gummy noodles and raw veggies...ugh\\nI even asked for veggies well done. They better shape up or they won't  be open much longer. Just my thoughts.",
        "Great mexican fare, absolutely tasty and well executed. Great for lunch, not sure I would have dinner there, in the Canal Shoppes mall, unless you really want to see and hear the gondoliers on and on. A bit pricey for classic mexican food, no matter how good, so rating is set  at 3.",

New owners make it more open and with a friendly but slightly classy atmosphere, but it's not a place you go in if you are in a rush. Like in Italy...take your time here.",
        "Awful. Did I say awful? This place is a real LV stinker. Over hype, overpriced, over full of itself. Whatever you do, don't order fish. I thought the place in Beverly Hills was over the top - with a view of the driveway and unloading vans and limos. Really, a mess in progress.",
        "Pretty good supermarket in terms of selection. Otherwise I thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section. Small wine selection, but the wines in stock included a few decent picks.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me."

        "The worse Denny's I've been to very rude employees very filthy  never eat there again",
        "I wouldn't give any stars for this dump of a place ... The floor was dirty , some of there machines were broken  &  filthy .. No manager or workers to be found & when they are around , they are rude  ..  I've been to this place twice and would never come back . I would rather pay more $ at a place that is clean and have friendly  helpful workers . I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy .......",
        "Drove by the other day, and it has a new name and a sign looking for employees. Looks like it's no longer Dragon :(",
        "Great service and a cool setup! Cool employees and friendly.  Prices are great!  Great selection of eliquid.",
        "Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)",
        "They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.",
        "Enjoyed the ambiance here when I passed through for a book launch shortly before the holidays. Ideal for a literary evening, or for a conversation with a well-suited friend at the bar, the space feels like it's tucked with decor brought home from long travels. Hints of Havana and East India in the 1950s when the light is just right. I only had a beer but glanced over the cocktail menu and would be curious to return.",
        "Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution.",
        "Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers.",
        "Unfortunately something isn't the same - I can't put my finger on it, but the service and food has changed from what Ted's used to be- even at the Buffalo NY locations. It doesn't feel like a family owned business and the employees just don't seem to care. The hot dogs also taste different that they were 20 years ago- cutting costs?",
        "After seeing my 2nd show here, I can say it will be my last.  Super over-priced drinks, and if you aren't near the stage, it's almost impossible to get a good view.  I don't know why bands continue to have poolside concerts.. The Hard Rock pool is even worse.  I'd much rather see a show at a regular venue with a decent layout.",
        "Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.",
        "I will not be back to this restaurant. I placed an order for pickup last Thursday for myself and a co-worker. I had the small jerk meal and my co-worker had a side of collard greens. The chicken was hard, dry and cold. It wasn't fresh.  It was pulled from the fridge and put in the microwave. The beans were hard and rice chewy. The collard greens were bland. Very disappointing. I will not be back.",
        "Pros: Very fun and friendly, energetic employees. Delicious drinks. Smoothies for the kiddos. I love going to this place.\\nCons: Poor location. The parking lot is congested so it makes the one line very long and challenging to get through as they sometimes stack people in two lines and try to get them to merge into one.",
        "Have enjoyed your theater many times and certainly would attend more often if it were not for the great distance.  We live in Sun City West and would really like to suggest some thought to opening a theater in that northwest vicinity.   With the communities of Sun City, Sun City West, Sun City Grand and Surprise, I believe the attendance level would be excellent.   Meanwhile we shall continue to visit the Tempe location whenever possible.  Thank you.",
        "I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious.\\n\\nThey have the best chicken sandwich (The Original) in town.\\n\\nI would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing.  Who wants to drive over trash?  Not me.....",
        "Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.",
        "I'm surprise they are still around since Lululemon has been forced out of cities (such as in Cambridge, Ma) by its citizens or forced to close their doors because of lack of profit.\\n\\nLululemon is a sexist and racist company that fat shames their own customers. They exploit their employees in the Us and abroad.",
        "I'm pretty sure the speaker is broken or the employees are just poor listeners because the past 3 times I've gone here (over a two year time frame), they've gotten my order completely wrong. Normally, I wouldn't be so cross about a wrong order, but I don't realize it till I get home.\\n\\nAlso, they have the weakest churros I've ever had. It's just dough and nothing else.",
        "I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.",
        "\\\"Honestly guys I know you guys are busy today but please don't be rude to me n tell me to make a reservation next time and turn your back n continue talking to your friend so rude. I walked out and went next door where I was treated like a guest and waited 30 minutes, and enjoyed my meal. Don Vito's is way better.",
        "We went for the free frozen yogurt and toppings today.  The shop was located on W Flamingo Rd/I-215 in Las Vegas.  There was an employee standing at the door handing out small cups.  This location had Taro which a lot of locations don't have, so I filled my cup.  We also received a coupon for free 5 ounces, so we will be back.",
        "Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your money",
        "If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner.",
        "this place is like a lost mazed, even the employees don't know where they put their stuff. Target is much better place to shop",
        "I really like their food, especially their breakfast burritos and chocolate shakes. The service can be a little slow sometimes. I've gone there to eat at the restaurant and ordered the same thing to go and the to go meal is like 1/2 to 3/4 of the meal you eat there. When I bring it up to then they argue and say it's not true. Whatever. I will continue to go here but only for their breakfast burritos.",
        "I wasnt expecting this place to be a Fairmont reunion site, but it was a pleasant surprise, it seems like a lot of my co-workers go here, quite frequently, and it just reminds me of the local bar scene. \\nThe drinks are affordable, theres a smoking section on the patio (yessssssss) and the appetizers are worth trying. The service can be hit or miss, but I'll definitely be checking this place out again.",
        "My wife just returned from here. First, they didn't want to do her nails because she didn't have an appointment (even though the place was more than half empty and 3 or 4 employees were surfing the web or texting on their cell phones). Ridiculous! They finally agreed and then did a CRAP job! Cut her cuticles until they bled. NEVER AGAIN! BEWARE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",
        "Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.",
        "Would not  recommend this place to anyone!!! we got stuck in the elevator for an hour and had to pry ourselves out of elevator b!!!!!! We  told Christopher Greene the assistant security supervisor who did nothing and laughed in our faces and gave his us his card for doing nothing about it. Everything about this hotel was okay but they way he treated us really says something about how they can let things slide, specially with bad attitudes and bad customer service!",
        "I've only been in Charlotte for a couple years and this is the first auto garage I've used down here. It's owned and operated by two brothers I believe. They did a great job and worked with me on the price. In the end I feel like they are a very reputable company that won't rip you off. I actually need to have some work done on my wife's car and plan on calling them to do the work.",
        "I struggled between giving 1 or 2 stars, really should be 1.5.  I agree with others regarding the rude/surly male employee.  I have the impression he is the owner or manager so I am not sure this will ever be addressed.  The salads are good, but value is poor.  Don't waste your time or money.",
        "I have the worst and most expensive 10 minutes pedicure here. For $45 the pedicure was not special at all!!! The pedicure chair was not comfy at all. It doesn't have where the water  was bubbling. All you do is soak your feet in a garbage bag. The worker there is not friendly at all especially Nina! She is very loud and rude. I will never come here nor recommend  anybody!",
        "No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade.",
        "3 out 4 delays in 6 month period that's unacceptable . We are gonna find a different airline",
        "Honestly, this place was Eden to locals when it first opened. Nowadays it's super bro-like and bathrooms are filthy. Service is below average but the premises themselves are \\\"okay\\\". \\n\\nThe games certainly make up for the lack of quality but I do wish the place was as awesome as it was when it first opened.",
        "Yesterday, the SCOTUS granted Hobby Lobby its petition that it be treated as a person, with religious beliefs and religious freedoms, and the ability to deny its employees equal access to healthcare. Just as Hobby Lobby can now pick and choose which equal rights it wants to support, I can pick and choose never to shop there ever again.",
        "I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE",
        "Generally, Walgreens is a great organization, but they definitely have a bad apple with this store.  Rude, inconsistent employees.  I complained to the Walgreens corporate office about them, but no response.  I guess corporate does not care about customer service complaints.",

        "I like almost everything about LVAC except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while I'm trying to relax in the jacuzzi. I don't like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer.  Note: It was not during the cleaning hours that is posted.",
        "Went here with the husband and our 2 teens and we all get something different so we could share. Everyone enjoyed their smoothie and the employees here were very friendly. \\n\\nI just wish these dang things were a little less pricey...and i would eat em more often, they are like having a meal.",
        "Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs.",
        "After a year in Portland, Oregon we have found a single spot for decent BBQ, and it was much more expensive than Joe's for much less food. We will struggle on here in the Rose City (loving the city just not the lack of good BBQ) as we continue to pine away for Joe's...",
        "Good visit to Vegas recently. Disappointed with MGM. Service is not good anywhere we went at MGM. Over priced for the quality. We cruised most of the other hotels and casinos on the strip and MGM won't get my business next time. Not that they were bad, but, their competitors were certainly better.",

        "FUCK YOU APS!!!!  A $5 \\\"convenience\\\" fee for paying online?  I'm already paying 3 or 4 times the electricity cost due to your \\\"fees\\\", but its just a slap in the face when you slap a \\\"convenience\\\" fee onto an online payment.  APS is nothing but a sucky greedy company that has a monopoly and treats its customers like shit.  FUCK YOU APS.",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",
        "The location of this place is pretty unfortunate (in the ghost town that is City North).  And I might be spoiled by other yogurt shops, but the variety seemed to be lacking.  The saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price Tuesday Twitter word of the day!",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",

        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.",
        "I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work.",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\\n\\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \\n\\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came.",

The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \\n\\nI tried their weekly special \\\"Breakfast in Bed\\\" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG/PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out.",
        "Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty.",
        "Best \\\"Buffet\\\" that I have ever eaten at.  From the perfectly crafted food to the small portions...this place has it all.  I will probably be eating here at least once every time I come to Vegas, it has become a staple for me!\\n\\nI suggest taking a once-around before committing to anything you choose, because there are soooo many great dishes available.  be warned, COME HUNGRY!",

The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.",
        "Took my 15 month old there yesterday & he loved it! It's a very clean environment. My husband & I loved that there was a wide variety of activities & toys. Highly recommend this place and the price is $12 for an all day pass. Definitely will be returning",

They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",
        "Nice selection of Fuente Cigars including some very exclusive lines. Knowledgeable and friendly staff, reasonable, not cheap cigars. Top-of-the-line cigars for the most part. And finally, a very nice lounge. Nice to see a classy cigar-bar to enjoy while my wife shops! A win-win!",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "Majestic Cabinets refinished the cabinets in my entire house. They did an amazing job and the price was very reasonable as well. They were flexible as well when I changed my mind on color in the kitchen. They also have several other references that you can call that all recommend this company!!!!!",
        "Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.",
        "Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.",

        "Astonishing place!  Every time we go we are surprised by new dishes made with fresh seasonal ingredients with a wonderful combination of flavors, textures and wit.  This is our favorite restaurant in the Midwest (beating shallow show spots like Alinea to a pulp) and rivals places like Tilth in Seattle for our top spot overall.",

We still had a great time. The costume was amazing, the performers were great, and the photographer outside of the theater was amazing as well. All in All A+++++",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "This place has a very pleasant environment. Lots of TV's.  Patio area is very well connected to the inside of the restaurant. Service is good but the best of all is the food.  Every dish I order is good and for appetizer the fried caramelized brusselsprouts are the best.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "Food was fair, heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didn't like their noodles. Service was good, for the quality it was expensive.",
        "The worst part of this airport is their designated recharge zones are cramped, awkward, and there's never any power outlets available. There are scattered power outlets in very strange places throughout the airport so if you see a bunch of unrelated travelers stand around a wall of open space, they have struck gold. Wi Fi is free!\\n\\nThere's a lot of cute little shops to look at including an oxygen bar, a chocolate shop, and random souvenir items.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :)\\nSushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!",
        "I guess I was expecting more.  The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good.  But I guess growing local and being \\\"fresh\\\" come at a cost.  Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.",
        "The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.",
        "We love Joe's Crab Shack.  We make the trip down from Scottsdale at least twice a month to enjoy Joe's wonderful Steam Pots.  A family favorite is the Lobster Daddy Steam Pot.  Even our 4 year old son loves Joe's.  Always a happy, family friendly environment.",
        "Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it",
        "Well, in more recent visits here the flavor selection is really limited, and not good. They usually have 1 SF flavor now and it's not good. The regular yogurt itself is just so-so. Not nearly as creamy and delicious as it used to be. When stores change hands you can usually tell a difference. Sorry!",
        "They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.",
        "I was in town for a business meeting and looked on yelp for a good place to eat, Solo did not disappoint! Great service and delicious beers as well as a yummy pizza! My co worker and I split a cheese and meat appetizer which was also very tasty! It's a family business and we even got to talk to them, very nice and helpful! Recommended highly!",
        "This small shop recently had a refurbishment but  the sort of tacky accessories, ideal for a festival, a rave or a dress-up party are still the same.\\n\\nIt's a bit of a random selection of stuff and don't expect stuff to last more than really a night or two. I like the pashmina selection- quite affordable, but really not the type of store to write home about as their seem to be a lot of similar little shops about.",
        "Great place to shop at, a lot of different stores to choose from.  Parking is fairly easy, especially when it's not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days.",
        "I ordered 3 eggs and bacon * includes three pieces of bacon that didn't look very appetizing and cold toast I expected better from Bellagio I have has better bacon at Mom and Pop places..\\n.",
        "Are you in the mood for Chipotle?  Would you like to pay twice as much for half as much food?  This is the place for you!  It is absolutely not worth the price.  Chips and queso are $3.25 for a single serving.  To-go dishes are NOT microwave safe (found out the hard way).  At 8 pm I had to check the hours of operation because staff treated me like I was bothering them after hours.  Save your money.",
        "The last time we tried to go here, the Bouncer was not at his post, we walked bye and he quickly called us over then proceeded to eyeball us and give us extreme attitude!!!  Lay off the juice! We went in and waited for 15 mins and one came to our table... We left.\\nI would never go here for any reason! But girls are Drawn to this place, this Place and Chevy Trailblazers... Go figure!",
        "This is where you can get not only good Oreintal food but good American choices. They have a wide selection and a sushi bar that is one of the best around. I love it when they have the dishes I like. I don't like it when something I usually like is not available. The sevice is always very good and all you can eat wow! That is good for the whole family or a group of people!",
        "Not the greatest mall in the valley, but also not the worst! Decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court. They recently added an aquarium which I think will add to the appeal. It's a shame that they closed Gameworks.",
        "I'm really glad these tickets were free because I knew it was a dud the first 10 minutes of him going on and on just talking about the whole 'mentalist' background. This show couldn't have been over soon enough, a real disappointment and not at all entertaining. Skip it!",
        "Two words- cheap, good. Lunch specials are very affordable and the portions aren't too bad. So many noodle, rice and a la carte dishes to choose from. To be honest the quality is better than Sam Woo's. Come here for lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed!",
        "Food was authentic and yummy. It was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine!! What a concept. No cork fees either.",
        "I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is great - every person really friendly and helpful. My favorite dishes  are the chop chop salad and pork fried rice. The bartenders will make you a special cocktail if you give them a basic flavor profile, which is a great way to try a new drink or two.",
        "I thank God i got the tickets for free. Otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in Vegas. The women were hott, but the overall performance was really bad. They tried to mix in comedy and singing as well. Just horrible show. I did see only three couples walk out.",
        "As some one who has been coming here for years, I can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss. My family loves the baked spaghetti, pizzas, calzones, pizza muffins, and eggplant parm. I've had several of there other pasta dishes (eg: alfredo) and was not a fan. You just have to know what to order from there. The pizza and calzones are awesome!!!!!!",
        "The location is great (being in the centre of Places des Arts), and the decor is great. They have really good cocktails but the food is just below average. Go there for the drinks and the ambience, not for the food.",
        "Well I went in here looking for gifts for others, but only came out with stuff for myself....hummmm something is wrong with this picture! \\nI love Ross stores, I shouldn't have even started looking for stuff for me, it get's me every time!",
        "Meh, I don't get the big deal over this place. Ordered the Mel's \\\"special\\\" breakfast (toast, eggs, taters, and a side dish) with a milkshake and it came to $10. It may sound okay to some but that was one of the most mediocre dishes I've ever had; certainly not worth $10. Buy yourself some eggs and fancy bread and you'll be much more satisfied.",
        "All of the dishes were fantastic, when the new owner took over. Now the dishes have been of such poor quality that I would rather eat \\\"Asian\\\" frozen food.",
        "We've been to this place a few times in the past, always heartily satisfied with our favorite Vietnamese dishes, but were still amazed with how they've expanded their menu  that's probably drawing this large late, Sunday night crowd. Lobster with black pepper beckons!  As always service was great.",
        "The name has changed three times and every time this place has done this, the taste has declined. Spicy chilly mint was one of my favorite dishes. Pad Thai is also no longer the same. It has become to sweet. Also They have smaller portions now.",
        "This is a great place to go on a cold winter day. The food is both spicy and warm. First I usually get a bowl of what seems to be miso soup, which is complimentary with your meal. They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people",
        "Big mall, with all the good shops just like down in H-town. Hollister and abercrombie. They even have the ABC store. You can buy like chips, drinks, and shirts and hats here. The mall is nice, and the convenience  that it was within walking distance of my hotel.",
        "A delightful waiter...excellent mango mojitos...a most interesting appetizer...a delectable pan bread, very good entrees.  What's not to like?  Although the restaurant is in the Pima Crossings strip mall, the owner has done an excellent job with the internal decor.",
        "Love that they put this downtown and spruce things up. Very hipster and artsy. Lots of boutiques and unique eateries. They also have a stage and have bands play. If you go to the entrance, they have this huge preying mantis that has fire coming out of its antennae. Apparently it was in Burning Man. Also, they have doggie days once a week and you can bring your dog. Definitely worth checking out.",
        "This evening we had bacon rapped dates, ahai tuna, chicken, hummus, bbq sliders, Mac & Cheese, all appetizers evening. Excellent service and ambiance was wonderful for a private dinning. Music was light in the background. The dinner was a quick yelp decision but, Embers is a romantic environment to slow down and enjoy a late night bite.",
        "I've eaten a ton of Thai food...no, like a TON of a Thai food, there is a place to get Thai on every corner in Chicago. I have to say, the flavor was very bland. Nothing that made it memorable. The service was great but again, the dishes were just bland.",
        "Great selection of teas, but didn't seem all that knowledgable or helpful in selecting them.  I expected a little more from a place not competing on price or convenience.  The experience was pretty standard hippie meh.\\n\\nI expect specialty stores to command subject expertise.  I thought it was a bit lacking.  I might go back but not in the near future.",
        "The noise,lights and animals are merely a cover-up for the slow service, lackluster food and expensive dishes. Don't expect to add a house salad to your $12.48 turkey wrap ladies and gents here they want 4.49 to add it as a side. $37+ later we won't come again.",
        "I usually love shopping at outlet malls. But St Jacobs Factory Outlet Mall is just so depressing.\\n\\nThere were hardly any bargains. And the stores and the merchandise were both so outdated. \\n\\nNot worth coming here for a special shopping trip but if you are in the area and have nothing better to do and outside is freezing cold.. then maybe.",
        "If I could give 10 stars, I would. A friend and I literally stumbled upon this pizzeria on our attempt to make it to Crescent Ballroom. We sat at the bar, had a bottle of wine (great Italian variety) with amazing apptizers, we almost past on pizza until we noticed the owner watching every pizza cook individually and making sure each one got just enough heat . Finallly people in AZ who know pizza. Thank you. Traditional pizza done right.",
        "I've been going to Phuket for several years. The food is on par if not better than other Thai restaurants I've been to in the city. The curry dishes are very flavourable.  The menu has also been expanding adding in other Asian dishes. Throw in excellent friendly service and you have a nice eating experience in the East End.",
        "PAYMORE.    Just like all the other reviews.  I was swindled.   I returned the car 95% full on gas, they then decided to charge me 29$ for additional gas.    Oh and I love when they say it's only 200$ for the week.  Get back and random fees equal up to 430$.   \\n\\nHow are these people still open?   I want to call the Better Business Bureau",
        "The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes.",
        "Amazing dinner; outstanding service.  \\n\\nPrime filet mignon \\\"carpaccio,\\\" celery hearts, truffle hollandaise, white truffles from Alba, Italy; U.S.D.A. prime, Illinois corn fed, aged 21 days, bone in New York sirloin 20 Oz (rare); wild field mushrooms & Japanese shishito peppers... a meal to remember.",
        "Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.",
        "I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.",
        "Best strip club in Vegas because:\\n\\n1. Two minutes from the Strip\\n2. Evil Vampire Barbies galore\\n3. wood paneling!  and framed paintings!  oh my\\n4.

        "It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking.",
        "Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.",
        "So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "This is the poor mans Paradise Bakery. Sandwiches are 95% bread and my Thai lobster curry soup was missing the lobster. It took all my energy not to ask for refund.",
        "Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!",
        "I used to live in Thailand, and this is one of my top choices when I'm on this side of the ocean. Friendly people and the most authentic Thai food I've found in Phoenix.",
        "OK, so this place is not favorable. I do not want to incite any horror sensations. But this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days. Skip this place if you'er craving Thai, go elsewhere.",
        "This is a fun place to gamble on the cheapo slots.  They have a lot of fun & interesting games that I had only seen at this property.  Don't expect a lot of waitress service, but if you want to bang away on some slots and be able to move to a lot of different machines in a couple hours, you can do it here right in the middle of the strip.",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "Definitly enjoy the pad-thai, very delicious food.",
        "There are some tables and a lot of slot machines. If you live in the area, it could be a good place to go and hang out. I would never recommend a drive from the strip to gamble here, but not bad for a locals hang out. With dollar beer and hot dogs, how can you go wrong!?",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",
        "quite the dive, obviously a local place to gamble, which is a great secret a tourist should not be privvy to. the max bet on a slot i was playing was 60-cents. c'mon, i've played that slot b4 at other casinos and the max bet was $3.00. definitely a favorite place to gamble.",
        "The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere.",
        "Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.",
        "I did not like the food. I see a lot of oil in curries. I don't recommend this to anyone.",
        "Had curry noodles with chicken, as spicy as they make it. It was pretty spicy, but I wasn't crying and sweating from my forehead like a few of the other good pad Thai places around Vegas. Chicken and vegetables were fresh and simple. I will have this again for sure. Eat it with chop sticks,everything just falls off the fork. \\nVery nice atmosphere, very friendly, extremely attentive staff.",
        "Billy's ultimate steam pot and oysters are great. It sits right by the water too.",
        "What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "HORRIBLE customer service!! After 10 years of my 5 children seeing them and hoping each time they might be more friendly or accommodating, but continuing because we live so close. We are done with you Mesa Pediatrics! We are paying customers with great insurance, you could care less. We are taking our money elsewhere!",
        "Amazing pancakes!  We had a few samples brought out for our group this morning and they were perfect. We had the server pick the spread and it would not have been my first choice, glad we let him. They were perfect! !",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Good spicy Thai food buffet",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "My favorite Thai restaurant, in fact, we don't like to go anywhere else!  I drive from Summerlin area to Henderson to get my Thai fix, that's how much I love this place,\\n\\nPad Thai - scrumptious, perfect blend of sweet and savory, not oily or dry\\nPanang curry - love the mixture of coconut and curry\\n\\nYou won't go wrong with this Thai choice.",
        "Pros: Nicely laid out store with a wide variety of vintage merchandise.\\nCons:  Booths are not individually signed with percentage off discounts for store sales which makes things rather confusing.  Employees are hard to identify as they don't wear aprons, badges, etc.  Your purchase will be wrapped in used newspaper instead of clean wrapping paper.  All things that can be improved upon for a better shopping experience.",
        "Hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island. Great Thai food and really cheap prices.Be prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small. Must try..",
        "Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.\\n\\nThe crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless.",
        "James beard nominated chef, gourmet magazine says best Thai restaurant in north America, wine spectator award...All True and more.  Anyone who rated this place less than 4 stars needs to go back to panda express where you belong.  Incredible food, amazing wine list that's has some bottles of wine below retail.  Nothing else compares!!",
        "Beautiful new Thai restaurant. Great atmosphere, excellent service and absolutely delicious food.  The 2 course lunch special is a great deal.  I will definitely put Gaati on my short list of favorite restaurants!  Plus the owners ROCK =))",
        "I love that you can make your own samples here. It makes the experience so much easier and makes for a quicker decision!\\n\\nThey also have a great assortment of flavors and toppings. You can either go healthy and fruity, or decadent!\\n\\nAnd really cute spoons!",
        "This place is great for a business hotel or if you don't gamble and/or with the family.\\n\\nBig, comfortable, well appointed rooms.  Nice pool, decent bar and food.\\n\\nNo casino, but a little walk to Caesar's.\\n\\nThis is my detox hotel.  Usually I book a night or two here before staying on the strip.  Keeps the expenses down  LOL.",

        "Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average.",
        "Worst customer service. Waiting over an hour for my \\\"freaky fast\\\" food to be delivered. Days later, I realized my credit card was charged incorrectly. Instead of the management being customer service orientated and making it an easy situation to fix; they were the exact opposite. I will never be returning, nor would I recommend it to any friends or families in the neighborhood.",
        "Best oyster shooters!  Get the lobster bisque!\\nService and view were amazing!\\nWaiter went out of his way to retrieve my Rewards Card!  Complimentary champagne since we were celebrating two birthdays!  We had a great time and a lovely meal!",
        "We were told to arrive early so we arrived before they opened. The outside of the restaurant is a little seedy but the inside is completely different with very efficient and friendly wait staff.\\nThe yellow curry was the best I've ever had outside of Thailand. The tom yum soup was divine. I wish we had this kind of Thai food in the east coast!",
        "I've eaten a ton of Thai food...no, like a TON of a Thai food, there is a place to get Thai on every corner in Chicago. I have to say, the flavor was very bland. Nothing that made it memorable. The service was great but again, the dishes were just bland.",
        "Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",

        "This year was horrible no info on website , very confusing . They said a shuttle was offered and nobody had any idea about it . I saw people lined up at 2 gates that never opened because nobody knew what side the entrance was on .  They posted on face book at 2:45 pm come see jabbawockeez at 3:00 pm at 2:59 they said it was cancelled . Red dragon is obviously only interested in making money not in customer service . We are so disappointed .",
        "Stopped in this great pub tonight.  Holy cow there were 48 diff beers on tap.  My husband and I dont really drink beer but the bartender was great.  He let us try some samples.  We decided to order food.  The menu was small but had a great choice of burgers.  I had a Sunny side up.  Fried egg on it.  I loved it.  It was perfect.  My husband had a Kentucky Bourbon burger.  He loved it as well.",
        "What a disappointment.  Saw on facebook that their fall produce stand was now open.  Arrived to a few buckets of greens, one box of potatoes, pumpkins and jars of salsa, butters and a few other things.  No one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us.  We could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to.",
        "Worst vegas experience I have ever had!! The entire casino went down and would not let me cash out. Hundreds of angry gamblers last week. Had to wait two and a half hours to be manually paid out on my machine. Ordered a rollaway bed...took another 2 hours. Never again!",
        "I was really disappointed at this place. The oysters were disgusting (not cleaned or sweet). The combo pan roasts that yelpers raved about had no lobster and the broth had a lot of crab shell. Not worth the wait or my time. To top it off the chef was rude and not professional. Never again Oyster Bar.",
        "I don't even like giving one star. Really wished I'd checked here first.  As stated in the other reviews, I haven't been able to get an apt., or talk to a real live person, only told to send an e-mail.  The address is still listed incorrectly.  I would say there is \\\"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE\\\"  at all.  How do you run a business  like this and expect return customs",
        "Yummy bone marrow, and oysters. Nice classy place, and great service.",
        "I love thai food and eat it whenever I can. This is the first place in the whole valley I have found that serves my favorite dish evil jungle princess. It is so tasty and they do it very well. They are always busy and servers are always working hard. My fiance has had a few different dishes and is always happy with his picks as well.",
        "Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !",
        "Had the chicken pad thai.  The noodles were overdone, the chicken was gross (not sure what other word to use for it), and the sauce was sickeningly sweet.  Wouldn't go back.",
        "If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff. \\n\\nThe food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty.",
        "Wait staff was friendly only thing positive about the place.  Walked in the floor was sticky.  Went to open the menu and the menu pages were stuck together.   I ordered oysters on the half she'll and they came out warm.  We left after that was not interested in finding out what the rest of the food was going to be like.\\n\\nWARM OYSTERS!!! Make some one deathly ill!!!",
        "Went here for a few cocktails last Saturday night and the sofas are comfy, the cocktails damn tasty and the nachos were lovely. The jug of water for the table had an orange wedge and hibiscus flowers in it, yet this seemed more like a touch of attention to detail rather than pretension. When a place is that classy and yet seems totally laid back, it's a place to go back to!",
        "Delicious Thai food! \\nWe enjoyed the -\\n\\nPad Thai veggie : 4 star excellent taste and texture!\\nDrunken noodles chicken : 5 star- incredible flavor!\\nRed curry chicken: 5 star very good!\\nGreen curry pork 4 star yum!! \\n\\nIf I lived here it would be my go-to Thai place!!!\\n\\nKeep up the good work !",
        "Love it! Very intertaining. Way better than I thought about a hynosis show.",
        "Second time here, food came out very fast on a Saturday afternoon lunch time, pretty dang tasty overall, had a Pa-nang curry, pineapple fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken pad Thai. We ordered everything spicy, yet still wanted more heat! If you like your Thai dishes spicy, order it at an 11 (out of 10). Maybe you'll get lucky and get that heat we missed out on.",
        "Prices are a bit more than $5 so a bit misleading. Food was average except Thai which was the only dishes worth getting. No credit cards and $1 charge for debit.  It is a smoky dive where you need a key to get to the restroom.",
        "They have the BEST springrolls---not fried!  We also love their pad thai---spiced to your palate.",
        "Cost $500 every time came here to have yummy sashimi, but the last time really sucks! One oyster stink n wholly smell. Was of my favorite but won't go there again",
        "Tried to give this little place to evolve into a great neighborhood joint... Instead it raised its prices within the first month on mediocre food. A couple months later it still is serving Spring rolls stuffed with brown rice not veggies, bad Pad Thai that was too lemony to eat and tasteless chicken. The decor is nearly as bad as the food. When in the area I will dine at one of the neighboring restaurants.",
        "My husband and I ate here today by default as we planned to eat at the Cornish Pasty next door but the music inside(and blaring out into the parking lot) was SO LOUD we had to walk out. We chose the Pink Pepper as we like Thai food. It was the WORST I have ever eaten.  THE WORST! Thai? Chinese? Who knows but the buffet lunch was disgusting. Total waste of money. Good shopping mall restaurants to avoid.",
        "Finally great Thai food in Arizona! And in Cave Creek to boot!\\nBest chicken Pad Thai  I ever had.\\nPriced right as well.\\nWe will be back very soon.",
        "This place is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The Panang curry is so good (even my husband who is not a fan of curry loves it)! And their Tom Kha Kai is amazing. Other favorites are the fried rice and Pad See Ew with beef. \\n\\nThe service is prompt and friendly.",
        "No, no, no, no no!!!\\n\\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again",
        "Good soup, if I am stranded in summerlin I know exactly where to go if I want a Thai version of Pho.",
        "Scottsdale standards?  Stay somewhere else and gamble here if you want. The pool is mediocre. The restaurant choices are not spectacular except Orange Sky- i really felt like i was on a carnival cruise with all the alcohol fueled tattooed gents and stiletto heeled teeny boppers here. Save your money and gamble and stay somewhere else.",
        "Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken.",
        "We have been eating at Sesame Inn since we moved here six months ago.  We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings.  We particularly like the Spicy Thai Basil Tofu.  Hearty, spicy, vegetables that are al dente and the tofu is cooked just right.  The service is always excellent. Food is always hot off the stove and consistent in its preparation.  We are \\\"regulars\\\" now.",
        "Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there.\\n\\nThe food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!\\n\\nOverpriced for the quality of food and service. \\n\\nI highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.",
        "The best conference facilities I have been to in Phoenix.  Parking can get tight as another poster mentioned, but I think that is unavoidable.  The food is fantastic and they have snacks and drinks available during the day.  I don't like the tiny cups & water jugs to drink from.  I understand eliminating plastic bottles, but the cups they provide are too small.  Really a minor inconvenience though.",
        "Great chicken fingers. Bland and boring coleslaw. Regular old krinkle cut fries. Come for the chicken fingers and cane sauce, skip the rest.",
        "Their food is okay, but they continuously change their menu and business name. It's very very irritating and confusing. I am done ordering from this place.",
        "MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food.",
        "I had the clam chowder and a dozen oysters. The chowder was very creamy and thick.. it almost had the texture of a potato soup. The bar seats around 25 or so people and there are a few tables. There a good selection of dishes. The oysters were sweet, but on the smallish side.",
        "For the price I expected more, a lot more.  I went here for lunch about 5 years ago and was disapopinted by the lack of selection.  There are many other better buffets to choose from, like at Paris, or Encore/Wynn.  I would skip this one, not worth it.\\n\\nDerek",
        "Benjarong is one of our favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Not only is the food authentic and delicious (their heat scale is very accurate), but the service is really attentive and always consistent. We especially love the Pad Thai, won ton soup, Thom Yum soup and pineapple fried rice. An excellent place for a lunch date or with coworkers or family.",
        "The oysters were good but the cocktail sauce they give you was just okay. The oysters also had a slimy look/feel to it. \\n\\nThe combo pan roast was delicious though. I highly recommend it. You can order one and split it with a friend.",
        "Great experience with these guys! Professional, quick and very affordable. I highly recommend you hire them if you need sprinkler help.",
        "I walked here from the strip because I thought it would be an adventure, and it was!  \\n\\nGot to see some cool, and at times, strange live music\\n\\nAlso got to see the last band of the night get kicked out of the establishment\\n\\nStickers everywhere!",
        "The garlic chicken is awesome. And the pad Thai is about the best ever.  We checked out the reviews and was do happy we did.",
        "Odd location but good food. The space is not well marked. It almost feels like you are entering an underground club. The decor is industrial but the space is comfortable. The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful. We started with oysters, followed by a lobster risotto for me and Cornish hen with roasted vegetables for my husband. Everything was delicious. The wine list was different than most. Very nice.",
        "This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place.",
        "Love this place, but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation?  The website and voice message give conflicting hours/days of operation?  Ultimately, the kitchen closes by 6 pm--super tough to make dinner plans!",
        "I stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding, and let me tell you this place has everything for everyone. The kids loved the Tournament of Kings, the wife loved Thunder from Down Under.What more can u ask for, as for me I just wanted to gamble. It's pretty cheap too if your bringing the whole family. Couldn't have asked for a better time. Cool hotel!",
        "Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(",
        "Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow.",
        "Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :("

        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "talk about the perfect place for all your EDC and or any other rave needs! fun costumes, jewelry, and an array of nylons im sure you'll find anything you need here. if your a go go dancer in town this is a must store. the owner is super nice and helpful as well.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",
        "This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.",

        "Genuine waitstaff...\\nGood greasy burger and fries...\\nGreat funky feeling!",
        "Calamari was ok, breaking was that crispy but overall it was good.  Ordered New York style because it was the special.  Not impressed with the crust. Usually the crust is nice and crispy.  This time it seemed like there was too much sauce because the crust was soaked and chewy.  Sauce and cheese were good.  Still hasn't swayed me. Metro is still totally worth it.",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",

        "Happy we have another bar in charlotte,  but have been there twice now and the wait for a drink does not make sense.  When you are paying a bartender $8 an hour and charging $8 dollars a drink do the math.  I wish you well, bit not sure I will go back.  Get it together guys.......",
        "Stopped here even though I'm way against anything to do with \\\"Sun Devils\\\".lol.  \\n\\nGreat beer selection of super hard to find brews. Even better wine selection downstairs and a laid back lounge. We stopped by and the wife had a glass of wine and I had a pint of Beer Republic beer. Great bartender downstairs with knowledge of beer and wine. I would totally come here to shop and have a drink downstairs in the lounge.",
        "It's cheap soup with cheap veggies, but when you're a college student and you're hungry and poor...this is a place to go.",
        "Great place to get books for a broke college student!  Friendly staff and a great selection.",
        "Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.",
        "It's the bar in the center of the casino.  Open 24 hours.  Bartenders were hit or miss.  The best ones were usually late at night showing why they got the better shift instead of the 7am shift.  \\n\\nCheck in on Foursquare at Pour 24 and then go down the escalators to Center Bar and snag your free jello shot! Bonus!",
        "Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again.",
        "Super greasy, really cheap prices but somehow they still retained some quality in the food. The pizzas here are pretty good. I wouldn't ever crave them, but I wouldn't be opposed to going here if someone suggested it.\\n\\nThe brownies are really good!",
        "Great gym. I loved Becky's Zumba classes and the Functional Fitness 6am classes. What really made it worth it was Cheri's helpfulness in regards to membership issues.",
        "I am not going to lie this gym has a variety of equipment for everyone from you average joe to you bodybuilding competitor , but the front office staff is HORRIBLE! ! They just seem like they don't want to be there!  And they are very unhelpful! I love the gym it self just not the staff.",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!",
        "Picked up a Pizza tonight and it was terrible. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I made sure to be there at that time.  The box seemed warm but not hot.  I didn't really think about it though until after I tasted it.  For almost $18 this should of at least been hot. The crust was chewy not crisp at all.  Not worth it.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "The cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,\\nhorrible cheese.",
        "This is the place to go for all of your beer and liquor needs.\\nThey really are the cheapest in the city.\\nI come here for Heineken only.

I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "Horrible, horrible place.  Wannabe Paris Hiltons abound as do the greasy Rico Suave guys with their striped, button down shirts (top buttons undone to expose their drain clogging chest mat.)  Semi-famous hockey players, people palming Benjamins, washed up celebrities (Britney for New Years?!  C'mON!) and the Pussycat Dolls get to cut in line.  Once you're in, you have no idea what all the fuss was about.",
        "Expensive drinks at $15 each, not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it. Interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes, etc which added some fun.",
        "Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.",
        "First timer here and I can't believe I actually paid $20 for a one day pass. Not even a free trial. Gym was super packed and machines were a good wait. Other than that, they've got every machine. This gym is OKAY.",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "We had such a good night here - great atmosphere, fantastic band (who took requests from the floor), a really good Irish dancer and far too much Guinness (a bit pricey but it is Vegas!). We stayed for 4 hours till closing time.",
        "Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave",
        "It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. \\n\\nMeh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food.",
        "Chef John sucks at everything. Luckily for him Anna is a great bartender and is super hot.",
        "I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",

DO NOT EAT HERE!!",
        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",
        "The music sucks! Dj was really bad. Bunch of guys and not enough females. Dance floor too crowded",
        "The shower drain was clogged....The rooms aren't that great, but if you're a poor college student or poor postgrad...then it's not that bad.  Great location.",
        "I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "What a HORRIBLE experience!  The dance floor was like a moshpit with angry, ugly people.  The lines at the bar were 5+ deep and not moving anywhere.  The layout makes it impossible to get from one area to another.\\n\\nThe ONLY upside is that on the outdoor patio there is a great view of the fountains at Bellegio and of the eiffel tower.",
        "Good vibe, good food. Too loud on weekend nights. Make a choice, nightclub or dinner.",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place.",
        "I came into WILD after the gym and had dinner at the bar. The salad I ordered came out fairly quickly while the pizza took half an hour. I liked the smoked tofu in the salad but the dressing was too sour. The ingredients on the pizza worked really well together but there was too much lemon vinaigrette on top which overpowered the goat cheese and the caramelized onions.",
        "I've tried many other barre classes around town and nothing compares to the classes I have taken at TenPoint5!

        "In town on business and was looking for some sushi to end my evening. Atmosphere was fine the sushi chefs were very personable and willing to make special requests. The result ......the rolls were good not great.  The price was fair.  Cucumber salad was outstanding. Miso soup was okay. And of course the beer was perfect.",
        "Harlow's, you are overrated.  Your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  Your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. The toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.\\n\\nI do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a Tempe tradition, go to Chompies or Essence.",
        "This place has awesome burgers that are hand made when you order them. They are pricey, but you get what you pay for. And they always have the day's sports running on all their HDTVs, which gives a nice vibe. Their outdoor seating area is covered, and really nice too.",
        "No Reservations available after 5 o'clock which totally sucks. They have no phone charger station which sucks. The waitress was phenomenal and extraordinary. But had to deal with a new bartender tonight who took forever to make dreams because he was new. Outside of the waitress I will not be back here again after 5 p.m.",
        "We used to love this place but inexplicably they have eliminated waiters and turned it into a take out spot. It's one of the Most bizarre setups I have ever experienced. People are walking all over the place so you can't really relax, no bartender anymore, extremely understaffed. We will most likely never return.\\n\\nI saw the Slots turned off,, so maybe lost the gaming license?",
        "In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza.",
        "The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!",

        "Was there on Sunday afternoon with my wife. Maybe 5 customers in the place, but the service from the bartender was absolutely nonexistent. Will never go back!",
        "If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",
        "Went here before the Foo Fighters last night, the place was crowed and not staffed at all, I was waiting at the bar for 20mins and the bartender never came to our side. This place can't handle big events downtown, Stay Away....",

Pizza was room temp and a very thin crust. Wings were pretty good, I would order the wings again but might skip on the pizza. If I ordered again as it took a long time to get food.",
        "We used to go to this restaurant all the time and used to love it. They recently changed owners and this places is not the same. The menu is different.  The drinks are not as good. The origin of the wines are no longer shown on the wine list. The prices are much higher. The place has lost its Spanish ambiance.  The little touches such as the shot of liquor at the end of the meal has been discarded. Would not be back again.",
        "Consistently disgusting food and bad service. Tonight I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which tasted frozen and was very greasy. The white sauce tasted canned. Our service was terrible. We waited twenty minutes to have our order taken and had to ask many times to find our waiter. Just terrible and overpriced. Oh, and we asked that our pecan pie be heated and it came out cold and tasted packaged as well.",
        "I give this place 5 stars- not for the rooms but for the staff who were amazing- I left a bag with a laptop in it & staff/security - got home to southern cal before I realized it- The security staff- lost and found - hotel front desk- went above and beyond to locate it for me - thank you paris staff for exceptional service during a difficult day- great location- loved pool & DJ - fun for couples",
        "I expected really amazing mexican food in the southwest, but I've only been disappointed. The food at Roberto's is heavy and greasy. There was runny sour cream poured on everything and it was outrageously salty. I tried it once and I haven't gone back.",
        "SOMAny places I would rather eat.  I understand this is supposed to be lighter healthier fare, but I was very disappointed by my salad.  VERY.  It was the salmon salad and the dressing was too vinegary and too off.\\n\\nI won't be returning, so I won't be trying anything else just to see if maybe I ordered the wrong thing.",
        "Decent Chinese for the money, its not spectacular, but it is good, especially the Sesame Chicken and the Shrimp Lo Mien.  The food is a little greasy, but the portions are big and the rice is good. There are definitely better quality Chinese restaurants in Charlotte, but if you're in the University area and needing some Chinese, this place will scratch the itch.",
        "Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back..",
        "Fantastic pizza. Great to have them in town making authentic thin crust pizza. Tried four kinds all great.\\nWithout a doubt the best pizza in town. Crust was cracker thin! Spectacular.",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back.",
        "I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is great - every person really friendly and helpful. My favorite dishes  are the chop chop salad and pork fried rice. The bartenders will make you a special cocktail if you give them a basic flavor profile, which is a great way to try a new drink or two.",
        "Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution.",
        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company.",
        "I been coming here since I was a kid and I love it!\\nI could never get sick of this pizza.\\nSomething magical about the sauce they use, and the crust is very original.\\n\\nI now live in California and I rarely get a chance to enjoy Barros.  I have yet to find a pizza place in California that compares.\\n\\nBarros come to Southern California please!!!!",
        "You could not stop me from 1 staring this company. I have said before a bad company can't hide. Worst customer service ever (agreed). Chronic problems with web mail unresolved after years! If you don't like the cable service then get free cable with an antenna. They had a monopoly almost until Century Link came along but again you can get FREE HD cable (40+ channels) with an antenna. Vote with your feet (by walking away).",
        "Hey forget what you heard! This bar is beyond awesome with cheap and an awesome beer selection! Bartenders and staff make you feel like part of the family because that's what they are about. And I gotta say their burgers are great! 90s is the shit! Ya it's smokey but whatevvv.. You will have an awesome time I'm sure of it",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "We were told to arrive early so we arrived before they opened. The outside of the restaurant is a little seedy but the inside is completely different with very efficient and friendly wait staff.\\nThe yellow curry was the best I've ever had outside of Thailand. The tom yum soup was divine. I wish we had this kind of Thai food in the east coast!",
        "If Mickies was not on campus I am not sure if it would make it like it does but it fits perfectly into student world. Huge mounds of food for cheap and seat yourself atmosphere that makes this place feel perfect for any poor college student or alum who wants to pretend they are still in school. The fact that they do not take credit cards is a pain but only adds to the feel of the place. Somehow it all feels right at Mickies.",
        "I dined here on Monday 04/29. I ordered the Korean steak tacos, they were ok but nothing special. The vanilla bean cheesecake however was good. The waitress young lady long blond hair, was very good and attentive.",
        "Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",
        "If I could give 10 stars, I would. A friend and I literally stumbled upon this pizzeria on our attempt to make it to Crescent Ballroom. We sat at the bar, had a bottle of wine (great Italian variety) with amazing apptizers, we almost past on pizza until we noticed the owner watching every pizza cook individually and making sure each one got just enough heat . Finallly people in AZ who know pizza. Thank you. Traditional pizza done right.",
        "Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.",
        "Stopped in this great pub tonight.  Holy cow there were 48 diff beers on tap.  My husband and I dont really drink beer but the bartender was great.  He let us try some samples.  We decided to order food.  The menu was small but had a great choice of burgers.  I had a Sunny side up.  Fried egg on it.  I loved it.  It was perfect.  My husband had a Kentucky Bourbon burger.  He loved it as well.",
        "Nightclub:\\n\\nThe venue is on the small side, I felt really cramped walking around and especially trying to get a drink. It looked like there was just the one bar, and it line was 4 customers deep all the way around the bar. BUT all us girls in our group got free drink wristbands so that was cool, and it bumps up my review 1 star haha.\\n\\nI enjoyed the music and had a good time on the dancefloor.",
        "There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible.  \\n\\nThe girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",
        "So..this place is cute!  Huge dance floor!  The whole place is huge! Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders.  The guys there seem pretty lame though.  Cool place to get dressed up and dance.",
        "I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now.",
        "Sat at a mostly empty bar took the bartender Nikole about 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge me and had a rude attitude and large use of continuous profanity. \\n\\nFood was good I ordered from the restaurant with decent prices but ate my food and went elsewhere due to that bartender"

        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking.",
        "Been back several times and I will say they have some pretty legit shakes. They are huge! I like the chocolate chip one. The banana split is yummy, too. \\n\\nI had the food once and was not impressed. Will not be doing that again. This rating is solely for their desserts as that's what I go back for now.",
        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.",
        "I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu",
        "My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",
        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good.",
        "Went here with some coworkers for lunch. Was not impressed with the pizza at all. The garlic bread tasted store bought. Will not return.",

I'm already paying 3 or 4 times the electricity cost due to your \\\"fees\\\", but its just a slap in the face when you slap a \\\"convenience\\\" fee onto an online payment.  APS is nothing but a sucky greedy company that has a monopoly and treats its customers like shit.  FUCK YOU APS.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "The food is tasty, but pricey, huge portions. Service was just okay, even though there were no other customers, and despite the fact that I did state it was my first visit, the girl helping seemed annoyed that I had to think for a millisecond about what I wanted.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza.",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "The effin service sucks!! All 3 servers were rude, never smiled and when I would ask for something they would just walk away.. I would never come back to this place.. Crab is so salty n what I said b4 SERVICE SUCKS!!!!",
        "Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",
        "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",
        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "It was hot outside, but cool inside. We went for an AYCE lunch and enjoyed every bite. The service was fast and friendly. This is no non-sense eating establishment. Most of the clientele with the exception of yours truly were locals. The experience was good, presentation of the food was nice and everything was fresh. We will be back. I have the feeling that if you go for dinner you better plan on waiting cause this place is a local favorite.",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",
        "Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up.",
        "Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street.",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back.",
        "If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes.",

        "Pretty disappointing. Waited in line for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLow quality food.  Tough prime rib.\\n\\nSushi was disgusting. Very fishy.  Prepared in advance and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard. California roll and cucumber roll?  I thought this was a high end buffet. Where are the fish rolls?\\n\\nI've had comparable food at a Denny's.",
        "Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!",

We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.",
        "Best dentist and office in Vegas! After going through quite a few dentists after my move to Vegas I am so happy I came across this office! The staff and dentist are so friendly and genuine! I highly highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a true dentist and not someone looking to just make money from insurance companies.",

        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "Both fortunately and unfortunately, this location makes a great and consistent coffee. However, time is money and these folks are chatty and sloooow!\\n\\nI sat in the drive thru last week (after ordering one Vento coffee ) for 17 minutes. There were only 2 cars in front of me... Seriously?",
        "I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.",
        "Lunch on the patio also amazing.  Can't wait for happy hour.",
        "A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",
        "We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel....",
        "The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",
        "meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "Delicious!! :) got seats within five minutes of arriving. Service was top-notch and atmosphere was great!  Portions are huge, can definitely get one order for two people.\\n\\nNot an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates, family gatherings, or any special occasion :)",

        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "A good place to grab a quick bite or snack and coffee at Caezar's Palace.\\n\\nI had a delicious (and large) chocolate chip cookie with a 16 oz. mocha iced drink.  Both were sweet and good. Seating was in the main Food Court area, but plenty of spaces to just relax after walking around the Strip. Good spot to sit by the bar seats so you can people watch while you chill here. \\n\\nFriendly service.",

        "Had lunch here today and more than a few times..always good for me..The owner and his daughter are not the happiest of people but they get the job done.(the mom is super nice!).   To Dad and daughter Your customers will either make or break you..! So be nice and say hello ,thank you and have a good day. If your considering eating here..ENJOY! I always do.",
        "I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones.",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty.

The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!",
        "I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!",
        "Most boring strip club in Phoenix metro. For typ Sat nite, Paid 13 bucks cover, yes 13! Why 13?  Then one bud light bottle cost 6.25 round that up to 7 for tip, then a lousy table dance for 10 bucks. I lost 30 bucks in 15 minutes. After that, I even rejected one girl cause she looked high on something and ugly with her eyes half opened. I am a local and I am never going back there again.",
        "I really liked the atmosphere here but I went when it wasn't very crowded (around 2). Otherwise I wouldn't have liked it nearly as much.",
        "I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "This was our first stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",
        "This garage is hit or miss.\\n\\nCompletely depends on what is going on (events etc...) Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\\n\\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!",
        "Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \\n\\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!",
        "Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck..",
        "Came here a few weeks ago with friends. Breakfast was good, tea was nice, atmosphere ok. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. I love the location and the interior is vintage and original. The outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather. Moderately priced.",
        "Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",

        "When we were still living in Gilbert AZ me and husband went this place countless times. Whatever we tried did not disappoint us. Their Lad Na is so good. Our all the time favorite is grilled salmon with mango salad. Cooked to perfection.  \\nLadies are friendly and helpful.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "Cool spot sitting right above the water outside people watching. Seafood tasted frozed and not fresh never a good look for a seafood spot. Bikers were in the way of the service staff slowed service down a lot. Might return for lunch",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.

The day prior they had a LARGE group of guys from near and far and they had an amazing time golfing!  We had my daughters wedding and reception and it was so beautiful!  Kristina is the bomb!!!  The is a true gem!  It was all just perfect!    \\n\\nJacque Ast\\nMother of the Bride",
        "Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.",
        "Don't bother with the grilled chicken it was mostly bread, the club was better and whats the deal with refills.",
        "The service here is horrible. We couldn't get the attention of our waiter. The calm chowder was extremely salty, they took it back to replace it, but it seems like the just added water to the bowl......regardless, it was still salty! The food wasn't that good either. It seems like the chief had a bad day, so he/she wants to make ours bad too.",
        "if you don't eat here at least once in your life you haven't really lived a fulfilling life .. from the smile and the service the food is just to die for .. ONE NOTICE don't use the wash room !",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "We stumbled in off the plane and had a tasty lunch. For 2 people - calamari a la plancha, xato salad, scallops in romesco sauce, white ceviche and raspberry tuna skewers - it was all good and beautifully presented. No drinks. $80 for a light lunch felt a bit steep.",
        "I think they changed the owner or something.  I used to like this place, but today i bought sweet and sour chicken, it smelled so weird.  Like something is just not right (old ingredients? or old rice?).  This is my first time writing a review online and this restaurant deserve my time so that i can warn everyone about this place.  Save your time and money, and maybe your health by avoiding this place.  It used to be a good restaurant, not anymore.",
        "Gus's is a fifties-themed diner, so ambience is what it is--get over it.  I've been here for breakfast a few times, and I'm happy to report that the fare is just fine.  The service is friendly and attentive. I can't remember the last time (if there ever was one) that I was blown away by breakfast food, so what more can you ask for?",
        "Terrible service, the food was okay. Restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food. We were literally the only customers.",
        "Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.",
        "What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality."

They even got me involved with the setup of the balloon which also added another level of interest to the whole experience. Would very much recommend this company to anyone in the Phoenix/Glendale area!!",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",

        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",

Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",

First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",

        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",

        "Kokimo's was way better. There were about six hostesses and 10 waiters plus 10 more bussers. Waiters seemed way too freaked out to spend time at the table. The did not seem confident. Almost like they would get in trouble if they talked too much to the table.  Atmosphere looks like a lower dollar BBQ joint. Need more options besides a regular steak I can get back home for less than half the price.",

        "This morning was my 1st time here. Might be my last. Service was adequate. Kind of slow but she was very friendly. Coffee was good but my main complaint was that my French toast was only Luke warm and not the tastiest. Maybe I'll give it another chance. Although I'd rather go to places I know I love like Layers and Sunrise cafe.",
        "It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place.",
        "I highly, highly recommend the ladies at Fit for a Bride for any alterations for special occasions! They just did the most amazing alterations job on a bridesmaid dress and are super reasonable.

Definitely will use them again!",

        "This place always has very long lines, even at the self checkout stations. On top of that several of the checkout stations are always closed. I can understand being too cheap to keep the checkout lines adequately staffed, but closing self checkout lines while customers are spending several minutes in line just seems malicious.",

        "I paid the extra money to bypass the long line and it was well worth it. I didn't want to wait 1 hour in line with no guarantees that the line would move very quickly. I recommend seeing the view at night so you can see the sunset and the spectacular Bellagio water show. The view is worth the price of admission. The Eiffel Tower is an actual half size of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",
        "Hotel rooms are pretty gross. Carpets are so dirty that our feet got black. When we first checked in, there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows. GROSS. I guess you can say that you get what you pay for.. Cheap hotel. At least there was a mini fridge.\\n\\nBuffet was awesome though!",

Huge mounds of food for cheap and seat yourself atmosphere that makes this place feel perfect for any poor college student or alum who wants to pretend they are still in school. The fact that they do not take credit cards is a pain but only adds to the feel of the place. Somehow it all feels right at Mickies.",

        "a one hour wait on a thursday around 845? not cool. then having TERRIBLE service because it's close to closing time, definitely not ok. foods OK. (i like their sanwhiches/pasta, but pizza is average.) not worth the wait.",
        "Horrible service, ok burgers, good fries. Overpriced and a la carte ordering (burgers and fries separate). Waitress didn't place our order with the kitchen then offered 15% off after waiting 1.5 hours for burgers and fries. Nice patio seating in Oakland.",

As stated in the other reviews, I haven't been able to get an apt., or talk to a real live person, only told to send an e-mail.  The address is still listed incorrectly.  I would say there is \\\"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE\\\"  at all.  How do you run a business  like this and expect return customs",
        "very frequent guest of this location and have never left upset of the food or service.  all the staff is friendly from the busboys on up to management.  their food is good and reasonable and large servings.  I have eaten here for all meals the only thing I would not reorder is the Cadillac meatloaf, everything else has been superb!",

They talked me through all of the steps and completely eased the anxiety of ordering/booking a trip from Boston to Vegas. The cake was a huge hit and exactly how I pictured! And it wasn't just beautiful to look at, the taste was delicious. I'd recommend Las Vegas Custom Cakes to anyone!",

The tellers were just chitchatting and that's what upset me.  I had to get a cashiers check with they did with ease, and actually waved the 8 dollar fee, so that was a plus that made it an even A-ok in my book.",
        "We made the mistake buying a expensive deal voucher expecting a high end Chinese meal. The food was bland. But worse was the miserable staff. Not a smile among them with the exception of our waitress. I'm beyond upset that I spent as much as I did for 10$ Chinese deal.",

        "Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.",
        "Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service.",

Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \\\"certified technicians\\\" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else.",

        "Horrible service! Do not come here ever. One time I came to the store 15 mins before their closing time and they didn't let me in. Another day I came 40 mins before they closed and they were rushing me to the cashier the whole time. Super rude! Also, one day I asked for the price of an item and she said \\\"I don't know\\\" and walked away.",

        "The Sunset Caf\\u00e9 is quite a find. The food is incredible! I would suggest the jumbo tamale or the enchiladas. That is if you can stop eating the chips and salsa. This place is a hole in the wall, but super clean with a very friendly staff.",
        "From a business traveler perspective, I have nothing bad to say about this Avis at the Phoenix Airport.  As others have indicated in their reviews, it is worth becoming Avis Preferred so you can have a car ready and assigned to you when you arrived.  \\n\\nMy party got off the shuttle, walked to the board to see where our car was, found the car and checked out when we left the lot.  Piece of cake and only took a couple minutes.",

The staff were unbelievably rude and it is always insanely crowded.  If you can manage the Sonora Quest in Glendale takes appointments and has always been great.",
        "Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved!

Large facility. \\n\\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms.",

        "Hungover on Sunday and your man is dragging you out to watching Football? I pretend to hate going to watch football but $4 bloody marys on Sunday I will hoot and holler alllll day! They are delish and the bartender taught me a drinking game to give me a reason to want to watch the game.",
        "This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs.",
        "The garlic chicken is awesome. And the pad Thai is about the best ever.  We checked out the reviews and was do happy we did.",
        "The worst customer service experience. Unfortunately for them, my expectations for customer service are a bit higher seeing that this is a higher end Vegas spot...but damn. Just really upsetting.",
        "Anyone who rates this restaurant anything less than 5 stars needs to go to the doctor and get their brain checked. The customer service and food is always on point and they are so consistent. Time and time again my wife and I go and we never have one complaint. They have an amazing formula going on there and if they remain on too of their game, they will be there for a long time.",
        "Love this place, but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation?  The website and voice message give conflicting hours/days of operation?  Ultimately, the kitchen closes by 6 pm--super tough to make dinner plans!",
        "Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it, I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad, however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads you'd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(",
        "The Scottsdale location has since closed down and there is now one in the Park West area in Glendale.  I have been there 3 different times now and it has gone downhill each time.  I'm not sure what it is, but the quality of the food is not as good and I've walked away for the last time not wanting to go back.  It's just not the same as it was a few years ago.",
        "Solid burrito spot at very reasonable prices, especially at happy hour ($1 tacos and $2 beers...felt like being back in college). The potato tacos are indeed quite interesting, so be sure to try at least one. Service was above average. Overall, nothing blew me away but I absolutely left full and happy and with hardly a dent in my wallet.",
        "The last few times I have been there the staff has been horrible. The don't pay attention and then when I ask again for them to add something I already asked for they give an attitude. The food isn't that great to have to deal with staff that don't care. Chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food Mexican in Oakland.",

        "Worst experience ever! Why does a hookah bar open at noon but won't serve hookah until 4 pm? Four employees here chatting and on their phones neglecting to help or even acknowledge other patrons. It's the end of December and their heaters outside don't work? Have been here for 45 minutes and not checked on once by any employee at all. Worst customer service experience in all of Vegas.",
        "This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.",
        "Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.",

        "of all the empanadas i tried (i got the after 10pm 6 for $9 deal), the only one that really didn't work for me was the pizza pepperoni one.  Pepperoni is meant to be eaten as garnish, not as a main ingredient.\\n\\nAnd yes, i ate all 6 in one sitting -- partly because i hadn't eaten all day and because my hotel room didn't have a microwave.",

As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion.",

        "Never go here! I was denied being sold alcohol because they assumed I had been drinking because I mentioned that I had just left a club, where I had gone to line dance.  Please keep in mind it was 10:00PM on a Saturday night, they wouldn't even sell me fruit!!!!",

        "Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest.",
        "Based on Yelp reviews we stopped by and checked this spot out. The portions were big and the food was cooked to protection. The service was spectacular or I would have given it 5 starts. Our drinks were empty half of our breakfast and it took them 10 minutes to cash us out. I would go again to try something else on the menu for sure.",
        "Closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am... We saw people inside and the waiters saw us, but ignored us. \\n\\nChange your closing time to 2am so people won't be trying to come at 2:15am to a closed establishment.",

Totally professional and courteous. Very reasonable price!!! AAA+++ rating!!!",

It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",

When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",

Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",

I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",

The blueberry pancakes tasted like they were reheated in the microwave and dry, the bacon was burnt, refried and full of grease and my plastic cup of water had brown stuff stuck at the bottom. This is my first and last time here.",
        "Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!",

Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!  Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House.\\n\\nWayne Gorsek",

        "Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty.

        "I am disgusted that I succumbed to eating here, but I was starving and there was no place for me to grab food until I landed in Austin. Unfortunately, Sbarro happened to be the first restaurant that I saw after I landed in Charlotte. I ordered a slice of pizza, a spinach roll, and a water. I left $16 poorer and queasy.

One of my top three club choices while in Vegas.",

        "Great place to spend an anniversary! They really treat you well. The service was top notch. Fried Calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce. I had the Fillet which was great. My wife had the Butterfish and loved it. The Hawaiian martinis are delicious. Would definitely recommend it.",

        "This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself.",
        "I've done a few haunted tours and this was one of the best. A 3 hour tour around Vegas is worth the $50. Seeing where Tupac was shot, stopping to see where some pioneers were murdered and the all the hotel horror stories were great. The seance was cheesy but it was still entertaining. That and the people who thought it was real. C'mon people. It's worth the time and money if you like this type of entertainment.",
        "Good dumplings, though I wouldn't say they're the best ever. We enjoyed boiled, fried and soup dumplings. If you're looking for good and don't want to dent your wallet, this is the place. I'd suggest the owner try to keep the place a bit more clean... Just getting the grime off the windows/doors could improve the overall eating experience for patrons.",

        "Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk.",

It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.",

        "Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.",

Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",

        "The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",

        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",
        "Excellent service. Noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent. Very nice staff and decent prices considering the location.  I don't think I would come back again but I am glad that I tried it.",
        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",

        "Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am.",

        "Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly",
        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty.",
        "This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT!",
        "I love this bar, it's my favorite in Vegas. The vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud. I love the art on the walls, the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture. Christina and Pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out. The cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly! Try the burning bush, it's smokey and delicious!",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "Very good, excellent sides, tasty food.",
        "Rescued my 1962 Skylark Convertible, and took excellent car and concern for it. Rick (the tow truck driver) was great! Glad to find a quick, courteous, tow company....Since I probably will be needed their services quite a bit with this beauty! Thanks Guys!",
        "The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "Excellent selection of pastries, including chocolate almond croissants.  \\n\\nBoth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio creme/paste (delicious!)\\n\\nThere is a Lafleur nearby, in case anyone wants poutine before or after...",
        "The Food and service was excellent. I left feeling highly satisfied and will absolutely be coming here again to fulfill sushi cravings. I especially recommend the calamari.",
        "Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.",
        "Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7.75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price.",
        "all of their food are good and healthy.except for the shrimp. i love this place.recommended for everyone to try them out.",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service.",
        "Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "Went a while back for my birthday with four friends.... Great place for group because you can try more items.  So we tried virtually every app, the egg was the best and fries were okay when compared to the egg.  Elk ribs were outstanding and grits below I still dream about.  Wine was plentiful. Desserts were good but over shadowed by the rest of the meals highlights!",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Just opened, I will give them them the benefit of the doubt cause there other counterpart on charleston, not as good service could be better, layout is nice, ordered the burger, fries where great burger was burnt on the outside despite ordering med well, either they over used a blow torch or didn't clean the stove.",
        "Great new frozen yogurt spot! There is a lot of choices here! you make your own selection of yogurt and choose from a wide variety of toppings.  The seating  area had some fancy space cadet chairs but not enough chairs and tables for the amount of customers.  Over all Oh Yogurt was a very clean and inviting place to enjoy a cool treat!  I would recommend to others  to try and I would definitely return.",
        "We dined at Grotto last Sunday for lunch and, like our last visit, it did not disappoint.  \\n\\nWe had the Lobster Bisque and Spaghetti & Meatballs.\\nBoth were good.  \\n\\nThe grilled Chicken and Marinara sandwich is also delicious too. Try it if you come here. You won't regret it. \\n\\nThey also have good salads. \\n\\nAnother excellent visit.",
        "I went there last night, cruising around on Parc looking for a place to get a quick pint. I was happy to discover this place! The inside was nice with couches and candles. Pool table. TVS all around, I noticed the terrasse had neon lights too great for summer time will probably go back then. \\n\\noverall fun time!",
        "Solid 4 stars. Good atmosphere, great walking distance to everything, decent parking , fries are amazing, menu has something for everyone. A bit pricey. Sometimes understaffed which causes slow service. But all and all a great place and had nothing but good times.",
        "Such a great place for date night!  Being from the midwest and always around lakes and rivers, this place was a great find in the middle of the desert.  Such a romantic, relaxing setting lakeside.  Great wine selection and good food.  My fiance and I go there quite a bit.  Only one time did my steak not turn out the best.  Other than that, service is great and food/wine is excellent.",
        "EXCELLENT service (A+). Very good food (A). Expensive",
        "Absolutely enjoyed the dinner I had here.   Service was excellent and I have some very good memories from the dinner here.  A true pleasure and enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.",
        "$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms.",
        "Excellent food. Excellent service. Comfortable family restaurant. Highly recommend even if you have never tried Korean food before.",
        "I was so disappointed , Bobby Flay should revisit this place , this food did not live up to the hype. Fries too salty, my medium burger\\nWas more medium well . Too pricey for the \\nLack of quality . Go down the block to Gordon Ramsey's .",
        "Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "Great place to spend an anniversary! They really treat you well. The service was top notch. Fried Calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce. I had the Fillet which was great. My wife had the Butterfish and loved it. The Hawaiian martinis are delicious. Would definitely recommend it.",
        "Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.",
        "Really good margaritas.  Their food isn't anything special.  I am particularly critical because I am capable of making my own Mexican food that is way better than this place.  I would say their food is more Americanized Mexican food than true Mexican food.  Their salsa tastes like tomato sauce from the can.  Their happy hour is pretty good though.  I tend just to stick to that menu along with the delicious margaritas.",
        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",
        "I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special. There was no TV, period on our 5 hour flight from NY. All the kids in the plane were going nuts. The seats are very cramped and small. The plane seemed very old. \\n\\nGo Delta, if you have kids.",
        "I prefer wildflower, but recently had their grilled cheese and tomato soup and it was delicious!!  Will be back for that combo!",
        "Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "Food was excellent! A must stop when in Casa Grande. Florentine omelet outstanding! We will return.",
        "I went to Ground Control for the first time last night and I was unimpressed. The food was pretty good but the service stinks. They need some mature staff who can take care of their patrons, not the young kids playing kissy face with their girlfriend at the bar.  The cheeseboard for $14.00 was less than impressive with a couple of slices of cheese and a few nuts and dates. I think I will pass next time.",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",

Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "Tiffany was excellent! my review is soo super late but she really took care of my nails! She did the crystals on them and everything I was so thrilled and felt totally VIP when she took care of me immediately. I have never felt so un-rushed or pushed into anything in my life! Ask for Tiffany She is AMAZING!!",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "Open 11am-9pm. Greek guys doing white broccoli & white shrimp pizzas with buffalo wings, hot & cold subs, calzones, stromboli's, ziti, lasagna, chic parm, spaghetti. Free limited delivery",
        "I tried the lunch buffet here a few weeks ago, and the food was pretty good.  We discovered the buffet on our last day in Vegas, after some horrible Studio Cafe experiences.  The flat daily rate seems like an excellent deal when you consider what you pay for food in Vegas.  The seating area was freezing for some reason, but our waitress was great.  She noticed that we were shivering and suggested coffee/tea, and she kept them refilled.",
        "In Ceasars Palace at 4 am and nothing within walking distance, so we ended up here. I ended up getting the Chilli Cheese Fries. $8 NOT well spent. Small amount and the same quality as Weinerschnitzel... no joke!\\n\\nWill most likely pass this up next time. I should have spent my $8 on a slot machine....",
        "Stoles it! I got the coconut shrimp which was amazing. The shrimp is huge! And I had the lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich which was awesome. However, the fries that went with it were average.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "Have to give this place five stars.  Menu is great, value is great but the cook Jose is the best.  Great customer service, really knows how to treat a customer.  He gave me a sample of the Greek fries yesterday and they are out-of-this-world good!",
        "\\\"Tourist trap\\\" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more.",
        "This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special.",
        "Oh my gosh!  Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome.  Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked.",
        "I wouldn't go to this hotel. I went to Las Vegas many many times. Check out my pictures! I go to the best and worst hotels! This hotel is 2 thumbs down!",

        "They have so much in their store It sometimes takes a while to get through it. From Kid items (pokemon etc) to very adult themed items in the back. They are located at the Galleria Mall upstairs near the food court\\nVery friendly and helpful staff. I found a Minion Iphone case there and LOVE it!!!",
        "We love \\\"In and Out\\\" burgers & fries. Great milkshakes too.  When we want a quick burger, this is the place for it! \\n\\nYou can see the fries are made right there before they are cooked so you know they haven't been sitting around half the day. \\n\\nSimple menu, just a few choices, and delicious! Always a good choice for a quick meal on the go.",
        "Kate and I recently held our wedding at the Orpheum (ceremony and all) and it was fantastic. The service, the food, the setting were all something special. \\n\\nHats off to an excellent event coordinator, a helpful bar staff and some very tasty scallops (even if I was too busy to actually eat one).",
        "One of the best local places, they serve big and juicy pieces! And not to mention their fries! They might be a bit thin but they're really good and taste fresh.",
        "So... it's a neighborhood place - nothing more, nothing less.  The service all depends on how busy they are - if they are slow, you can expect good service. If they are busy, not so much.  BUT - I love their chicken wings and fries! Any time I have a craving for chicken wings, I end up here!",
        "Better than you average burger place, and a real blast from the midwest.  If you are in surprise, you have a choice that is off the beaten path now!  Enjoy!\\n\\nGood burgers, good shakes, fresh fries.  Yeah, it's good for a repeat visit!",
        "Reasonably priced and delicious this is THE dumpling house of China-town!\\n\\nLarge variety, and always savory - definitely worth the stop. You can also make your own dipping sauce from the traditional ingredients at the table.\\n\\nYou have every meat option - veggy, shrimp, pork, beef etc",

        "Sitting at the bar is always my favorite spot. Great TVs and they are always on some good sporting event. Sliders are tasty, fries are the way they should be and drink pours can be generous depending on who's bartending.\\n\\nThe patio is a nice little spot but can get a bit smoke filled depending on the night of the week. But they do have plenty of heaters out there so that is definitely a bonus!",
        "Killer place in Mesa to get your munch on with your furry friends!\\nThe patio rawks (love the misters), and they allow smoking outside (yay!) - deal with it! Mitch's Mushroom served with sweet potato fries is the sammie of my dreams, and the bar kicks out a mean snakebite!!\\n\\nThanks guys, we'll see you soon!",

DO NOT EAT HERE!!",

Super good and not chewy like most I've had. Their new patio is really nice and looking forward to the cold nights when they have the fireplace going.",

Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "The store here is laid out very well.  It is more of a custom baby store, but has quality items at all diffrent prices.  Some of them my husband and I were sticker shocked, but with having our third baby nine years after the last lots has changed.  The staff here was very helpful and we will be registering for some of our items for the baby shower.",

        "We had lunch here on a Monday. The place was not busy at all. The food was far from spectacular. We used points from the players card to pay for our buffet. Thank goodness because the  food was horrendous. I would never pay for this buffet with my own money. The service was great other than that this buffet just like the establishment its built-in,is on a downward spiral into.the toilet.",
        "I concur with several other customers commenting on the owner. We frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner, that was it for us.  Unpleasant and Rude is an understatment. It's not the way we want to spend a nice evening.",

        "Really good fried catfish!  I was not really fond of catfish until I tried Jamburrito's way of serving it. The jambalaya rice makes the perfect accompaniment for the crunchy delight. The people serving the food are very friendly and the total experience definitely makes Food Truck Fridays a weekly event to look forward to.",

The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation.  So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about.  Because of the rudness.",
        "Tried it for the first time tonight and the service was fast and portion size generous.\\n\\nOrdered the steak and broccoli with brown rice. The steak was tasty but a bit grizzly and fatty. My wife had the chicken which was much better.\\n\\nBroccoli was good but the rice was mushy. W",

        "Went for lunch, the food was okay, chicken kabbob were salty and broiled. The pita had 4 medium pieces of chicken and lots of  lettuce, and pickle with the yogurt sauce. I had hoped for better flavor and more meat (protein). Back to Sabas or Persian Room for lunch.",
        "A good Starbucks.  There is always a line at this one due to it's location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly.  Today I had a salted camel mocha.  It was pretty amazing.\\n\\nThis location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days.",

        "I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \\\"Wilmar\\\") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out.",
        "Hotel rooms are pretty gross. Carpets are so dirty that our feet got black. When we first checked in, there were stains on our bed sheets and pillows. GROSS. I guess you can say that you get what you pay for.. Cheap hotel. At least there was a mini fridge.\\n\\nBuffet was awesome though!",
        "qualified vets and techs with a lot of patience to talk to patient owners but it is well known that Banner is very revenue focused and not necessarily suggest things that are not needed but if you took your pet to a private practice you would get just as good care and pay less.",
        "Good enough for us to go back when we're feeling lazy but not good enough to rave about it.\\n\\nIt's fast, convenient and decent.\\n\\nAnd impossible to take a piss in. Seriously. 1 stall for like, 40-70 customers. I swear every time I need to take a leak or wash my hands, someone's in there--writing a novel on the crapper or something . . .",
        "My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!",
        "I dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur. I recently stayed here and it was great. Everything was clean, nice flat screen tv, walk in shower. Got upgraded for free too. :)\\n\\nThe pool was off the hook!",
        "This is a convenient place to meet and eat. I had a business meeting over lunch which worked out well since the restaurant seems to drown out some of the casino noise and the ambient music. I had the chicken quesadilla which tasted good except for the guacamole which was horrible. The portion was a tad on the small side but it is considered an appetizer and reasonably priced.",
        "My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back.",
        "The cinnapies are sooo yum!  And their $5 pizzas are great for last minute potlucks.  Every time I've ordered from them my pizza was always fresh and generous with toppings.  If I had to mention a downside it's that they don't take Discover and I like when business take all forms of payment.  But that still isn't enough to mark them down.",
        "The guy working there was nice.\\nTheir food is not great at all.\\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.",
        "basicaly, you get what you pay for.\\ni had this the night before we left and i made four bathroom trips on the way home.",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "Pros:comfortable bed, Great price 31per night, location, high energy casino, free parking. \\n\\nCons: dirty bathroom with leaking faucet, rooms on Fremont side very loud. AC is loud, our room was basic with no chair to sit in.",
        "I really discount tire for their prices and warranties, but one thing I can't stand is how they scraped my lip on my new wheels when they installed the new tire. Of course they denied it...what to do, ugh.",

        "I like almost everything about LVAC except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while I'm trying to relax in the jacuzzi. I don't like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer.  Note: It was not during the cleaning hours that is posted.",
        "Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!",
        "This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful service, clean rooms, and interesting lay-outs. Not really sure how I feel about the bathroom situation, but the waterfall shower was really nice.",
        "fantasies of you are inspiring me to finish my phd proposal that will be the only hope of our reunion. \\n\\nplease don't change. except maybe you could get more tables. and do delivery. and revamp the toilets. \\n\\nbut nothing else.\\n\\n if i don't get accepted, or funding,  i will be your US rep and together we will conquer a country of generally mediocre indian food. \\nxxoo",
        "We've some stuff on the menu - burgers, a wrap, onion rings, fries, etc- and it was all fairly mediorce, but reasonably priced at around 7-8 bucks for dinner.  \\n\\nBut hey - the hot wings here are amazing.  No complaints.  They're perfect.  ORDER THE WINGS!!!",
        "Performance art with amplified tuned percussion, humor, audience participation, and yes, toilet paper.\\n\\nThis was a great event, a private showing of BMG sponsored by my company. The three principals, backed by drum-heavy band, bring their unique take on the human condition, the Internet, love, and plumbing, with hilarious results.\\n\\nTo respond to a previous reviewer, they plucked two of my colleagues out of the audience to interact with them. Very entertaining!",
        "Veggie Sandwich (Something like that) \\n\\nThe cooked mushroom portabella, red and green peppers, with onion and cheese was well worth it. The bread was super soft and the sandwich was perfectly sized. \\n\\nThis place is located on the first floor of the city center alllll the way at the end of the mall away from the main entrance.",
        "Apparently they don't staff appropriately for a Saturday night.  we didn't wait long to be seated but waited for the server.  The bathrooms were terrible wikth no toilet paper  except for entire roll in the toilet and towels all over the floor.  The server Leo was good.  The water also tasted bad like there was mold somewhere.",
        "Great place with even better staff. They're very helpful, patient and caring. There have never been any surprise bills and they're very gentle with the animals. I only see Dr. Whitcraft because she is so personable, kind and terrific at her job. I highly recommend this place, especially compared to other vets I've been to throughout the years.",
        "Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \\nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.",
        "The bar area was nice, but the dining area was off-putting. That side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades. The fresh bread was burnt and tough. The table was a bit crumby. I ordered the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, which admittedly was bland. The server and service were great.",
        "This restaurant is a master of understatement. From the outside and Upon entering, it doesn't look like much. \\nAs it should be, the truth is in the food  food....best beef and broccoli I've ever had.  We are regulars now.  Simply outstanding",
        "Gross is the first word that comes to mind.  The ladies room was covered in piss and toilet tissue. If that's not indication enough of how classy that place is maybe the soft porn or rude crowd that will push u to get a mini beer for a nickle would be. Really weird vibe there too. I'll pass and go next door and pay the 4 extra dollars for a full sized beer that I don't have to wait in line for.",
        "Used my Groupon for a massage and blow out. Massage was very relaxing. Shampoo and style were ok. Stylist was a little slow to style my hair, as he was using a blow dryer that wasn't very powerful. Overall a pleasant experience. Friendly staff and central location. I will book a repeat appointment.",
        "I have not had a single bad visit to this barbershop. The staff has been always nice, friendly, and provides a good haircut.\\n\\nI usually get the Triple Play which is a cut, shampoo and hot towel. Not a bad place to go if you're looking for a new barbershop.",
        "Brand new. Stumbled into it Excellent execution on all plates. Roasted halibut, roasted broccoli soup, nice choices for charcuterie plate and interesting texture for shrimp and grits. Highly recommended.",
        "we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.",
        "I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.",
        "I miss Dim Sum. New Orleans is not a place to live if it's a staple in your diet. I loved the hustle and bustle of Asian familes and the harried staff. The dumplings themselves were good, the tea piping hot, but wished we had ordered some broccoli.\\n\\nThat is all.",
        "I've taken my two Shih Tzu's to this clinic a couple of times for shots and ear treatment. The vets are knowledgeable and have never tried to convince me that my dogs have any extra illnesses they don't really have. The clinic used to be a little pricey but now that they are priced the same as any other vet clinic in town it's a good clean convenient place to take your pet if you are in Southern Highlands.",
        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "Clean inside with pretty decor.  Never busy with great service.  \\n\\nThe Tableside Guacamole is devine.  Yummmm......\\nThe Margarita Cheesecake is a straight up hangover cure.\\nThe Cancun sauce is unique and delicioso!\\n\\nNot the best mexican food I've ever had, but it has a small soft spot in my heart.",
        "AWESOME. \\n\\nAnd sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. \\n\\nBut really everything is good here.",
        "I'm a huge fondue fan and I really enjoyed Shabu Fondue.  I've been to The Melting Pot and preferred the ambiance of Shabu Fondue better.  It's more quaint and cozy.  The food was delicious; the sauces were flavorful and I was full!  It's a bit pricey, however, it was worth it.",
        "Things have gone downhill since the early reviews of this property.  The elevator has numerous scuff marks, dings and lots of wear and tear marks.  The welcome mats in the lobby are dirty.  Our room had several suspicious stains on the black out curtain and bathroom wall.  The supposedly non-smoking floor was smoky as is the common areas.  The staff are friendly, which saved the resort from a 2 star rating.",
        "We picked up some combination pad Thai on our way home tonight and it was super disappointing. No peanuts, no lime, bright orange sauce, almost no bean sprouts, lukewarm. My boyfriend isn't crazy about spice so we went with a level 2 heat which was more like what I would expect from a 3+ level and was definitely pushing his limits. Definitely won't be going back.",
        "It's gets the job done. The \\\"Deluxe\\\" bit might be a bit of a stretch as the facility appears to have had better days. This will never be confused with a main stream or premium range hotel but I am not sure anyone would be surprised by that. I would not stay here with the family for a vacation but for a bed and a shower while working out of town it suffices.",
        "Been here a few times while in town.  Usually get the typical Thai dishes when I come here w friends.  The papya salad, lad nah seafood, half an order of duck and chinese broccoli.  Looking forward to trying other things on their menu, but so far...so yummy!",
        "Had a really great time here, tons of people and really good music, and the thing I remember MOST clearly was that there was NO line for the women's bathroom! Maybe girls are just lower maintenance or more considerate than in NYC, but I was so impressed with the lack of a bathroom line.",
        "As good as a real Starbucks. Good service, good products, reasonable prices, and nice staff.\\n\\nREMEMBER... This is NOT a real Starbucks. This is a franchised store owned and operated by Target. So things may occasionally be different than in a corporate owned store. This includes training of the baristas. They don't go through typical Starbucks training, so they won't always know the entire menu and how to properly prepare things.",
        "This is among my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The Queen Charlotte roll is my personal favourite. It does get extremely crowded at nights so If you're at the bar, ask for Stephanie. She is a solid bar tender who will make you smashing special cocktails that aren't on the menu. Enjoy. \\n\\nBut be prepared to buy more than 3 tapas per person or you will spend a lot and leave hungry."

Everything was delicious. The wine list was different than most. Very nice.",

Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's.",
        "This place was surprisingly way better than I thought. Came at 10:40 ish. Paid for breakfast, but got breakfast and lunch. Came in during the transition. Their beef sausage ( different from the breakfast sausage) was very tasty. Also really like their flank steak. The Mexican rice was also very good. You seriously cannot beat the price",
        "What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.

I have a soy intolerance, and they brought me crab in a soy wrapper.  We didn't figure this out until I was a couple of bites in.  Then they didn't discount my meal.  The waiter took forever even though the place was pretty empty.  Lame all around.",

Their prices match the quality; the only off note is that if they want to charge Teuscher like prices I expect something a bit more upscale than a cheap bag when I pay $10 for 4 truffles. Please if you're selling high end truffles wrap them with the respect they deserve and that I have paid for.",
        "I have no complaints, other than the prices are higher than other places. The location is convenient and the cashiers are always friendly.  I was reading other reviews about the cleanliness of the store, and it's strange because I've lived here a month now and haven't had any of those experiences.",

You physically must be in his or her narrow line of sight and directly in front of their register or else in their world you physically do not exist.  In other words very poor customer service.",
        "Longest wait times ever. Nobody is in the office and have been sitting here for 2 hours. Never again. Go somewhere else.",
        "The food is pretty expensive for what it is: generic steam table Chinese food. I would recommend other Chinese food in the plaza less you're in a hurry.",
        "I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!",
        "Not as good as Molly Brannigan's, but a decent pub none the less.",
        "I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \\n\\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \\n\\nNegative: very limited selection.",
        "I cannot recommend this place more. My dog absolutely loves his new food. \\nOn top of it being super healthy for him, the owner and staff are really helpful and friendly. Their dog food and their attitude, actually made me feel like they love my dog, as much as I do!",
        "Small, easy to navigate, a good middle-class hotel. Stayed in the \\\"Playboy Tower\\\" which was nice. Within walking distance to the Gold Coast and Rio, but not much else. Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM.",
        "My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \\nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",
        "Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave",
        "Prociutto was yummy.\\n\\nVeal meatballs were awesome.\\n\\nGood starters but the reason we came here was for the pizza.  Never again...\\n\\nPizza - took one bite and that was it - yuk - among the worst ever - it was crunchy - like biting into a cracker.  \\n\\nBatali should be ashamed of himself.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!",
        "This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself.",
        "Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.",
        "Kokimo's was way better. There were about six hostesses and 10 waiters plus 10 more bussers. Waiters seemed way too freaked out to spend time at the table. The did not seem confident. Almost like they would get in trouble if they talked too much to the table.  Atmosphere looks like a lower dollar BBQ joint. Need more options besides a regular steak I can get back home for less than half the price.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "Kouign-amann. Check.\\nCanel\\u00e9. Check.\\nPeet's Coffee. Check.\\nCroque Madame? Oh yeah.\\nPain au chocolat. The bomb!\\n\\nNow Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery has a contender on the west. Worth the drive!",
        "I went to Ground Control for the first time last night and I was unimpressed. The food was pretty good but the service stinks. They need some mature staff who can take care of their patrons, not the young kids playing kissy face with their girlfriend at the bar.  The cheeseboard for $14.00 was less than impressive with a couple of slices of cheese and a few nuts and dates. I think I will pass next time.",
        "went to the Dayclub wasn't impressed. May have been how awesome Encore was the day before but none the less seemed nowhere near on the same level. daybeds, cabana's were very cramped barely had room to walk between rows of beds.",
        "I would rated minus 5 if i could, stay away from this place specially this person named Kimberly she is awful she chopped my hair off way far from what i've asked to at the end there was no haircut and she told me: \\\"the less you wash your hair, the better it will look\\\" i needed it dirty!! I SHOULD'VE CUT MY HAIR AT HOME CAUSE THIS PLACE AIN'T WORTH IT!",
        "Mattie's is a great addition to Charlotte.  It is comfortable and unpretentious.  It is not a yuppie diner wanna-be, which is good.  The portions are generous, the prices reasonable, and the value good.  I have eaten at Mattie's several times and have never been disappointed.",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory",
        "Was lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \\n\\nFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.",
        "This place has the best breakfast burrito in town! They're a little on the pricey side but well worth the money and on some days (Sunday?) they're a dollar off. Everyone who has ever taken my order has been polite and friendly. I want to try something else on the menu but the breakfast burrito is too good to pass up!  Love this place!",
        "I live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag @gangplank.\\n\\nI got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarian,but they were delicious. its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying.",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "It's Walgreens.  Generally they are all the same.  However, I will say the pharmacy staff here is very good.  They are helpful, friendly, and seem to be efficient in filling prescriptions.  They also are good answering questions about non-prescription products.\\n\\nThere are probably two other Walgreens convenient to either my home or office, and another two or three CVS.  This tends to be my first choice of them all.",
        "I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.",
        "Had the worse nail experience here. I asked for a nail trim and a fill. The woman cut off some of my skin said \\\"sorry\\\" and passed me off to someone else. Wtf?! Definitely not going back!",
        "Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "I waited for an hour to get my hair highlighted I had previously called and said I was coming in and then it was my turn to be next and they took somebody else in front of me and told me to wait another 20 minutes.",
        "HORRIBLE customer service!! After 10 years of my 5 children seeing them and hoping each time they might be more friendly or accommodating, but continuing because we live so close. We are done with you Mesa Pediatrics! We are paying customers with great insurance, you could care less. We are taking our money elsewhere!",
        "If I could give it less I would....This place is terrible.  My husband has only seen his doctor twice in the 12 years we have been here, the billing dept is a joke (good luck trying to get a hold of someone to speak with),  They have had their chance and now we are outta here.  Look elsewhere if you want good care with good staff.  There has to be better providers that this place.",
        "Lunch in Las Vegas does not have the power element like most other cities as everyone is on vacation! Milo's on the other hand has become my favorite new lunch restaurant to eat and be seen. With an amazing prefix menu this is the spot to be.",
        "Been here several times now and it's still just ok. Folks I work with like to frequesnt this place, but I am just not as enthusiastic as they are. \\nGrilled cheese is pretty good, but I'll be darned if I am \\\"going out to eat\\\" just to have grilled cheese!\\n\\nCall me crazy!",
        "Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.",
        "Visit1 heaters on patio don't work\\n\\nVisit 2 they are out of most beers\\n\\nVisit 3 they can't lower the sunshades\\n\\nSeriously? I'm sorry I kept giving them a chance. Never had a waiter or waitress that had a clue.\\n\\nPT's around the corner has half price booze from 4-7 and midnight to 4. Go there and save the aggravation",
        "Ok so I came back here the other day, for nostalgia more than anything, and I realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else. Don't get my wrong, I LOVE Baguette Express, but it's always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing, particularly in this branch!!",
        "the food was good and had very nice presentation.\\nwe had: \\nmezza combo\\nsteak and hummus\\nfried kebbeh\\nmakanek\\nfalafel\\nmossaka\\n\\nits more expensive than what i thought it would be.",
        "I had the Full Montagu, and yea its a sandwich. Nothing more and nothing less. Not special that's for sure. It was a busy afternoon there, and the line was very long which I actually liked because I thought  that maybe it was going to be awesome. When I started on the sandwich I felt extremely disappointed. There was a little buzz about the place so maybe my expectations were too high.",
        "So... it's a neighborhood place - nothing more, nothing less.  The service all depends on how busy they are - if they are slow, you can expect good service. If they are busy, not so much.  BUT - I love their chicken wings and fries! Any time I have a craving for chicken wings, I end up here!",
        "I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.",
        "Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.",
        "It's pretty pricey for things you'd think would be pretty cheap. I went there looking for birthday presents for a friend, and they didn't have what I needed, and the cashier got kinda pushy about me buying something else... I just wanted to leave. Was uncomfortable. I won't be back.",
        "The Caribe Cafe is in the Mirage Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas, and is your standard coffee shop, no more no less.  Standard fare, reasonably good service.\\n\\nI sat at the counter as a single recently, but I wouldn't advise it.  There is less service there, and they kind of forget about you.",
        "We stopped in after Showstoppers. They tried to charge us $10.00 cover even though we were there before 9:00pm time when they start charging and if we were buying drinks. Then the young lady say even Mr. Wynn pays, I'm sorry I don't care I'm not going to pay you $10.00 cover to buy a bottle of wine. So I took my business else where. Thank you",
        "We used to love this place but inexplicably they have eliminated waiters and turned it into a take out spot. It's one of the Most bizarre setups I have ever experienced. People are walking all over the place so you can't really relax, no bartender anymore, extremely understaffed. We will most likely never return.\\n\\nI saw the Slots turned off,, so maybe lost the gaming license?",

        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.",
        "The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed.",
        "I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",
        "Pork chops, curry soup, are tasty \\n\\nLo Mai Gai is good but has no lap cheung\\n\\nDofu pi juan is vegetarian",
        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.",
        "I love this place, the custard is always cold and delicious. I love the smell of freshly cooked waffle cone.  I love the atmosphere music the decor on the wall it really takes you back to more wholesome time.  So another Saturday another custard Run.",

        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty.",
        "This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT!",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "I ordered the eggs rancheros. The tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick. My friend had the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.",
        "Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",

While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",

        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks.

The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.",
        "Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get.",

I ordered the combo with two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon it was great! The wait staff is super courteous and attentive. Will be going back many times to this place!",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Just opened, I will give them them the benefit of the doubt cause there other counterpart on charleston, not as good service could be better, layout is nice, ordered the burger, fries where great burger was burnt on the outside despite ordering med well, either they over used a blow torch or didn't clean the stove.",
        "This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes.",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "We dined at Grotto last Sunday for lunch and, like our last visit, it did not disappoint.  \\n\\nWe had the Lobster Bisque and Spaghetti & Meatballs.\\nBoth were good.  \\n\\nThe grilled Chicken and Marinara sandwich is also delicious too. Try it if you come here. You won't regret it. \\n\\nThey also have good salads. \\n\\nAnother excellent visit.",

        "I was so disappointed , Bobby Flay should revisit this place , this food did not live up to the hype. Fries too salty, my medium burger\\nWas more medium well . Too pricey for the \\nLack of quality . Go down the block to Gordon Ramsey's .",
        "Breakfast was decidedly underwhelming. My husband's bfast sandwich was average at best and my egg burrito was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were burned, almost black, and tough. How do u make eggs tough??? Service also horrible. The guy serving us was not familiar with the menu, we had to flag him down for more coffee, and would someone please buy him a personality?!",
        "I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \\n\\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \\n\\nNegative: very limited selection.",

        "I had the Lobster Burger! Yes, I said Lobster Burger. It was PHENOMENAL! OMG! I have never had anything like it. THE best thing I have ever put in my mouth!\\nThe service was impeccable! This place rocks! Open 24/7 too!",
        "Not bad. Decent sushi. The duck bim bi bap was good. Extra half star for having Orion at the bar. View of the waterfall is cool if you're into that sort of thing.",
        "The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.",
        "Their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly !",
        "I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me.",
        "Perfect Pho! Stock was seasoned just right; the meat and noodle was just the right portion. Nothing you could ask for more.",
        "It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. \\n\\nMeh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food.",
        "Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.",
        "The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.",
        "i work at the hospital at sunrise and im always here to eat there great food! good variety of food, but my favorite is there philly cheesteak special! i always order from then and i like how they deliver too becuase sometimes i cant make it there so i order to go! deliveries are so much easir for me tho! love it",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding. \\n\\nI love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-)\\nThey also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen. \\n\\nThe parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes.",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",
        "Burger Bar is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Anytime I have friends or family in town, I pick them up and we head to eat at the Burger Bar so I can order my favorite Kobe Beef on Whole Wheat Bun with coleslaw, BBQ sauce, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese and fat fries. It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",
        "Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular.",
        "I would rated minus 5 if i could, stay away from this place specially this person named Kimberly she is awful she chopped my hair off way far from what i've asked to at the end there was no haircut and she told me: \\\"the less you wash your hair, the better it will look\\\" i needed it dirty!! I SHOULD'VE CUT MY HAIR AT HOME CAUSE THIS PLACE AIN'T WORTH IT!",
        "Had curry noodles with chicken, as spicy as they make it. It was pretty spicy, but I wasn't crying and sweating from my forehead like a few of the other good pad Thai places around Vegas. Chicken and vegetables were fresh and simple. I will have this again for sure. Eat it with chop sticks,everything just falls off the fork. \\nVery nice atmosphere, very friendly, extremely attentive staff.",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "Open 11am-9pm. Greek guys doing white broccoli & white shrimp pizzas with buffalo wings, hot & cold subs, calzones, stromboli's, ziti, lasagna, chic parm, spaghetti. Free limited delivery",
        "CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!",
        "I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting.",
        "Best wings ever (besides Zipps Golden wings...)! We order a bucket of hot to go and can't wait to get them home! Other things we've tried aren't the greatest, except for the fried calamari. Super good and not chewy like most I've had. Their new patio is really nice and looking forward to the cold nights when they have the fireplace going.",
        "Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!",
        "Went for dinner and drinks. Great patio, really good drinks,  and we all really enjoyed our meals. The crowd and vibe were fun. We will definitely be back. Check out the house made turkey burger and nightly drink specials.",
        "The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!",
        "Food was fair, heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didn't like their noodles. Service was good, for the quality it was expensive.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "This place runs out of certain donuts at a certain time. I was told it takes 3 hours to make chocolate munchkins.",
        "The Piemaker boasts that it's sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry. \\nDouble pastry?!?!?!\\nToo perfect.",
        "Our experience at the Fig Tree was truly enjoyable. Visiting from out of town, we were happily surprised to stumble upon it. The atmosphere was homey, welcoming with a touch of Southern hospitality. We started out with a great bottle of Meritage and fresh bread with rosemary infused olive oil. We had a great pasta and an awesome filet mignon with yummy fingerling potatoes. We highly recommend this restaurant.",
        "Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "I like this place for the most part but don't make the mistake of offering the eggs benidict it is sourer.  The poor lemon in it",
        "Why wait in line every weekend to go to the popular brunch joint right around the corner when you can go to this place? The scrambled eggs, homemade tortillas, plantains, avocado, beans, feta, sour cream special is a true breakfast of champions in the best kinds of ways, super fresh and cheap to top it all. My main breakfast spot these days.",
        "This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special."

        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "Both fortunately and unfortunately, this location makes a great and consistent coffee. However, time is money and these folks are chatty and sloooow!\\n\\nI sat in the drive thru last week (after ordering one Vento coffee ) for 17 minutes. There were only 2 cars in front of me... Seriously?",
        "Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",
        "i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",
        "OK for a quick breakfast. No one can mess up a nova lox sandwich. Bottomless drinks are a plus.",
        "Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!",
        "I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit.",
        "I wish I could put negative stars on here.... Went to get a oil changed and tire rotation when I got my car back the radio didn't work, all the electric had been tripped and I now need a serious alignment. The manager basically told me to bad so sad it's not their problem, they were busy and they had no time to fix their mistakes.  They didn't even offer to fix another day or anything just that it was my problem now.",
        "I am so happy that people love Picazzo's  This restaurant has been a part of my life for the past 6 years.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the service, food and atmosphere!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a wonderful patio to meet your friends on for a drink-- look no further than Picazzo's in Tempe!!!!",
        "Its a laid back place for sure, with all the plusses and minuses that go with that. Crackerjack super-fast service? Dont count on it. Dusty in the corners. Seems to fly on auto pilot a lot. In any case, its the bar I go to the most... so go figure. Nothing quite like it.",
        "This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!",
        "I usually get the sirloin,  but the fish dishes aren't bad either.  Steak is always nicely cooked,  along with the delicious side dishes.  Desserts are delicious, save some room for them. The tally nice thing is that they are consistent!",
        "Apparently if your standing under the lit \\\"order here\\\" sign and no one is at the register, the employee standing at the register over from the sign is not allowed to help you... You physically must be in his or her narrow line of sight and directly in front of their register or else in their world you physically do not exist.  In other words very poor customer service.",
        "Beer was not that cold the 1st time I went here.  Thes time it was cold, so I was happy.  The food and atmosphere are okay.  Some of the table stools are wobbly, which is annoying.  They have an outdoor patio that allows smoking, which my husband appreciates.  Unfortunately, the most memorable thing about this",
        "This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\\n\\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.",
        "The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3:23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4:00 AM. \\nLike many who come here for conventions - this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work - and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.",
        "Contacted by a marketing person from Ellis Island for more info about the incident. I responded...then never heard another word. Really think they do not care about customer service. Clearly enough people show up for the cheap food. Whatever...just sad.",

        "I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha",
        "Kokimo's was way better. There were about six hostesses and 10 waiters plus 10 more bussers. Waiters seemed way too freaked out to spend time at the table. The did not seem confident. Almost like they would get in trouble if they talked too much to the table.  Atmosphere looks like a lower dollar BBQ joint. Need more options besides a regular steak I can get back home for less than half the price.",

Overall happy w the service and repair they do give a 90 day warranty which is nice. Wish it was a little more professional but overall they did the job i needed. The shop is right off Mill ave so you can park in the meter and run in and drop off and pick up",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "Ultimate hot dog spot! I've had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and they're all crazy good! I'm usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself. Plus Bird songs Mexi Cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me!",

They just did the most amazing alterations job on a bridesmaid dress and are super reasonable.

Definitely will use them again!",

        "After seeing all the other Cirque shows in Vegas first, I was a little let down by Mystere.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a good show.  It just can't compare side by side to \\\"O\\\" or \\\"Ka\\\" with their higher tech stages.  The performers were great but halfway through the show I got tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  See this first...then see the other shows.",
        "There's not much I can say about this place that hasn't already been said so I'll just sum it up: It is amazing!! \\nNever judge a book by it's cover because from the outside I was having second thoughts for a moment, but it changed quickly. They have outstanding customer service, offering me complimentary iced tea while waiting, and the large acai bowl did not disappoint either!\\nI will be back!",
        "What the heck is wrong with all the five star reviewers? Went here last night. No sense of hygiene. Un-eaten bread is reused for next table. Hot sauce is put on with a brush directly onto eaten food without being washed or changed between tables. Yuck. Lost my appetite here.",
        "Sitting at the bar is always my favorite spot. Great TVs and they are always on some good sporting event. Sliders are tasty, fries are the way they should be and drink pours can be generous depending on who's bartending.\\n\\nThe patio is a nice little spot but can get a bit smoke filled depending on the night of the week. But they do have plenty of heaters out there so that is definitely a bonus!",
        "I didn't eat here, just walked in and tried to sit down at lunch time. The people were nasty so we walked out. Plus there's a $50 minimum per person. Gotta give it to 'em - they went all the way with the ridiculous minimum.",
        "This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail",
        "This is our quick go to.  i love the variety of single slice choices.  All of the food is always consistent and good.  I have had better Italian, however it's reasonably priced.  It is always busy and sometime hectic.  I would definitely recommend.  Much better than the other choices in the area.",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.",

        "Nice people and good service, it's just the food was subpar.  If you love airplane food, you'll love this place.  If you like good subs, this is probably not the best place for you.  Another negative is the pricing - it seems to be way higher than Subway, which has better subs than Blimpie.",
        "I called in an order after leaving a near by tanning salon. I arrived earlier than my estimated pick up time by 15 minutes. Instead of making me wait, they got my order together right away. Very fast, friendly service. \\nI've never been disappointed with their food. They are consistent with the quality and quantity every single time I eat here.",
        "A New Orleans haven in Phoenix! This restaurant/cafe has the perfect combination of French/New Orleanian food & beverage options. The French press here is some of my favorite coffee in town. Plus a great wine selection & authentic French food offerings. I'd read about this place and finally got to try it- what a treat! Well worth the drive, and I'll definitely be returning.",
        "Wow apparently these people are illiterate or self entitled or both! \\\"Small dogs\\\" sign clearly means St. Bernards and pit bulls don't belong inside. My small terrier gets really intimidated around big dogs and starts barking at them. So we left after 5 min. A bad accident is waiting to happen any minute here. Today half of about 40 dogs were too large to be inside. If you love your dog don't take him here.",
        "This is my third cirque show(mystere and zarkana), this was by far the best!! Seriously, air acrobats plus diving.... Absolutely amazing. Very expensive, but definitely worth the price.  Great vegas show!",
        "Love the concept of pilates meets yoga in the 90 minute class! I workout often but this class gave me a good sore all over. A couple negatives...I rented a mat and it kind of smelled bad. There was no music during the regular yoga class and I prefer tunes to go with my poses.",
        "This is just a bad chain bar.  Went on three different occassions with large parties over the course of a year and service was the most consistently unfriendly we have seen.  We all love courntry music and the quality of the music was a big plus but the far below average food and uppity wait staff just make it a not enjoyable environment.  Would not go back.",
        "Beautiful new Thai restaurant. Great atmosphere, excellent service and absolutely delicious food.  The 2 course lunch special is a great deal.  I will definitely put Gaati on my short list of favorite restaurants!  Plus the owners ROCK =))",
        "The bar was okay (satisfactory drink menu), but the dining room made me feel like I was in a coffin.  I had a pizza and a salad, both of which did the job in satiating my hunger, but neither of which I'd write home about.  In fact, I don't think I'd take my parents here, and they love mediocre dining.  I won't be back.",
        "A great downtown location, an appropriately-sized setup in a beautiful building, a clean, modern aesthetic. \\n\\nGiant was obviously well-funded. That's about it for the positives. \\n\\nIf you like bitter, overpriced, pre-sweetened (!!!) 'coffee' served by an obnoxious, barely-legal hipster sporting a cardigan in July, this place is for you.",
        "This place is OK.  Shoes must be taken off before you come inside.  Staff was really, really friendly and that was nice.\\n\\n\\nRooms are RIGHT by the kitchen which can be annoying/noisy.  Also gets FREEZING in here at night.",
        "The fun atmosphere and nice staff, plus a great room with an awesome view, can't make up for food poisoning from the America restaurant.  I didn't want to spend my vacation in the bathroom.  We will try a different hotel next time we go to Las Vegas.",
        "I tried this restaurant with a friend and I had the spaghetti.  It was delicious.  The waitress was great too.  The prices weren't high either.  All I have to say about this restaurant is positive.  I will be going back for sure and you would be wise to check it out for yourself.  We went around 5:30 p.m. and it was very quiet.\\n\\nS. Cooper",
        "I wasn't even in the restaurant for a full 10 minutes before I was denied service because my cousin went to use the restroom when we entered. Apparently you can't use the restroom here folks without the manager accusing you of being too drunk when in fact she wasn't even drinking. The manager had a major condescending attitude. FYI it wasn't even busy yesterday and they denied service to some very generous travelers. I didn't even know what to say. Awful.",
        "This is a great place to go on a cold winter day. The food is both spicy and warm. First I usually get a bowl of what seems to be miso soup, which is complimentary with your meal. They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people",
        "Best oyster shooters!  Get the lobster bisque!\\nService and view were amazing!\\nWaiter went out of his way to retrieve my Rewards Card!  Complimentary champagne since we were celebrating two birthdays!  We had a great time and a lovely meal!",
        "I am not a big fan of pizzas but I wanted to give this place a try. With an excellent concept of customizing your pizza with a number of ways(way more than traditional) and have it on a fresh, thin bread, this place is a must try for everyone. The 11 inch pizza was perfect for lunch and worth every penny of the 7.95 I spent on it.",
        "Nice looking place but it's servers are very consistent with FORGETTING our orders. I can understand if they forgot to put one order in, but multiple times? After ordering dessert, I felt uneasy and regurgitated what I have eaten.. It must have been the baked salmon. I'm never coming back here again. If I could give this place a negative star, I would.",
        "I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!",
        "Avoid!! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters :( Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted (to pay for). Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",
        "Never had a bad meal here. Love their Singapore noodles plus service is great",
        "I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left.  \\n\\nOn a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food.",
        "Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \\nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.",
        "I took my cat and Chihuahua there for a bath and brush to get all the loose hair off. Did and excellent job! Plus the toenails were cut nice and short and ears where cleaned very good! My cat had extremely dirty ears and does not like her ears cleaned. I was very happy with the grooming!!",
        "had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!",
        "My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!",
        "Had dinner on 05/02/08; we had no reservations and just walked in, which made it a plus. The service was great, the decor and atmosphere made it fun, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesome..definately recommend these two!",
        "The most fantastic thing about this quaint nieghborhood bar is they are CONSISTANTLY giving back to the community. They.never fail to give of their time and money when a cause or person is in need! Please.support this wonderful establishment, you will get the best service, drinks and food all the while knowing you are helping a great company's efforts to give back!",
        "Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.",
        "Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face\\n :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope \\nThis information is useful :)",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "This place is all right. Check in was a breeze (maybe because I came at 4am!). Yes it's old and outdated, but there's free wi-fi, so that's a plus for me. :)",
        "If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner.",
        "Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!",
        "Not a whole lot of ambiance going on which I was used to at Box.  A very medical office type environment but the staff is really friendly.  Love the Australian wax for its gentleness on my skin but wasn't thrilled with the results.  Wasn't as thorough as other waxes.",
        "I have eaten there about 5 times. The food was good, service was good also. The atmosphere is a family type, a little bit of noise, but not annoying. So all in all it was good for me and my family. It seems to be a good place to have a large group go for dinner and not have a 2 hr. wait.",
        "Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!",
        "Wait staff was friendly only thing positive about the place.  Walked in the floor was sticky.  Went to open the menu and the menu pages were stuck together.   I ordered oysters on the half she'll and they came out warm.  We left after that was not interested in finding out what the rest of the food was going to be like.\\n\\nWARM OYSTERS!!! Make some one deathly ill!!!",
        "Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color..",
        "I had the Bronzed Catfish and Grits with pork sausage.   It was a wonderful, taste popping meal.   The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients.   This place is directly south of the premium outlets.   We stayed parked and walked to Rick's Restorations, which is across the rail tracks from their parking lot.   This restaurant was featured on DDD.",
        "Alright so as a fan of Bosa Donuts, and seeing all the positive reviews of this place, I just had to try it.\\n\\nWent along and got a dozen variety of delicious donuts.  Each donut I've had so far was just scrumptious and delightful.  Hard to compare to Bosa's right now since I don't have any of theirs, but Good Donuts is definitely amazing and well worth it.",
        "This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",
        "This is most certainly NOT a Fry's Marketplace. Fry's Marketplaces sell all of the home goods, this one is definitely not one. I just walked in and all of the floors are ripped up, tres sanitary! Plus it's dingy and small. Blech!",
        "If you like Joe's Crab Shack ... then maybe this is your funky Medina.\\n\\nNoisy cramped environment with Chinese quality seafood served in a plastic bag that you open and eat directly off the table with your fingers. \\n\\nYa... Hoo!\\n\\nIts just not my ... bag!",
        "had to get a cashiers check.  There were three people behind hte tellers counter but only one window open.  the line of three people essentially was begging for them to open the other two.  The tellers were just chitchatting and that's what upset me.  I had to get a cashiers check with they did with ease, and actually waved the 8 dollar fee, so that was a plus that made it an even A-ok in my book.",
        "Garden Grille & Bar  is simply the most consistent gourmet restaurant I have ever been to. I am been going there for at least 5 years and have neve had anything but a fabulous experience.",
        "This Irish bar is pretty typical for a casino.  I.E. there isn't much Irish to it.  But it does have a decent selection of beers.  Sometimes they bring in very weird bands or groups to play music.  I would say it would be worth stopping by and grabbing a beer.  Plus you can keep the glass.",
        "Just had my haircut an hour ago and already two strangers have complimented the cut. Jason's work is the best in town.  He really understands how to make wavy, unruly hair look fabulous.  Plus, the scalp massage, complimentary coffee and hip setting makes one feel they are getting the star treatment.",
        "We had complimentary passes to The Buffet from our stay at Encore.  We decided to check this place out for brunch.  The food is pretty much on par for any sort of buffet in Las Vegas.  The one item that was missing was crab legs.  I will most likely not be back as I am not a big fan of buffets."

        "Expensive, small portions, mediocre food. Go somewhere else!",
        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!",
        "This is our \\\"go-to\\\" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door.",
        "The food is tasty, but pricey, huge portions. Service was just okay, even though there were no other customers, and despite the fact that I did state it was my first visit, the girl helping seemed annoyed that I had to think for a millisecond about what I wanted.",
        "Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever. Mon Ami Gabi=not such a good night. How do you say hell night in French? Enfer nuit? \\n\\nI think a name change is in order. Oh, and your staff is very French too. In attitude.",
        "I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza.",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions.

I will come back & bring friends.",
        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",

        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",

I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am.",
        "I always stop in here when I'm in Vegas.  It's always busy regardless if I arrive at 11:00am or 10:00pm.  That's how I know it's good.  Ordered tacos al pastor & carne asada.  Best tacos in Vegas as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",

Good spot to sit by the bar seats so you can people watch while you chill here. \\n\\nFriendly service.",
        "I love this bar, it's my favorite in Vegas. The vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud. I love the art on the walls, the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture. Christina and Pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out. The cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly! Try the burning bush, it's smokey and delicious!",

        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "This was our first stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",

I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",

Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!  Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House.\\n\\nWayne Gorsek",

        "This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion.

        "Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!",
        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",

P.S. staff is rude.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better).

Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",

        "I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz.

        "Grade: C-\\n\\nUmmm. Hmmm. Okay. Uhhhh. Huh. Right. What should I say? Yeah.",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "I would say this place has one of the better boba places I've tried in Vegas. They have a pretty good selection of milk teas and slushies and they have shaved ice! It's like a Tapioca Express but better because I actually like this place and I hate TapEx.",
        "The best deck in the burgh, for the gay bars anyway. Great bar though, the food has gotten better recently, and the drinks are always good. Its a good time, and a good place to hang out in the community. Very friendly staff and ownership. Who also really supports the community.",
        "Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",

        "Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!",
        "What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again",
        "CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "Best food in Vegas. All natural, fresh, healthy, and tasty!",
        "Wow, harsh reviews!\\n\\nI found the guy behind the counter helpful.  He steered me in the right direction and I got a meal I really enjoyed.   BBQ'd tilapia and Chicken Adobo were very tasty.",
        "we got in for free..it wa......\\n\\nso i started to write this review months ago and i never finished...\\nwell i am proud to announce that i have made table reservations for june..... so apperently i like this place!!!! cant wait to go and act a fool!!!",
        "It was around 6 pm dinner time and they were out of a lot of food.  I then decided to order something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu which is mostly breakfast sfuff.  I figure I can wait for them to cook something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu.  Well, the lady working said they weren't serving anything from that menu at that time.  Wtf????  Why do you have that on your menu then???  Get it together!!",
        "Ultimate hot dog spot! I've had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and they're all crazy good! I'm usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself. Plus Bird songs Mexi Cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me!"

        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "Thanks to Rollie & crew, I can now cross this item off my bucket list! Had a great time touring the Arizona countryside and experiencing the ride. They even got me involved with the setup of the balloon which also added another level of interest to the whole experience. Would very much recommend this company to anyone in the Phoenix/Glendale area!!",
        "Been back several times and I will say they have some pretty legit shakes. They are huge! I like the chocolate chip one. The banana split is yummy, too. \\n\\nI had the food once and was not impressed. Will not be doing that again. This rating is solely for their desserts as that's what I go back for now.",
        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",
        "Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.",
        "This place is awesome! We were visiting from hawaii and we got to meet Ramona and the staff... they were very friendly and the food was great. We all (4 )ordered different things and it was to die for. We don't have this kinds of stuff here in hawaii so it was a treat for us! We will be back here for sure next time... don't worry ramona, we will be sending you a postcard soon!",
        "I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum.",
        "You aint in Kansas anymore!  This show is alternates between amazing acrobatic feats, some clever humor, and downright vulgar.  Friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the show, but I'm only giving 4 stars due to uncomfortable seats.  Fortunately for us people seating next to (read on top of) us were really friendly and not too large.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever. Mon Ami Gabi=not such a good night. How do you say hell night in French? Enfer nuit? \\n\\nI think a name change is in order. Oh, and your staff is very French too. In attitude.",
        "You want to make an appointment at this place? Go ahead! It's another story that it doesn't matter when you show up, because you still get in the line. Fail!\\nPS - Some employees are super rude and would yell at you.",
        "I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza.",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.\\nWe will go back often!",
        "Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...",

        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! \\n\\nI loved the show! The performers are amazing!! & it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back.",
        "Pretty disappointing. Waited in line for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLow quality food.  Tough prime rib.\\n\\nSushi was disgusting. Very fishy.  Prepared in advance and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard. California roll and cucumber roll?  I thought this was a high end buffet. Where are the fish rolls?\\n\\nI've had comparable food at a Denny's.",
        "The b\\u00fan is what I always get and they do it perfectly. Ph\\u00f3 is not that special though. They often have lines in the evening and it's cash only (atm inside). All in all if you're looking for a cheap, family-oriented place that's also tasty go here!",
        "Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!",
        "This place has gone to shits !! The food sucks and the service is horrible ! It used to be good but now it's the worse.. Don't go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting.. Sorry to say",
        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",
        "fun joint, right on the strip you can people watch, get hammered, DJ booth coming soon right on the patio \\\"I heard\\\" this is a deff go to place during the summer!",
        "Calamari was ok, breaking was that crispy but overall it was good.  Ordered New York style because it was the special.  Not impressed with the crust. Usually the crust is nice and crispy.  This time it seemed like there was too much sauce because the crust was soaked and chewy.  Sauce and cheese were good.  Still hasn't swayed me. Metro is still totally worth it.",
        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",
        "Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE",
        "Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food.",
        "Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",
        "Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!",

        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",
        "Jodi is the best. I can't imagine going anywhere else now that I've found her! She is incredibly thorough with her cut and color and ensures that she understands exactly what you want. I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!",
        "meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain.",
        "You're greeted by the hot air and the sound of slot machines as soon as you step out of the airplane. You know that you're in Lost Wages!!! The shuttle system is quite good, and the shops are nice too. Checked baggage also arrives promptly.",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Please get courteous waitresses!  We dine there all the time in the evenings & those waitresses are kind & appear to be of Greek Nationality. Today we made the mistake & had lunch.  The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!",
        "Happy we have another bar in charlotte,  but have been there twice now and the wait for a drink does not make sense.  When you are paying a bartender $8 an hour and charging $8 dollars a drink do the math.  I wish you well, bit not sure I will go back.  Get it together guys.......",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!",
        "The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.",
        "Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.",
        "Most boring strip club in Phoenix metro. For typ Sat nite, Paid 13 bucks cover, yes 13! Why 13?  Then one bud light bottle cost 6.25 round that up to 7 for tip, then a lousy table dance for 10 bucks. I lost 30 bucks in 15 minutes. After that, I even rejected one girl cause she looked high on something and ugly with her eyes half opened. I am a local and I am never going back there again.",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "This garage is hit or miss.\\n\\nCompletely depends on what is going on (events etc...) Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\\n\\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!",
        "Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \\n\\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!",
        "Came here a few weeks ago with friends. Breakfast was good, tea was nice, atmosphere ok. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. I love the location and the interior is vintage and original. The outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather. Moderately priced.",
        "Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Visiting from CA and my fellow traveler recommended we stop in here to pick up a few things. Nice layout and good prices.  My only complaint is the bananas were green.  I appreciate that at home so they last longer, but when wanting to eat one now it kinda sucks.  Matt the cashier was very friendly and cool as was the bag boy.  Nice place...he said it's family owned and operated.  Like it better than Sprouts which they have in SoCal.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",
        "We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.  Happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with $3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps. My husband is a huge fan of the wings!",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "I think they changed the owner or something.  I used to like this place, but today i bought sweet and sour chicken, it smelled so weird.  Like something is just not right (old ingredients? or old rice?).  This is my first time writing a review online and this restaurant deserve my time so that i can warn everyone about this place.  Save your time and money, and maybe your health by avoiding this place.  It used to be a good restaurant, not anymore.",
        "my go-to hotel with my girls. been here so many times that i am sick of grand lux cafe. altho the food is good and it's open 24/7. the rooms are spacious, well priced and location is great. they have a coffee bean which is great (+2 stars). only (-1 star) is that wifi is not free.",
        "So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \\n\\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!",
        "I  get my hair done by Jessica Tobler. She does a great job at bleaching and coloring and has always made my hair feel so soft after going to her. She's great at cuts and often offers special promotion prices. Jess goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable while she's doing your hair and always leaves you looking fabulous. i would recommend her to all my friends.",
        "For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry.",
        "A dying breed, unfortunately. You wonder how long before B&N is gone. Hopefully not for a while. Nothing like the smell of bound paper and coffee. It's comforting. \\nEnjoy it while you can, tons of books, magazines, music and the experience of actually holding a book, physically flip through its pages, rather than electronically. Can't beat it",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!",
        "I think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers.  I thought the cashier was inattentive, and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customer's. The ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more.",
        "Very sad to say that the bar was sold to a slot parlor & will be closing before New Years. The staff was good & so was the food. To many stupid slot parlors in this town now!",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction",
        "I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \\\"Subway Effect\\\" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",
        "ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!",
        "While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.",
        "The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\\n\\nI can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?",
        "I do not fly Delta often, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and have no complaints.  All my flights along this trip were on time, and service was wonderful.",
        "They make cupcakes now! Gluten free, soy free, vegan cupcakes. I asked Ginger \\\"If there's no wheat or soy, what the frak are they made of?\\\" and she said \\\"Love.\\\" And you know what, based on how delicious those cupcakes are, I believe they just might be.",
        "Went here about a year and a half ago with my parents on one of our final nights in Phoenix and we weren't disappointed.  My sister went there a few nights beforehand and recommended it to us after she went there with some friends who live in the area.  I don't know what the new location is like, but would definitely go again if in the area.",
        "Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!",
        "One of the best massages I've had, well worth the charge.  Melissa provided a very professional massage.  I asked for a 90 minute deep tissue massage and she delivered a wonderful massage that got the kinks, knots and stiffness out of my body.. I'll be back and would highly recommend.",
        "My 1st time here. \\n\\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\\n\\nI'll be back for happy hour soon.",
        "Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it",
        "The Marvel Experience, more like I took your money and there is nothing you can do. Do not go, 4-D will never happen. You will never be immersed in the 3-D and 4-D. \\n\\nThe Marvel website promised a lot, LOL. If you go do not expect a lot. Don't expect anything except long lines.",
        "Two hours later, still waiting. Others checked in after me seen. Service has gone downhill in the past year. And new policy of holding debit card isn't the best. Harder to fight inaccurate charges",
        "Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7.75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price.",
        "Fantastic wraps and pizza that we all shared! \\nAwesome beer selection!\\nGreat service, I would defiantly come back soon.",
        "I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit."

        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.",
        "I had the Carnitas Burrito and it had no taste. I definitely know good tasting Carnitas and must echo the sentiments of that famous line in the 1988 VP Debate when I say \\\"You sir are not a good Carnitas Burrito\\\".",
        "This is the best show Ive ever seen.",
        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "We were staying at the Luxor and figured we would try the buffet. Big mistake...the food was gross, there was not much of a variety, and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night. \\n\\nThe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive.",
        "So happy this place opened up so close to home. \\nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\\nWe will definitely be back!",
        "Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure.",
        "Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "The crepes were very dry (overcooked), the mushrooms tasteless and unsliced.\\nThe crepes have no finesse.\\n\\nWhile the service was good, the food was pathetic.\\n\\nAvoid this place.",
        "Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever. Mon Ami Gabi=not such a good night. How do you say hell night in French? Enfer nuit? \\n\\nI think a name change is in order. Oh, and your staff is very French too. In attitude.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza.",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.\\nWe will go back often!",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "It was hot outside, but cool inside. We went for an AYCE lunch and enjoyed every bite. The service was fast and friendly. This is no non-sense eating establishment. Most of the clientele with the exception of yours truly were locals. The experience was good, presentation of the food was nice and everything was fresh. We will be back. I have the feeling that if you go for dinner you better plan on waiting cause this place is a local favorite.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",
        "Try it if you like e-Coli poisoning and a evening spent on or near the toilet. The Pozole has the taste and texture of a barbecued sock, and comes with a side of salmonella. In the interest of fairness the guacamole was good and the service was decent.",
        "Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.",
        "The b\\u00fan is what I always get and they do it perfectly. Ph\\u00f3 is not that special though. They often have lines in the evening and it's cash only (atm inside). All in all if you're looking for a cheap, family-oriented place that's also tasty go here!",
        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",
        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "it rocked!!! Their version of a BLT was out if this world from the bread to the avacado oh my. a might messy to EAT but well worth the post eats hand scrubbing",
        "Located inside Monte Carlo next to Dragon Noodles. They have a Sunday Red Sauce Dinner with 3 course dinner-salad, entree, dessert. It comes with free breadsticks and marinara sauce. The waiter was good on refills. Nice place to eat there for dinner.",
        "A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",
        "Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!",
        "We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel....",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "Solid Pita Jungle. All our food was fresh, fast, and good. A little bit of a wait on a Friday night, but not bad. Staff was fast, friendly, and courteous. Will definitely be back.",
        "So einen schlechten D\\u00f6ner hatte ich noch nie!\\nDie vorigen Bewertungen kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, sorry",
        "Staff - friendly\\n\\nOnsite urgent care - good. \\n\\nprescription filling ability - awful.  Don't have a prescription filled here. They either 1) don't receive it all or 2)  get it wrong.  Seriously.  Don't.  It's not worth the headaches.",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!",
        "Following a bad experience with another local Mazda dealership, I took my Mazda CX-5 here for service. There was no hassle getting my free oil change service which was included when I purchased the car. I've had bad experiences at a different local Mazda dealership, but the staff here were courteous and professional, and I have absolutely no complaints.\\n\\nThey've earned my future business, and I will certainly be back again.",
        "Please get courteous waitresses!  We dine there all the time in the evenings & those waitresses are kind & appear to be of Greek Nationality. Today we made the mistake & had lunch.  The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \\n\\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!",
        "Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "A go to for a good dinner.  We have been there twice and both times were awesome.  The service was always prompt and courteous.  I have made recommendations to people I know, and have always been thanked after the fact by those who have eaten there.",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",
        "Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "We stumbled in off the plane and had a tasty lunch. For 2 people - calamari a la plancha, xato salad, scallops in romesco sauce, white ceviche and raspberry tuna skewers - it was all good and beautifully presented. No drinks. $80 for a light lunch felt a bit steep.",
        "Why is it, there are 20 something registers but only 3 open? Every time I go there in the evening, there's always a line and I mean line as in 10-15 people in 2 lines. \\nAlso why the crap do I need to show my receipt when you just seen me walk from the register after paying for my items?",
        "One of my favorite \\\"cheap eats\\\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo",
        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "I love this place. Everytime I come to Scottsdale, I have to visit, a couple of times too  No matter what I try, I'm never disappointed, never!\\n\\nLast night I had the chimichanga (sp?) and it was delicious!  I felt it could have been shared but it made for a great lunch today.",
        "The food is good. I've  never had the sushi but Ive heard  it's very good. I only gave 3 stars bc the service is AWFUL   The manager is a pompous asshole,  Is annoyed at life And  doesn't care if you have a complaint. Acts like your disrupting his life if you have a concern. \\nI've eaten here and had a few good experiences but I've also has really awful experiences as well and haven't been back",
        "Excellent selection of pastries, including chocolate almond croissants.  \\n\\nBoth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio creme/paste (delicious!)\\n\\nThere is a Lafleur nearby, in case anyone wants poutine before or after...",
        "This place is fantastic.  The staff is extremely friendly, the food tastes authentic, and the prices are extremely good for what you get.  4.50 for a burrito with chips/salsa included...can't get much better than that.  I'd recommend trying the quesadilla's there. They make their own tortillas and it really is a one of a kind meal.",
        "Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction",
        "We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby,  Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it.  The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!",
        "I love Dean and Deluca...they always have the best sandwiches and salads!  When I arrived in town for Thanksgiving, it was the first place I visited.\\n\\nI love that you can visit and get a whole meal to go, eat lunch there, or go for a dessert and coffee.  It truly is all things for all people.\\n\\nI only wish we had one in Houston!",
        "It's the bar in the center of the casino.  Open 24 hours.  Bartenders were hit or miss.  The best ones were usually late at night showing why they got the better shift instead of the 7am shift.  \\n\\nCheck in on Foursquare at Pour 24 and then go down the escalators to Center Bar and snag your free jello shot! Bonus!",
        "Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour.",
        "Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "My 1st time here. \\n\\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\\n\\nI'll be back for happy hour soon.",
        "Went Wednesday night at 9 pm very busy and always good!",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.\\n\\nCibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts.",
        "Food is decent but not the best in Charlotte. Went with friends on Saturday night and it was so noisy I could barely hear my friends talking to me ACROSS THE TABLE. The bar area was worse than the dining room. Lots of families go with their children.I suggest going during the week.  There are better Italian places in our fair city with a lot less noise and confusion. That being said the foodis OK.",
        "We ate here last\\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.",
        "Best doughnuts = Krispy Kreme! And this location has wonderful friendly staff as well as being clean and well kept.",
        "It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service.",
        "I am so happy that people love Picazzo's  This restaurant has been a part of my life for the past 6 years.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the service, food and atmosphere!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a wonderful patio to meet your friends on for a drink-- look no further than Picazzo's in Tempe!!!!",
        "Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty. \\nService was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do. \\nThere was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown. \\nWould never be going back....",
        "Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get.",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  \\n\\nI ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "Great food, great service, great atmostphere. What more can you ask? Equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal.",
        "Picked up a Pizza tonight and it was terrible. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I made sure to be there at that time.  The box seemed warm but not hot.  I didn't really think about it though until after I tasted it.  For almost $18 this should of at least been hot. The crust was chewy not crisp at all.  Not worth it.",
        "Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.",
        "Went on a weekend morning more than a year ago. It says something that I still remember the details of my visit. They were just unorganized. Possibly overwhelmed.

A 12pk will run you $11 and some change.\\n\\nThere's always plenty of parking.\\nStore his huge, bright and very clean.\\nWide variety of alcohol. More than what any one human needs.\\nStaff is very friendly.",
        "Maybe because I'm use to NY Steakhouses but I was disappointed. \\nI was with a party of 10 for lunch. Lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked. \\n\\nWhere's the porterhouse steaks???\\n\\nWine was good but little expensive, even for Vegas.",
        "This is the best place for burritos in Charlotte.  Particularly recommend the vegetarian burrito.  Great atmosphere, cool staff and music, easily accessible from downtown, Dilworth, and South End.  As good as any burritos I've had in cities known for their burrito- like food, including LA.",
        "Went to Joes this morning! First off after about 3 mins of sitting down i got to meet Joe and shake is hand! He is awesome and was sold on the place after that. I ordered the combo with two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon it was great! The wait staff is super courteous and attentive. Will be going back many times to this place!",
        "Pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below.  Pomo in Scottsdale is better and closer.  Probably won't go back. \\n\\nThe staff were not friendly and it wasn't even that busy - we went last night.  To much success has gone to there heads.",
        "went for restaruant week.\\nabsolutely fantastic.\\nthe filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.\\nthe creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. \\nthe staff are very professional and friendly. \\natmosphere compliements the entire experience.\\ni hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!",
        "I've only been here at night so far, and last night was only my second time. It's a great small town bar, everyone knows each other and they are all very friendly. If you find yourself in Maricopa at night and you're looking for the night scene this is it.",
        "Checked this place out for the first time.  With the exception of it being very hot inside (had all the doors open no A/C) it was a really for a social area.  We didn't have food, only drinks so I can't comment on the food.",

        "Good drinks one day. Great drinks another. Watered down drinks the 3rd day. That's why it got 3 stars. Wish I could have given it more. If go back though.",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "Casino is decent, pool is fun, rooms due for revamp.. The suite I was in had water damage from hottub in room with furniture peeling apart.  When I called the front desk they said all the rooms were like that. ;o(",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",
        "Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!",
        "Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks.",
        "A bit overpriced but good, not great. This place can be a lot of fun with large frozen drinks. It is a bit dark and loud, even during the day. A big minus, hold on to your hats, they charge $4.95 for chips and salsa!! For $4.95 this salsa better cure the common cold. But if this is your thing worth a stop. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "this place is a solid 3 for me.  \\n\\nThe casino is ok.\\nthe buffeet is better than ok (carnival buffet)\\nthe spa is blah (yeah, it rhymes)\\nthe rooms are ok\\nthe beds are BAD.  \\n\\nbut for $200 for 3 nights (holiday weekend), there isn't much room to really complain.  They treated me right.",
        "This place is horrible. Not only was I promised front line access but free drinks until 1am. They did not live up to any of it. I understand some things are out of peoples control but even the service was horrible. I am spending $15 a drink and they can't even say a thank you.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "We stumbled in off the plane and had a tasty lunch. For 2 people - calamari a la plancha, xato salad, scallops in romesco sauce, white ceviche and raspberry tuna skewers - it was all good and beautifully presented. No drinks. $80 for a light lunch felt a bit steep.",
        "my go-to hotel with my girls. been here so many times that i am sick of grand lux cafe. altho the food is good and it's open 24/7. the rooms are spacious, well priced and location is great. they have a coffee bean which is great (+2 stars). only (-1 star) is that wifi is not free.",
        "So much for that groupon. Tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone.",
        "OK for a quick breakfast. No one can mess up a nova lox sandwich. Bottomless drinks are a plus.",
        "I'm here a few times a week with my dog (the large dog side). Considering the craziness that takes place at most dog parks this one is pretty relaxed. Most of the dog owners here are pretty responsible here handling their dogs and cleaning up after them. It's super convenient and has a lot of space for all the large dogs.",
        "Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again.",
        "My 1st time here. \\n\\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\\n\\nI'll be back for happy hour soon.",
        "Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess.",
        "Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty.",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "Want a pint in a good bar on Leith Walk without any hassle?  Look no further than The Brass Monkey.\\n\\nThis pub has the feel that you're still in your own living room with comfy sofas that you'll have to peel yourself off but obviously it is a bar which means no washing up or cleaning the next day:)\\n\\nFriendly locals, comfy atmosphere and fairly cheap drinks - it'd be rude not to!",

        "Meh...it's cheap.  It's close to me.  It smells like the ocean in here (yes, fish....).  Cheap beers and drinks.  I might have had a couple of margaritas so this rating and review could be seriously flawed.  Worth a visit if you like the ocean and like to eat its inhabitants.",
        "Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \\n\\nThe Service is always good and friendly!",

        "Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!",
        "Expensive drinks at $15 each, not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it. Interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes, etc which added some fun.",
        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "Asado is a great hangout!  Good food and drinks.  The menu is full of very tasty choices. I like the feel of a Mexican Hacienda meets High Tech.  Cool place with good food!  I live in the area and felt like I was at my own Casa! Only thing missing was my pool!",
        "We just walked out of this establishment, after having been seated and left alone with menus for 10 minutes. Tables around us were already seated and they had no drinks.  We watched as the guy that seated us walked around filling water glasses. We decided to walk down to Pei Wei for carryout instead. \\n\\nTwo stars for the comfortable chairs though.",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Took my 15 month old there yesterday & he loved it! It's a very clean environment. My husband & I loved that there was a wide variety of activities & toys. Highly recommend this place and the price is $12 for an all day pass. Definitely will be returning",
        "The rooms are immaculate and unbelievably comfortable.  As the newest hotel on the strip, it lives up to its 5-Star backing.  Though, minus a star for the blood sucking black jack dealers downstairs.  They'll provide you with a steady dose of 14's, 15's and 16's.  I had one dealer call me her \\\"Bust it Baby\\\" and it's not because I look like Plies.",
        "We waited in line for about an hour (we got there around 11pm) and we were on the guest list, so there was a separate line. Girls got in for free while the guys had to pay $30. Walking in, it immediately reminded me of the clubs in LA! I would rather go to TAO, Marquee or XS and pay instead of this place. Why go 250 miles to club at a place like in LA?",
        "Came here for brunch before a Cardinals' game. Food was good and drinks very generous. Love that they have the bus to the games. Very nice that everyone could enjoy their time and nobody had to worry about driving.",
        "I've done a few haunted tours and this was one of the best. A 3 hour tour around Vegas is worth the $50. Seeing where Tupac was shot, stopping to see where some pioneers were murdered and the all the hotel horror stories were great. The seance was cheesy but it was still entertaining. That and the people who thought it was real. C'mon people. It's worth the time and money if you like this type of entertainment.",
        "The best deck in the burgh, for the gay bars anyway. Great bar though, the food has gotten better recently, and the drinks are always good. Its a good time, and a good place to hang out in the community. Very friendly staff and ownership. Who also really supports the community.",
        "Good dumplings, though I wouldn't say they're the best ever. We enjoyed boiled, fried and soup dumplings. If you're looking for good and don't want to dent your wallet, this is the place. I'd suggest the owner try to keep the place a bit more clean... Just getting the grime off the windows/doors could improve the overall eating experience for patrons.",
        "Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "I danced my ass off one night here!  Had a blast, but thank god I didn't have to pay for the drinks!  Somehow we got passed the cover at the door too.  The decor is really posh/random.  I don't remember much, but I know it didn't suck BUT I'm pretty sure that's because the people I was with were awesome... not the place.",
        "Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!",
        "went here last week with friends & it was amazing. had a gr8 time. great food, great drinks, excellent atmosphere, and awesome time. i would like to bring my husband here for date night.",

        "Dive bar? I guess, but the food, drinks, service and atmosphere are top notch. We ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger, Green Chile Mac & Cheese and Grilled Wings. All were DELICIOUS!!!! Bonus: they have shuffle board and Big Buck Hunter. This bar is legit. I plan on becoming a regular.",
        "Not impressed! The meats were very salty! No refills on soft drinks! The filet was really dry! We were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasn't comped? Extremely over priced!!!!! \\nNot worth your money! I went to the fiesta casino buffet and paid $6.99 and had better cuts of beef than here!!!!",
        "an oasis in the fratastic stretch known as carson street. while there are other legit (and respectable) bars on the southside, dee's has always been my favorite.\\n\\nthe drinks are cheap and the interior dingy but comfortable. i hang out here and pretend to miss my friends calls to meet them at town tavern.\\n\\ni can easily say this is the one bar i miss since moving to new york.",
        "Can I give zero stars? Hours of operation on the website and door say open at 8 am on Saturday. Well it is 9:15 am and I am standing outside with my husband and kids and the doors are locked. I saw a man inside so I knocked, he motioned to me that it would be a minute. 5 minutes later and no one has come to the door. First time coming here and it is now my last. What a shame.",
        "I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.",
        "Went for dinner and drinks. Great patio, really good drinks,  and we all really enjoyed our meals. The crowd and vibe were fun. We will definitely be back. Check out the house made turkey burger and nightly drink specials.",

        "Located in inside what appears to be the craziest indoor state fair like atmosphere of Circus Circus. That being said, once inside this meat oasis did the job. 3 of us stuffed ourselves silly with meat, sides and a few drinks for $200. Not so bad!  I competed in half ironman triathlon earlier that day and ate the whole ribeye and sides!",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "What a HORRIBLE experience!  The dance floor was like a moshpit with angry, ugly people.  The lines at the bar were 5+ deep and not moving anywhere.  The layout makes it impossible to get from one area to another.\\n\\nThe ONLY upside is that on the outdoor patio there is a great view of the fountains at Bellegio and of the eiffel tower.",
        "No!  Absolutely not!  Never, ever again!  I live in town and wanted to spend an evening downtown - walk around Fremont, get polluted, etc... and decided to get a room here.   This is NOT the place to stay! The casino floor is nice, the bars are decent, but unfortunately the rooms include FREE BED BUGS!  Took a cab home at 3am, and no... they would not refund the room cost.",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.",
        "terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.",
        "Great ambience. Great drinks. Great food. I love this place!",
        "liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda.",
        "I have been a few times and each time I am so happy I went. The food is unreal! I have tried the filet mignon, the salmon, the chicken scallopini all which melted in your mouth! They have everything from espresso drinks to top notch wine. I love the fact that is a Vegas family run establishment as well. Everyone is really so nice and cares about making you happy. Gotta love that it is a 24hr place to!",
        "You're looking for a place off the strip that's more relaxing in casual, this is your place. Five dollar blackjack tables all day; dealers very friendly. Great food selections at a very reasonable price. And the bowling alley that beats everyone! The rooms are average at best but they are clean. The staff was a little lacking.",
        "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Delicious food, yummy drinks, friendly staff.",
        "Fast and friendly service with good music. The malasada sunday was delicious! For drinks make sure you go for happy hour.",
        "Restaurants don't provide many gluten free or veggie options. Elevator nazis are rude. Wifi in rooms is incredibly slow. This place is stuck in 1998",
        "We stopped in after Showstoppers. They tried to charge us $10.00 cover even though we were there before 9:00pm time when they start charging and if we were buying drinks. Then the young lady say even Mr. Wynn pays, I'm sorry I don't care I'm not going to pay you $10.00 cover to buy a bottle of wine. So I took my business else where. Thank you",
        "Whomp, whomp!\\n\\nHaving been to other Vegas clubs and clubs in LA, this club was boring. \\nYes, they have a dance floor, tables, an outdoor patio, but why would I ever wait to get in here when I can go to a better club in Vegas. \\n\\nNot worth it!",
        "Family friendly activities!\\n\\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over.",
        "Nice coffee shop located close to the casino and guest elevators.  I stopped in the other day to get an Italian Soda as an afternoon pick me up.  The staff was friendly and the raspberry italian soda was delicious...although a little bit pricey at nearly $6.",
        "Great location close to the light-rail, lots of shade, and ample restrooms. However, the beer selection is terrible, and the food choices only slightly better. But let's face it, you're going anyway. Just grab a drink and brat before you get here.",
        "Dualing Piani....er, pianos! Need I say more? Not to busy early in the week but standing room only on weekends! Good drinks, no food, and the perfect place to go with a crowd. Get there early though, or your crowd will be standing most of the night.",
        "Food was great but the service was awful. We never even got refills on our drinks when we asked numerous times. Burger was the best part of the experience.",
        "Great little place. Drinks are a little pricey, but the bartenders are really fun to watch and the atmosphere is really great. We had alot of fun there.",
        "The Sunday brunch is . It's served butler style (they bring the plates to the table). All the plates are absolutely delicious. They have bottomless drinks for an extra $20. It's a great deal and different experience compared to other buffets. It's for sure worth  a try.",
        "Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?",
        "This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out.",
        "We used to go to this restaurant all the time and used to love it. They recently changed owners and this places is not the same. The menu is different.  The drinks are not as good. The origin of the wines are no longer shown on the wine list. The prices are much higher. The place has lost its Spanish ambiance.  The little touches such as the shot of liquor at the end of the meal has been discarded. Would not be back again.",
        "This place put the dirt in dirtbag. I hate saying bad things about a place but this bar captures all of the bad things about Tijuana (not Mexico, but the complicated border town with high crime and low American morals). The drinks are OK. This place caters to a younger uncultured crowd. I think I was just too old to be there and I'm in my mid thirties.",
        "I give this place 5 stars- not for the rooms but for the staff who were amazing- I left a bag with a laptop in it & staff/security - got home to southern cal before I realized it- The security staff- lost and found - hotel front desk- went above and beyond to locate it for me - thank you paris staff for exceptional service during a difficult day- great location- loved pool & DJ - fun for couples",
        "First time at this hotel and I love it here! Rooms are nice, hotel Is nice, no smoke smell, 24/7 Starbucks in lobby, got a cab right Away and most importantly they are pet friendly:)  walking distance to battistas yummy Italian restaurant.  Also walking distance to the strip.  Across the way from ballys hotel. Ill def stay here for future trips!",
        "Rooms are very nice and comfortable, staff is great! I was there for a meeting on a Sunday through Tuesday and the room literally shook all night from the XS night club music! I ate in 3 of their restaurant's that were good but stupid expensive, go down the road to Morton's for a superior steak for much less. The pool was nice but also way to pricey! $8 beer? $16 house maggie? WTF???",
        "Crazy lines, but good thing we have VIP passes to skip the madness.\\n\\nEvery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit! How can a girl in heels survive?\\n\\nGreat music though.",
        "After being seated by a young host who mumbled something about drinks then walked off to never come back then sitting for over 10 minutes and being ignored by no less than 7 different servers who walked by us, we walked out. Since we've been here twice before and the food is always just average (extremely boring menu) don't think we'll be back. What a shame since there are not too many breweries on this side of town.",
        "This casino is beautiful, inside and out. The canals are beautiful, with gondolas sweeping past the crowds, opera sounds piercing the air. Shopping is fantastic and the restaurants aim to please. Their  rooms are luxurious, even at the standard rates. I love their room bathrooms, especially the vanity area as it is actually made for comfort and convenience.",
        "Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?",
        "My all time favorite bar of all time. I frequent here at least 3-4 times a week. I have been doing that for about 4 years now. I will never stop coming here. Amazing drinks, food, beer selection, and most off all the staff! Keep it up Casey's.",
        "Super friendly staff, innovative locking mechanism that takes a noticeable effort to break this deterring break-ins and clean very very CLEAN.\\n\\nOnly a small annoyance but the keypads for the gate is inconveniently too far to the left causing you to either drive REALLY close to it or get out of your vehicle. Small trade for everything else.",
        "Horrible service ! Waiting 20 minutes for drinks.....missing bread sticks on one table . Had to ask for water....never got the breadsticks ....first round should have been on them for lack of efficient staff. Stay there all the time but won't be back to that restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "THE place to watch a sporting event in Vegas. Tons of seating and large TV's. My dream is to watch a big game here and rent a room with a pool table. Those rooms easily run a couple of thousand but one can dream. I love all the signed jerseys all over the place.",
        "Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time.",
        "There is nothing Grand Canyon-esque about the Grand Canyon Experience except the fake rock facade and the real birds that have taken up residence inside (I saw three).  This is a large tourist trap, I mean souvenir shop.  They have every kind of trinket including crystals, \\\"Indian\\\" jewelry, and myriad Las Vegas T-shirts.

        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company."

The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh.

To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",

        "I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it.",

If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",

Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "eh. meh.  the fog of the casino did not divert my attention from the price tag of these generic fusion versions of chinese food.  the dim sum was actually pretty good, but everything else was sort of greasy and white-ified.  oh also, restaurants that don't have windows toward the actual outside sort of creep me out.",
        "For a delivery style pizza restaurant, this place is top of the line. Every time I order form here I am impressed at the quality of food I am delivered. The pizza is much better than those main street chains and aside from the prices other places don't even compare.",
        "Disappointed that this place charged me $20/screen x 4 screens for set up and then decided to 'reclaim' my screens and asked that I pay the set-up fee AGAIN when I wanted to do another run a year later.\\n\\nService is friendly and professional, except for the principle of double charging set-up fees as described above. Hence I would not recommend them or use their printing services again.",
        "Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF.",

I would only suggest that they make this a Korean BBQ and do justice to their menu.",
        "Great place to have sushi the staff is very helpful. I realy like this place and do not understand why the bad reviews. If you do not like the sushi that is on the revolving belt then you can order from the menu. The food is price right and this is now my favorite place for lunch. They will be having alcohol they just need to apply for their license.",
        "Tao was so lame.  It was way too crowded, no room to dance or simply walk past.  I saw very few hot guys, mostly a bunch of corny ass dudes.  If you go, get extremely faded beforehand so you don't notice how lame it is when you walk in.  On the bright side, if you're a hot girl you'll get in free.",

        "There aren't that many places open for lunch at Mandalay, so I was surprised that this place wasn't more crowded.  There is nothing special about this place, but just a quick place to drop in and get something to eat.  The orange chicken was decent, but nothing worth coming back for.",

Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.\\n\\nFood is the same at both places.",
        "My tip: don't eat here.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is located inside Mandalay Bay, but is tucked away far enough that you're not inhaling cigarette smoke from the casinos.  The staff is very sweet.  These are the only positives.\\n\\nThe food is bland and really not good at all (we had 4 different dishes).  In fact, I believe I got a small bout of food poisioning.  :(",
        "If you like Asian fusion, you can easily find  better place to go then Fugu. Food is way expensive and ok at best. But the biggest let down is the service. WOW! The server almost dropped the plate in our table and didn't crack a smile. We had to ask twice for a fork and no one even came back after delivering the food. Not worth the money neither it's a friendly place.",

        "Some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the dim sum, both for the experience and the taste. Pork belly bites, brussel  sprout kimchi, meatballs, and steak tartare all great. The short rib cheddar biscuit is amazing. I may order two next time. Scallops were fantastic as well.",
        "Stopped going here with the management turnover and decision to go away from $1 pabst, low drink specials and 50% off sushi during happy hour.  \\n\\nIf I do go, all the sushi is fair game as good, also since there is some hawaii fusion with the food, you gotta get the fried rice.  Yom!  Yom!!",
        "If you are near downtown Las Vegas (or have a car to drive there) you must try these donuts.  The Lemon is filled with the same tart lemon as a lemon bar.  The Peach is filled with peach cream and topped with crumble.  Can't wait to try the chocolate.  Take these to friends, family or co-workers.  One note - the entrance is on Carson not Sixth.",
        "This is the best authentic Hawaiian BBQ in AZ.  Being from Hawaii it's as close to the local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii.  They need to have cucumber Kimchi on a much more regular basis though!  I tell the owners that all the time :).  Paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in Chandler.  I believe it's the only place in AZ that serves Meat Jun which is a staple of Hawaiian Korean BBQ.",
        "Super nice staff. Fast. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. Totally recommend! \\n\\nI live next door so it's difficult to find decent food around me since I don't want to live like a tourist all the time. I'm really glad I found this nice little deli.

My daughter and I had the chicken - Dry ... She had a \\\"creamed corn\\\" which means that the corn was in a \\\"biscuits and gravy sauce\\\".  My wife had the oriental chicken salad - it was ok.",
        "Home away from home. Great selection of Cigars, wrist watches and shaving products. Great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens. No membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge. Highly recommend Cigar King.",
        "If you want quality, quantity, and reasonable prices--don't go here.  The food could hardly be deemed within an authentic deli realm.  The service is poor, the offerings minute, and taste lacking (chicken soup too salty, sandwiches bland, and desserts hardly unique or fresh).\\n\\nEven though they are open 24 hours, you have 24 hours to find another venue.  This is a side-show at Circus Circus that is not worth attending.",

        "Nice market for healthy food and meats.  Their meat counter is great and be sure to try one of their many fresh sausages.  Very little fat in them.  Produce is good and prices lower than most super market chains.  They carry a vast selections of health food brands.",

The restaurant's interior is clean and inviting with TV screens.  Many business professionals make up the lunch time customer base.  I was just dissapointed with the carne asada.",
        "Came here with the BF last year with one of those VIP tickets.  TAO Beach itself is pretty small and packed.  There's nowhere to stand and trying to get drinks is horrendous.

        "Love Saffron Market, the Turkish coffee that they keep stocked is just amazing.  The pastries are just delicious always makes for a great little snack on my way back to central Phoenix.  The variety of products are really great and I always pick up something new I haven't tried just to try it.  Plus the store owner is very pleasant to deal with.  The store is always clean and the smells of all the spices are just amazing.",
        "I guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others. And what makes Mandalay Bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach. Kick back relax enjoy the water and the live DJ music.",
        "Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers.

        "Truly the best of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas. The show was awe inspiring not only for the acrobatics, but for the dancers, light show and graphics on various screens. And of course, Michael Jackson's music. At one point, Michael Jackson shows up to dance with the rest of the performers via hologram.",
        "Such a disappointment.  My wife and I are huge Beatles fans.  We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance.  This did not live up to expectation. There were three \\\"stunts\\\" that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that.  It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that.",
        "Love this place! I'm obsessed with burritos and these by far are amazing. They have many different options and they will make pretty much anything you want. The employees are very friendly and it seems to be a family-owned business. They offer many different options/sauces that you can't get at the chains. I've been several times and recommend trying this place out!",
        "I had a bul-gogi burrito with a chicken fusion taco. Everything was amazing. The thinly sliced beef was absolutely delicious. Loved the chicken on the fresh corn tortillas. i was also served complimentary chips and salsa and guac, which was awesome and unexpected. I all this... plus a bottle of water for 6.48. Unreal. Go here. You will not be disappointed.",
        "Ordered a Gilled Italian with \\\"NO Tomatoes\\\" to go as a suggestion from one of 8 people behind the counter. Didn't realize till I got home it was something totally different.  Food is just so-so.  I prefer paradise I think.",
        "Hmm.  Don't know anything about Peruvian food but it was just okay.  Had fried yucca, which was pretty good, also a slow cooked beef called Seco, and a shrimp dish.  We'll give it a second try but it was a little disappointing.  The place bills itself as Peruvian-Chinese but there were only a few items that were actually fusion dishes and the one I tried, a fried rice, was passable but nothing special.",
        "It's a PITA to get in if you're with all guys as they allow only 1:1 male:female ratio. This is great because women outnumber the guys, and there is nothing worse than going into a club and being surrounded by guys (unless that's your thing). It get extremely crowded even though there are 3 different areas of the club. Tao Beach has a great view. Overall a decent Vegas club.",
        "Amazing! Seriously amazing! From the amuse to the banana cream pie, everything was utterly delicious. We started with the  steak tartare and the crab and shrimp Louis. We then split the American Waygu ribeye and the lobster. Hands down the best meal ever!",
        "Great stuff!! I'm at work and the pizza guy was professional enough. The pizza itself was bomb, the little garlic bread is outstanding and even the marinera sauce was on point.

Was satisfied with the food, well when your drunk, anything is good to you, haha. Oh yah and this place is open 24 hrs.",

The 4 stars are really for the weekend brunch - all you can eat tapas that were interesting and (mostly) tasty.

        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.",
        "It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\\n\\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.",
        "Absolutely wonderful!  The food is amazing, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting. Would definitely recommend!",
        "I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu",
        "Great food, huge menu with a good selection. Tuesday's are 4 tacos for $10, great deal! Service was a little slow but everything else was very good",
        "Good drinks one day. Great drinks another. Watered down drinks the 3rd day. That's why it got 3 stars. Wish I could have given it more. If go back though.",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.",
        "This place is awesome! We were visiting from hawaii and we got to meet Ramona and the staff... they were very friendly and the food was great. We all (4 )ordered different things and it was to die for. We don't have this kinds of stuff here in hawaii so it was a treat for us! We will be back here for sure next time... don't worry ramona, we will be sending you a postcard soon!",
        "We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",
        "This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.  \\n\\nThe lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else.",
        "I have been seeing Dr. Johnnie Woodson for years.  He is always very nice and willing to talk to me about my condition at length.  The office has gotten so much better since new management has taken over.\\n\\nSometimes the wait is a bit longer than I would like but the Doctor is wortht the wait!",
        "Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure.",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "Used a Groupon yesterday and can only say that I had nothing negative to report and believe me where hair care is concerned I can be very critical. I had a phase I student who carried me through the process in a very professional manner. Final words -- Excellent Experience!!",
        "You aint in Kansas anymore!  This show is alternates between amazing acrobatic feats, some clever humor, and downright vulgar.  Friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the show, but I'm only giving 4 stars due to uncomfortable seats.  Fortunately for us people seating next to (read on top of) us were really friendly and not too large.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.\\nWe will go back often!",
        "True runner is wholey owned by dicks.  They will fit you for a pair of shoes properly and have a good selection of other running gear at reasonable prices.\\n\\nThey have both Saucony and Brooks lines in one place.  A real win for runners.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place.  Prices  for shoes were a little lower than I have seen elsewhere as well. Not much but 5-10/pair lower.",
        "Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...",
        "Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.",
        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "It was hot outside, but cool inside. We went for an AYCE lunch and enjoyed every bite. The service was fast and friendly. This is no non-sense eating establishment. Most of the clientele with the exception of yours truly were locals. The experience was good, presentation of the food was nice and everything was fresh. We will be back. I have the feeling that if you go for dinner you better plan on waiting cause this place is a local favorite.",
        "They have great bands that play here , but its too small of a venue to hear music.",
        "So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! \\n\\nI loved the show! The performers are amazing!! & it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",
        "We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.",
        "They have a great happy hour and the staff is awesome.",
        "Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up.",
        "I work right across the street from Antonio's Salon & Barber Shop and have been coming to him for over a year and a half!  He is absolutely fantastic.  He knows exactly what I like and the style of haircut I am picturing.  He is very professional with his work, reasonable with his prices, and gives a specialized haircut exactly to the T!  I rate him 5 stars.",
        "This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back.",
        "Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.",
        "The service is great and the food is even better. Doesn't need much more explaining than that!",
        "Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!",
        "Great beer. Great people.",
        "Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.",
        "Tried a few items and a flight of all of their craft brews.  Service was great as well as the food.  The manager came over and chatted us up and offered up a sample of their Octoberfest, which was really good as well.  I will definitely come back.\\n\\nTry the baby brats",
        "This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor.",
        "The peanut butter & jelly cake was served hot. So the peanut butter was runny and the cake was really dry & hard. You couldn't taste the jelly until you got into the center of the cake. Warm grape jelly isn't too great to eat. The latte tastes like any other latte.",
        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "Excellent service. Noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent. Very nice staff and decent prices considering the location.  I don't think I would come back again but I am glad that I tried it.",
        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "Both fortunately and unfortunately, this location makes a great and consistent coffee. However, time is money and these folks are chatty and sloooow!\\n\\nI sat in the drive thru last week (after ordering one Vento coffee ) for 17 minutes. There were only 2 cars in front of me... Seriously?",
        "Lunch on the patio also amazing.  Can't wait for happy hour.",
        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "Highly recommend! Never been to one of these places. Eric is a very nice and professional.  Great value 20.00 for hour massage, very peaceful, relaxing and clean. \\nTreat yourself and support local business!",
        "Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am.",
        "Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!",
        "Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.",
        "Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!",
        "Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food.",
        "Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",
        "Excellent smell but nothing outstanding. Good portion size.",
        "Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!",
        "Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks.",
        "The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.",
        "Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!",
        "We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel....",
        "Fresh food, great selection, For less than $10.00 a person. hard to beat.",
        "The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "The food is absolutely terrible at this Qdoba, or maybe it is all Qdoba's I don't know.  Either way, Qdoba does not stack up to Chipotle.  Better than Someburros?  Nope.  Better than Filliberto's?  Not quite.  Better than Taco Bell?  Doubtful.  Better than a Hot Pocket?  Yes, but what isn't?",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",
        "Jodi is the best. I can't imagine going anywhere else now that I've found her! She is incredibly thorough with her cut and color and ensures that she understands exactly what you want. I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!",
        "Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly",
        "meh is the perfect way to express how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here a whole bunch of times because I had a friend who LOVED it here. Everytime I've gone, I've never been very impressed with their food. Very average Italian food. not very original, nor particularly delicious. Not somewhere I would suggest, especially since there are far superior places in the same neighborhood.",
        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "Coach Christa and Suzie are awesome with the Novice Girls! They are great at keeping the kids' attention and helping them progress! They have helped her in her confidence and patience!",
        "If you want wine and have no idea what you're doing, ask for help. They truely know their stuff. All recommendations have been great!  They have wine classes and my favorite beer The Optimator!  Coupons sometimes in newspaper or online.",
        "Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty.",
        "Third time dining at Alessia's. As always the food was fantastic. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The owner John is down to earth and a professional. Pleasure speaking with him. Nice to enjoy great food and service in a family owned operation. Look forward to returning and passing word to friends about this gem in Mesa. Thanks again.",
        "Delicious!! :) got seats within five minutes of arriving. Service was top-notch and atmosphere was great!  Portions are huge, can definitely get one order for two people.\\n\\nNot an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates, family gatherings, or any special occasion :)",
        "Great shop,  friendly staff,  awesome work.   Ben was my artist and he gave me a baddass tattoo....   Will def come back when  I am back in Vegas!",
        "Pretty decent compared to other places in the area. A lot better than the one by Grand & Reems. I will come here again.",
        "This is our go-to SouthSide bar. Wings are great, burgers are excellent. Service is incredible - Jim, Erin, Kelly, Josh... All amazing people! The 2nd floor has held a bunch of our football drafts and we've rented for parties too. We love the BBT!",
        "A bit overpriced but good, not great. This place can be a lot of fun with large frozen drinks. It is a bit dark and loud, even during the day. A big minus, hold on to your hats, they charge $4.95 for chips and salsa!! For $4.95 this salsa better cure the common cold. But if this is your thing worth a stop. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Fantastic.  Only complaint was the late reservation.  Great ambiance. Great staff. Great menu. And delicious food.  Branzino and braised short rib are pretty incredible. Prices are fair based on quality.  Possibly a larger wine list (by glass). Definitely going back.",
        "I love that this salon provides a shuttle! It's very clean and friendly. The amount of colors to chose from is quite impressive! I got a gel polish for the first time and love the way my nails look and feel. Mani/pedi took exactly 1 hour and my toes and finger nails look great! This is officially where I'll b going to get my nails done when in Vegas!",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "I love this bar, it's my favorite in Vegas. The vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud. I love the art on the walls, the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture. Christina and Pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out. The cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly! Try the burning bush, it's smokey and delicious!",
        "this place is a solid 3 for me.  \\n\\nThe casino is ok.\\nthe buffeet is better than ok (carnival buffet)\\nthe spa is blah (yeah, it rhymes)\\nthe rooms are ok\\nthe beds are BAD.  \\n\\nbut for $200 for 3 nights (holiday weekend), there isn't much room to really complain.  They treated me right.",
        "I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones.",
        "Secured Auto Glass is a rarity in Las Vegas.  Very honest, low prices and exceptional service.  I though you would only find a company like this in a small midwest town.\\n\\nAsh, the owner, is a great guy and answered all my question.  I had my front windshield replaced.  I was in and out of there in an hour.\\n\\nI highly recommend them for your auto glass repairs. I would give him 10 stars if I could!",
        "Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!"

        "I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me.",
        "FUCK YOU APS!!!!  A $5 \\\"convenience\\\" fee for paying online?  I'm already paying 3 or 4 times the electricity cost due to your \\\"fees\\\", but its just a slap in the face when you slap a \\\"convenience\\\" fee onto an online payment.  APS is nothing but a sucky greedy company that has a monopoly and treats its customers like shit.  FUCK YOU APS.",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "Highly recommend! Never been to one of these places. Eric is a very nice and professional.  Great value 20.00 for hour massage, very peaceful, relaxing and clean. \\nTreat yourself and support local business!",

        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself.  I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups. The high ceilings, faux constructivist murals and red lightings make this place very dramatic and almost transport me back to Moscow. The only downside is that water service is sloooow and they don't have Russian standard any more.",
        "The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!",
        "Went here after finding it on yelp and it was everything people said. Cheap, Fast and friendly. Wish i could say the same about the DMV!, I Live in the far south anthem area but made the trip to this place. Id rather support a local business than those huge chains.",
        "Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\\n\\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again.",
        "Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "Awesome place. Sometimes hard to get seats so patience is a must or just flat out luck but totally worth it! Parking is easy and free.  Totally recommended and cant wait for a bigger location to open up! Prices are fair and sizes are perfect.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Really enjoyed the food and service. Delicious ribs and brisket. Mac & cheese was different, but very tasty. The owners were extremely attentive and friendly. Very reasonable prices...four of us ate for less than $40. Go try it out and support a local business",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday.",

        "went for restaruant week.\\nabsolutely fantastic.\\nthe filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.\\nthe creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. \\nthe staff are very professional and friendly. \\natmosphere compliements the entire experience.\\ni hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente",
        "At first site of the menu I wasn't impressed, but once the food arrived I was indeed satisfied. And the peanut butter chocolate pie topped it off at the end. I love how mostly everything on their menu is grilled, great healthy place to eat with family! Nice and Affordable",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",
        "worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.",
        "It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. \\n\\nMeh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food.",
        "DAMN. this show is GREAT.\\nyes, the tickets are expensive, but well worth the price.\\neverything is spectacular about the show. i think every seat in the theater is a good seat.\\nacrobatics and stunning visuals complete this show.",
        "The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",
        "Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.",
        "I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.",
        "LOL, I love that I am considered a regular on Yelp here when I was in Vegas for a week. We stayed at our time share across the street and they gave us vouchers for the restaurants. If you couldn't tell by the fact that I am a \\\"regular\\\", we went there a couple times because the food was good and inexpensive. If we stay at the timeshare again, I will definitely be back to Big Sur!",
        "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all.",
        "Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue.",
        "DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, \\\"Peaceful Pink\\\" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)",
        "This place runs out of certain donuts at a certain time. I was told it takes 3 hours to make chocolate munchkins.",
        "The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant",
        "I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Always need more check outs in the morning.",
        "Killer place in Mesa to get your munch on with your furry friends!\\nThe patio rawks (love the misters), and they allow smoking outside (yay!) - deal with it! Mitch's Mushroom served with sweet potato fries is the sammie of my dreams, and the bar kicks out a mean snakebite!!\\n\\nThanks guys, we'll see you soon!",
        "My kids are here skating an having a good time. Yes I will give a star for being nicer place then the other on Rancho but really they don't Support the Military an give a discount when the one on Rancho does. How about a little appreciation?  For this I give the rating I do. My son spends his time serving this country an my husband saying thanks sometimes is nice but OK.",
        "Excellent Italian Restaurant.\\nTheir Table D'Hote is a nice value.  Usually I have their excellent mussels to start and then one of their veal specials.   Dessert is so so.\\nAnother time  I had a scrumptious Lamb Shank dish,  however, it is rarely on the menu.\\nSuperior service.",
        "so basic. so loud. so dark. so packed. ugh and regulars sitting on the bar? really? like, 2 dudes, literally SITTINGG on the bar. i dont care who youre \\\"bro\\\" is, im trying to get a drink here. take off your too cool metal mulisha tee and let someone else enjoy a song or two .. before i get the heck out of here.",
        "Tried it for the first time tonight and the service was fast and portion size generous.\\n\\nOrdered the steak and broccoli with brown rice. The steak was tasty but a bit grizzly and fatty. My wife had the chicken which was much better.\\n\\nBroccoli was good but the rice was mushy. W",
        "Food was authentic and yummy. It was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine!! What a concept. No cork fees either.",
        "They showed up 20 minutes late at our hour long party, many kids were disappointed that they could not get their face painted\\nI tried to call them several times to find out what was happening and nobody answered. Nobody has contacted me to apologize,  \\nUnfortunately I had not seen previous reviews on this service, it seems that been late is normal for them\\nI would not recommend them",
        "Went for lunch, the food was okay, chicken kabbob were salty and broiled. The pita had 4 medium pieces of chicken and lots of  lettuce, and pickle with the yogurt sauce. I had hoped for better flavor and more meat (protein). Back to Sabas or Persian Room for lunch.",
        "I'm a KSBS BBQ judge, so I'm a BBQ snob.  I really liked the flavor profiles of the food, it was all over cooked.  Mac-n - cheese was bomb.  I think they do better than what I had so I'll go back and try again.",
        "As some one who has been coming here for years, I can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss. My family loves the baked spaghetti, pizzas, calzones, pizza muffins, and eggplant parm. I've had several of there other pasta dishes (eg: alfredo) and was not a fan. You just have to know what to order from there. The pizza and calzones are awesome!!!!!!",
        "Dub-step hipster bar - maybe I am getting too old for this stuff, but after a few drinks and some fun girl date company it wasn't so bad, especially since this is not my scene. The roof dance floor with projector screens of trippy colors made the whole thing as well as the hipster sightings.",
        "Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car",
        "Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.",
        "The noise,lights and animals are merely a cover-up for the slow service, lackluster food and expensive dishes. Don't expect to add a house salad to your $12.48 turkey wrap ladies and gents here they want 4.49 to add it as a side. $37+ later we won't come again.",
        "Clean diner. Friendly staff. Nice air-conditioned environment.\\nI ordered the steak and eggs special. Price was right but the steak was not steak. It tasted like mushed up processed meat reformed into a steak and left an extremely bad aftertaste in my mouth. Perhaps they should consider getting actual steak or mentioning that it is processed and seasoned.\\nThe hash browns were good and made from actual potato but that is about it.",
        "I had an awful experience - will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment/voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe - the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe.",
        "Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.",
        "PAYMORE.    Just like all the other reviews.  I was swindled.   I returned the car 95% full on gas, they then decided to charge me 29$ for additional gas.    Oh and I love when they say it's only 200$ for the week.  Get back and random fees equal up to 430$.   \\n\\nHow are these people still open?   I want to call the Better Business Bureau",

        "...I guess they could just let the vagrants move into this Post Office.  Seriously filthy facilities, many questionable sorts hanging around even at 4:30pm, and rude customer service.  I admittedly don't expect much from the USPS at this point, aside from overpriced and low quality service, but this place is seriously in need of an overhaul and at least a security guard.",
        "The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty.",
        "Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.",
        "Doughy. Is it really a bagel? Great atmosphere and fun to watch them flip the bagel. Got it to go and walked down the street munching away.",
        "The most fantastic thing about this quaint nieghborhood bar is they are CONSISTANTLY giving back to the community. They.never fail to give of their time and money when a cause or person is in need!

Cards and things... but what Things encompasses is anybodies guess, because most of the things in here that arent cards are a mish mash of just about every type of last munuite gift idea there ever will be - but only for the people you somewhat dislike and resent spending money on.",
        "They barely finished the restaurant the chairs are incredibly annoying there are not caps for the exposed brick and the food though it is delicious came out at probably 300 degrees! And for a business with the last name ALE doesn't have a very good beer selection. This is a newer bar and I just think there is a lot of room for growth just yet. Again even though there were some things I was unhappy with the food (most importantly) tasted incredible.",
        "I bought a travel zoo voucher for Cravings at the Mirage and so glad I did.  The quantity of choices are slim - compared to other buffets around town but the quality of food was very good.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the desserts.  I felt it could have been better.",
        "I don't want to give it any stars, it's a trick! the lobster isn't lobster it's mushy and gross.  It wasn't worth the price at all.  I really wish I hadn't insisted on coming here and paying more for less. The crab legs were the only thing I had that was good but you can't really mess that up. Next time I'm in town I'll pass on the buffet scene.",

        "My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back.",
        "So I was excited to try a new place. I loved the country music but that is about all. After being seated at a very wet table I sat for almost 10 minutes and was never greeted by a waitress. Many walked by me, but no one stopped to say hello. So my husband and I left.  Will never be back. Sorry. I love to support my Chandler restaurants, but that was horrible service.",
        "Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.",
        "Any coffee shop other than that overpriced overhyped Starbucks is good for me.  Located in the Palm's food court, you can get your coffee needs here.  I'm not a fan of McDonalds but love their coffee.  If it's coffee you want, then head over to McDonalds where is just as good, but much cheaper.  But if you want ice blend, cappuccino, espresso, then come over here.",
        "This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",
        "Great service! Amazing food! Great location. Lots of big screen TVs for viewing any kind of sporting event. Servers are friendly and service is fast. Had the three cheese jalape\\u00f1o burger - to die for! Great beer and drink selection as well. Roof top patio for the summer is amazing.",
        "No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade.",
        "New ownership.\\nIt is not Chicago-style pizza at all.  \\nThey didn't honor the $5 for $10 Yelp Deal I purchased.\\nWe ordered extra cheese pizzas to be delivered.  The pizza was mediocre, but the delivery was pretty fast.  I'd rather pick up a $5 Little Caesar's cheese pizza than order from them again.  \\nUnimpressed, but not disgusted.",
        "Amazing! I came here a few weeks ago, and had the best time! Be warned you'll be dancing until the sun comes up if your not careful! Females get two free drinks, thank goodness as the prices are expensive, so pre drinks before hand are a must! There is confetti and ribbons the explode from the roof! Ahhh sooo much fun! Def visit if ur in Vegas!",
        "We made the mistake buying a expensive deal voucher expecting a high end Chinese meal. The food was bland. But worse was the miserable staff. Not a smile among them with the exception of our waitress. I'm beyond upset that I spent as much as I did for 10$ Chinese deal.",
        "This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not.",
        "Honestly, this place was Eden to locals when it first opened. Nowadays it's super bro-like and bathrooms are filthy. Service is below average but the premises themselves are \\\"okay\\\". \\n\\nThe games certainly make up for the lack of quality but I do wish the place was as awesome as it was when it first opened.",
        "Having come from LA with a large Vietnamese community, this is not the same Bahn Mi I'm accustomed to. Heck they couldn't even make a decent vegetarian. \\n\\nI will commend them on their clean facilities and quick service however.

        "We have been coming to Wing Hing for at least 15 years now! It is hands down the best Chinese food in the valley! The have amazing egg drop soup, crab puffs are out of this world, and every entree is amazing! I have never had a bad meal there! The portion sizes are huge as well. This place is great...and the family that runs it is always extremely pleasant! Please try this place...you will not be disappointed!",

Hence I would not recommend them or use their printing services again.",
        "We've some stuff on the menu - burgers, a wrap, onion rings, fries, etc- and it was all fairly mediorce, but reasonably priced at around 7-8 bucks for dinner.  \\n\\nBut hey - the hot wings here are amazing.  No complaints.  They're perfect.  ORDER THE WINGS!!!",

Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me.",
        "I like this place. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot. It's a Charlotte institution, and the food is very good. The only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft... not thick as expected. Still good.",

On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",

They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up.",
        "This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average.

        "A good place to grab a quick bite or snack and coffee at Caezar's Palace.\\n\\nI had a delicious (and large) chocolate chip cookie with a 16 oz. mocha iced drink.  Both were sweet and good. Seating was in the main Food Court area, but plenty of spaces to just relax after walking around the Strip. Good spot to sit by the bar seats so you can people watch while you chill here. \\n\\nFriendly service.",
        "this place is a solid 3 for me.  \\n\\nThe casino is ok.\\nthe buffeet is better than ok (carnival buffet)\\nthe spa is blah (yeah, it rhymes)\\nthe rooms are ok\\nthe beds are BAD.  \\n\\nbut for $200 for 3 nights (holiday weekend), there isn't much room to really complain.  They treated me right.",
        "I am extremely impressed with the service Copperline Plumbing (Gabe) provided. He was very professional, friendly and quick to complete the repair. I didn't feel like I was overcharged either, which is a huge bonus when dealing with plumbing issues. I will definitely contact Copperline Plumbing for any future plumbing needs.",
        "The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.",
        "Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \\n\\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Pleasant service and a good selection of cacti are available here.  I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "I saw Le Reve a while ago when I got my free tickets from another web site.  Having seen all cirque shows, by far this and Love were my favorites but I think this show is #1.  The theater in the round was georgous..wonderful, comfy seats.  The sets/stages were the most spectacular that I have ever seen.  Performers first rate.  To this day I still talk about the spectacular experience. Definitely something to see.",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "Ark is OK.  I've had better rentals from hertz and also a local company Verve  http://www.VerveCarRental.com  They do cash car rentals in Las Vegas to like Ark does them.  There are lots of companies you can book  that are decent, it just depends on what you expect and your budget really of course!!",
        "This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\\nIt puts the whole community to shame.",
        "I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead.",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "Don't waste your time or money, incredibly slow service. I get that its family owned however they need to get with the times and truly make a effort to connect with their guests, especially first time guests. Very disappointed.",
        "ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!",
        "I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work.",
        "Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\\n\\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \\n\\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came.",
        "Awesome place. Sometimes hard to get seats so patience is a must or just flat out luck but totally worth it! Parking is easy and free.  Totally recommended and cant wait for a bigger location to open up! Prices are fair and sizes are perfect.",
        "The Marvel Experience, more like I took your money and there is nothing you can do. Do not go, 4-D will never happen. You will never be immersed in the 3-D and 4-D. \\n\\nThe Marvel website promised a lot, LOL. If you go do not expect a lot. Don't expect anything except long lines.",
        "We ate here last\\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",
        "Yum, yum, yum....need i say more?   Expected fast somewhat mediocre greek food....got the most delicious lunch!   Be sure to get the grilled chicken salad!",
        "Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.",
        "Valentina altered my wedding dress and it fit perfectly! I received numerous compliments on how well my dress fit me. My husband was breathless when he saw me in it. Valentina is fairly priced and she does an amazing job. She is extremely talented! You must book ahead of time because she books up fast.\\n\\nI highly recommend Valentina's Bridal and Tailors.",
        "Had an appointment scheduled with them a month in advance. Was hosting a special event at my home. Received a invoice morning of scheduled cleaning however when the appointment time came and passed nobody showed.  The owner Quian wouldn't answer her phone and the man at the office said he would have her call me and she never did. Very unreliable. Would not recommend this company.",
        "This place rocks!!   To be able to kick my feet up, drink my wine, have a blanket handy, and watch a movie was a great experience.  I only tried the dessert so maybe next time I'll try some of the pizzas.",
        "This is the place to go for all of your beer and liquor needs.\\nThey really are the cheapest in the city.\\nI come here for Heineken only. A 12pk will run you $11 and some change.\\n\\nThere's always plenty of parking.\\nStore his huge, bright and very clean.\\nWide variety of alcohol. More than what any one human needs.\\nStaff is very friendly.",
        "Pizza was not a great as we had expected and service was well below.  Pomo in Scottsdale is better and closer.  Probably won't go back. \\n\\nThe staff were not friendly and it wasn't even that busy - we went last night.  To much success has gone to there heads.",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "I love this family owned salon. Everyone is so friendly and nice and thoroughly skilled at doing good nails.  My gel nails last weeks with zero issues - no peeling or bubbling!!! Tiffany has a great eye too, I've gotten great recommendations for colors from her and her dad. You walk in and you are treated like a friend. So great :)",
        "Well the price was good but I was expecting more... Not to many options and I didn't like the food it had no taste to it. The waiter took for ever to serve us refills and I really thought the place was amazing but in reality it let me down.. :(",
        "OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!",
        "Professional and caring. Gary was always available to answer our questions and took extra time to explain in detail what was happening to our family. He managed the cleaning and repairs required to complete the transaction in a timely and professional manner. Even after the sale he continued to assist us, I highly recommend Gary and his company and will be using him again in the future.  Thanks again Gary for a job well done.",
        "Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.",
        "We just walked out of this establishment, after having been seated and left alone with menus for 10 minutes. Tables around us were already seated and they had no drinks.  We watched as the guy that seated us walked around filling water glasses. We decided to walk down to Pei Wei for carryout instead. \\n\\nTwo stars for the comfortable chairs though.",
        "Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "Small, easy to navigate, a good middle-class hotel. Stayed in the \\\"Playboy Tower\\\" which was nice. Within walking distance to the Gold Coast and Rio, but not much else. Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM.",
        "Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant.",
        "I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special. There was no TV, period on our 5 hour flight from NY. All the kids in the plane were going nuts. The seats are very cramped and small. The plane seemed very old. \\n\\nGo Delta, if you have kids.",
        "I liked Lago but I didn't love it.  I think it had something to do with their selection which is no where neat the size of Le Village Buffet in Paris.  The food that I did have was very good.  I was there for breakfast and the omelet station was appreciated.  I would be willing to return if I were walking through Caesar's and hunger hit me -- especially during breakfast time.",
        "Since writing this review I've received two e-mails from Sushi Samba employees suggesting I return and that they are genuinely sorry that I had a bad experience and are sure it won't repeat.  \\n\\nMy question is:  Where was this level of service when I was eating there?\\n\\nLike hell I'm going to spend another hundred something dollars for them to prove to me that they don't suck.",
        "I was expecting so much more from this restaurant.  There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.",
        "Yes, the menu prices are over the top.\\nThe food is good.\\nLots of menu selections ... with good service.\\n\\nIf your 401K plan or IRA account, has held its value, you'll be able to\\nafford eating here.",
        "Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk.",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "It looks like this place has a lot to offer, training, nutrition, smoothies. Today must have been an off day, unless this is just how business is conducted here, but I was never greeted, never acknowledged by the worker right in front of my face and felt completely overlooked. I understand there are other customers to be helped but a simple hello, I will be with you shortly would have sufficed.",
        "Since writing my initial review, I have received several messages from the business owners accusing me of making false claims, being a \\\"troll\\\" and making accusations that I wrote a bad review because I didn't like a post on Facebook that they made. It has been absolutely absurd.",
        "After getting ripped off by Leslies Pool for Pool supplies and repairs, I now go miles out of my way to shop at B & B for all my Pool needs.  They are HONEST and reasonably priced. All of their technicians are knowledgeable in Pool maintenance and  repair.",
        "DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, \\\"Peaceful Pink\\\" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)",
        "I was very excited to get the opportunity to play Shadow this week.  It was everything I expected it to be.  Great layout, perfect fairways and greens, very friendly staff, and great forecaddies.  If you get the opportunity, you have to play it!",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "I guess I was expecting more.  The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good.  But I guess growing local and being \\\"fresh\\\" come at a cost.  Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.",
        "My husband and I attended Chef Alyssa's Dressed Up Game Day class in September. What a cool venue and a very fun date night! We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed meeting the other members of our kitchen team that night. We have already made the sweet potato wedges twice  since the class and are looking forward to making the baked wings (SO GOOD!) soon. We are looking forward to booking another class soon- maybe with some friends this time.",
        "We walked in on a Sunday morning, we're seated immediately. The wait staff were excellent, as was the food.  We had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another table-no problem.  Some of the best service I have had in recent years in Vegas-sweet!",
        "not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....\\nThe Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :(",
        "Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed.",
        "The food is definitely something that needs improvement! The pizza dough is tasteless and overall in need of improvement. Burgers and wings are just average bar food  - nothing special at all. If you like to bet on horse and dog races then this maybe your place to go.",
        "Ok so I came back here the other day, for nostalgia more than anything, and I realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else. Don't get my wrong, I LOVE Baguette Express, but it's always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing, particularly in this branch!!",
        "So... it's a neighborhood place - nothing more, nothing less.  The service all depends on how busy they are - if they are slow, you can expect good service. If they are busy, not so much.  BUT - I love their chicken wings and fries! Any time I have a craving for chicken wings, I end up here!",
        "Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  \\nAbove average food, better service, higher than expected prices.",
        "The customer service in this store is terrible. A Manager by the name if Justin was rude and sarcastic and needs a belt to hold his pants up. If Oreily thinks guys like Justin are good managers than corporate has a poor judge of character and customer service.",
        "Service needs some improvement.Sushi was terrible ! Lacked freshness and most of all flavor...they tasted the same or it was blasted with spice so you could not savor ask the different flavors. I eat sushi regularly....know good and promise me..save you're monies and go elsewhere. if you're an experienced sushi eater you will be disappointed",
        "McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.",
        "Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!",
        "great place to have your battery recharged. they require that you bring your own oil back to the recycle bin... which is gross and impossibly filthy. i really can't leave this place without getting dirty. but hell, i really can't complain. i like getting dirty.",
        "Horrible burger. Pale color, no flavor, pretty bun but very greasy. Fries were delicious, fresh and hot. Service was ok. For a place called burger anything you'd expect good burgers. This isn't it."

Big mistake...the food was gross, there was not much of a variety, and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night. \\n\\nThe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive.",
        "Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure.",

She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere.

I will come back & bring friends.",

Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself.

        "Very unique and authentic breakfast. This is not a \\\"IHOP\\\" type. Everything is made and presented delicately. Will definitely go back to check out the salads.",
        "Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food.",
        "We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel....",
        "We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book.",

        "i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",
        "If you want wine and have no idea what you're doing, ask for help. They truely know their stuff. All recommendations have been great!  They have wine classes and my favorite beer The Optimator!  Coupons sometimes in newspaper or online.",
        "Food is just ok and the employees I've dealt with are so rude (girls) and if you ask them for anything they act put out.",
        "Fantastic.  Only complaint was the late reservation.  Great ambiance. Great staff. Great menu. And delicious food.  Branzino and braised short rib are pretty incredible. Prices are fair based on quality.  Possibly a larger wine list (by glass). Definitely going back.",
        "You're greeted by the hot air and the sound of slot machines as soon as you step out of the airplane. You know that you're in Lost Wages!!! The shuttle system is quite good, and the shops are nice too. Checked baggage also arrives promptly.",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "I love this bar, it's my favorite in Vegas. The vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud. I love the art on the walls, the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture. Christina and Pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out. The cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly! Try the burning bush, it's smokey and delicious!",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.",
        "I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \\n\\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!",
        "Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck..",
        "Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place.",
        "I don't eat here but my girls need a little KFC fix every once and awhile. This location is close to my house so that is where I take them. could use a little fixing up inside and let's be honest it is KFC. Sometimes girls get chicken that should have been tossed but for the most part they are happy with their food.",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Visiting from CA and my fellow traveler recommended we stop in here to pick up a few things. Nice layout and good prices.  My only complaint is the bananas were green.  I appreciate that at home so they last longer, but when wanting to eat one now it kinda sucks.  Matt the cashier was very friendly and cool as was the bag boy.  Nice place...he said it's family owned and operated.  Like it better than Sprouts which they have in SoCal.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",
        "Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.",
        "I was there this week twice..awesome food...taste great...and a cool staff ....great job with this new location...dish that you should try stuffed quinoa avocado. .Yummy",
        "Amazing bagels, it is by far the best bagel you can have. I always eat at least one before I even leave the store. \\n\\nIn Montreal, there is always a debate about who the best but for me I give my vote to Fairmount. In addition to the great taste, it remains soft even after I freeze it for a month.",
        "if you don't eat here at least once in your life you haven't really lived a fulfilling life .. from the smile and the service the food is just to die for .. ONE NOTICE don't use the wash room !",
        "Gus's is a fifties-themed diner, so ambience is what it is--get over it.  I've been here for breakfast a few times, and I'm happy to report that the fare is just fine.  The service is friendly and attentive. I can't remember the last time (if there ever was one) that I was blown away by breakfast food, so what more can you ask for?",
        "Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check.",
        "The nacho selection did not impress me I like real cheese on my nachos bummer. \\n\\nI ordered the chips and salsa, chips were bathed in salt and only one salsa was tasty. I went for the burger as my entree which was actually pretty good.",
        "My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",
        "The bar tenders are always super nice and friendly. I've eaten at this location about ten times, and the food is yum. However, I feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food. I usually eat in the restaurant, but the one time I ordered curb side to-go, they messed my order up.",
        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "31 different types of crafts on tap + some wines + great food what more can you ask for! Been here twice in less than a month, and will be def going back. Totally work a try :)",
        "The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "A+ amazing stuff. I love the feel of the place, the service is casual but professional and the food is next level outstanding. When it is on the ever changing menu, give the lamb osso bucco a try - it is fantastic. Prices are reasonable to boot.",
        "I love this place. Everytime I come to Scottsdale, I have to visit, a couple of times too  No matter what I try, I'm never disappointed, never!\\n\\nLast night I had the chimichanga (sp?) and it was delicious!  I felt it could have been shared but it made for a great lunch today.",

        "Big selection and nice people! Definitely going back to check out more!",
        "ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!",
        "My wife just got a haircut at this place and she seems to be pretty happy with her experience. Full marks for the ambience. The stylist name was Nathan and he seemed to be friendly and did a great job. Will be going there again. I strongly recommend R Salon.",
        "While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.",
        "I love Dean and Deluca...they always have the best sandwiches and salads!  When I arrived in town for Thanksgiving, it was the first place I visited.\\n\\nI love that you can visit and get a whole meal to go, eat lunch there, or go for a dessert and coffee.  It truly is all things for all people.\\n\\nI only wish we had one in Houston!",
        "The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\\n\\nI can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?",
        "I'm just visiting Las Vegas from Hawaii and I've got to say that this nail salon was pretty good and not to mention good pricing! If I did my nails like this back home they'd probably charge me so much. I forgot to ask the name of the nail technician but it seemed like she was the owner but overall my experience here was great. She also told me what to tell my nail salon back home if I wanted to fill it.",
        "Tried to eat there once, got sat at a table, picked out a beer..enjoyed the artwork all around...but no one ever came to take my order! I was in plain view of the hostess, and the only person of 8 in the place that wasn't eating, yet. I got up and left.",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\\n\\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \\n\\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came.",
        "I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias.\\n\\nIn the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",
        "Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!",
        "If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of.  And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass.  Wtf!?  This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus?  Will not be coming back.  Get it together .",
        "Great place to sleep while on vacation, soft pillows and beds. The bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time. The food options you have at the ARIA are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat.",
        "I had given up on West Elm, I had put them in the same category as Ikea until I walked into this location.  I have been to West Elm in Denver, San Diego, and in Virginia, but this location has the perfect store design and employees.  If you like West Elm you'll love this location.  If you've give up on West Elm, I suggest you give it one last try and visit this store.",
        "Two hours later, still waiting. Others checked in after me seen. Service has gone downhill in the past year. And new policy of holding debit card isn't the best. Harder to fight inaccurate charges",
        "all of their food are good and healthy.except for the shrimp. i love this place.recommended for everyone to try them out.",
        "The Vegas meets Italy pizza is one of the best tasting pizzas in the neighborhood. Also the guys there really care about the food they sell and will gladly elaborate on any questions you might have. Go, eat, and be merry.",
        "I have been here several times and they have never gotten my order right. I have never actually had something there that was cooked the way I ordered it. They even forgot the salad I ordered one time until the waitress brought the check. The last time I went my husband and I both got sick off the food. The atmosphere is fun, but that's about all it has going for it.",
        "Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.\\n\\nCibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts.",
        "These guys are great - they texted me pictures of my animal while i was away - i would hands down hire them again and recommend them to anyone! Charges are reasonable and they provide very good customer service too!",

        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "We ate here last\\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.",
        "I am really disappointed overall-overpriced for portion of chips which looked like soggy potatoes (not very clean either-they should change the fryers more often). I have been ask to pay extra for mayo?! Really????",
        "Everytime I go to Vegas we stay at different hotels just so we can try them out and find the right hotel. MGM was pretty nice but the room we had which was the Celebrity Spa Suite had outdated furniture.\\n\\nI still had a good time. This casino is huge! Lots of places to visit and the monorail is in this casino as well. Food court and all. So pretty much everything you need is in this hotel. Tabu Lounge, Studio 54 and much more."

        "My favorite holiday happens to be Halloween & for my current job we also have a lot of different occasions where we have to dress up. This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",

Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",

Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!

        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",

Other than that, service is great and food/wine is excellent.",

Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",

Waitress didn't know what a Thug Passion was and then asked if we were looking for drugs. All that was fine because the music was good and people were having fun.

        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",
        "The music sucks! Dj was really bad. Bunch of guys and not enough females. Dance floor too crowded",
        "After getting ripped off by Leslies Pool for Pool supplies and repairs, I now go miles out of my way to shop at B & B for all my Pool needs.  They are HONEST and reasonably priced. All of their technicians are knowledgeable in Pool maintenance and  repair.",
        "The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle.",
        "Absolutely love this place! You instantly feel at ease and happy the second you walk in the door. Such a personable, fun and sincere staff! Dr.Ashley is a true master at what she does. This is the best Med Spa I've ever been to, and would love to spend every day there, as they're not only fun to talk to, they know how to make you look and feel beautiful!\\nThey also have great specials and their prices are really affordable.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "Grrrr\\nHated it!\\nI love this chain,but hate this location!",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.",
        "they have phantom charges on our bill for  the natural gas for the grills and they charges us for refilling the pool after they had it emptied, take forever on fixing things. now after i went in in december to put my notice in not sure when we were going to have a house they said don't worry you only have to give 30 days notice.. lie! they are going to charge us a full extra month 1500 for not giving proper notice.",
        "We used to love this place but inexplicably they have eliminated waiters and turned it into a take out spot. It's one of the Most bizarre setups I have ever experienced. People are walking all over the place so you can't really relax, no bartender anymore, extremely understaffed. We will most likely never return.\\n\\nI saw the Slots turned off,, so maybe lost the gaming license?",
        "I really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area. pool is nice trainers are great too. I usually go after work and its never too crowded. they also have some great spin classes.",
        "Great place to shop at, a lot of different stores to choose from.  Parking is fairly easy, especially when it's not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days.",
        "I booked here with a bit of apprehension but we were going to a concert across the street at the MGM and the price was half of the MGM  We had a great time here. Service was excellent, pool was very nice and the room was great. It was not as nice or as clean as the MGM but well worth the money,  There is, of course, a Hooters restaurant but the Mad Onion restaurant was excellent food and service.  Would stay again in a heartbeat",
        "Pow, Judy makes it better.  \\n\\nI never feel like I have time to or money for a massage but when I go I wonder why it took so long!  She has a tidy little room where she works her magic.  She is simply fantastic!  \\n\\nThis is not your spa or chain store massage, this is deep tissue as intense as you desire.  She has several different styles but I prefer a strait sports massage.",
        "I give this place 5 stars- not for the rooms but for the staff who were amazing- I left a bag with a laptop in it & staff/security - got home to southern cal before I realized it- The security staff- lost and found - hotel front desk- went above and beyond to locate it for me - thank you paris staff for exceptional service during a difficult day- great location- loved pool & DJ - fun for couples",
        "Save your $300 initial consultation and go to a Macy's personal shopper--they are free.",
        "This is just a bad chain bar.  Went on three different occassions with large parties over the course of a year and service was the most consistently unfriendly we have seen.  We all love courntry music and the quality of the music was a big plus but the far below average food and uppity wait staff just make it a not enjoyable environment.  Would not go back.",
        "Rooms are very nice and comfortable, staff is great! I was there for a meeting on a Sunday through Tuesday and the room literally shook all night from the XS night club music! I ate in 3 of their restaurant's that were good but stupid expensive, go down the road to Morton's for a superior steak for much less. The pool was nice but also way to pricey! $8 beer? $16 house maggie? WTF???",
        "6 months to remodel office which was already plush! Zero repairs to rundown apartments, multiple office & maintenance crews and still nothing is fixed! Then they have the audacity to raise rent $125 while refusing to make units livable!  Forget about using gym, pool or basketball court unless you want to pay more money and only use while office is open! Rude, lazy staff as well. Much nicer, more affordable places in town.",
        "THE place to watch a sporting event in Vegas. Tons of seating and large TV's. My dream is to watch a big game here and rent a room with a pool table. Those rooms easily run a couple of thousand but one can dream. I love all the signed jerseys all over the place.",
        "Enjoyed the ambiance here when I passed through for a book launch shortly before the holidays. Ideal for a literary evening, or for a conversation with a well-suited friend at the bar, the space feels like it's tucked with decor brought home from long travels. Hints of Havana and East India in the 1950s when the light is just right. I only had a beer but glanced over the cocktail menu and would be curious to return.",
        "I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is great - every person really friendly and helpful. My favorite dishes  are the chop chop salad and pork fried rice. The bartenders will make you a special cocktail if you give them a basic flavor profile, which is a great way to try a new drink or two.",
        "They really know what they are doing out there. Chris made the most perfect mule cocktail that I have ever had. They might not have a lot in stock, but they pack a punch with everything",
        "The location is great (being in the centre of Places des Arts), and the decor is great. They have really good cocktails but the food is just below average. Go there for the drinks and the ambience, not for the food.",
        "This place is great for a business hotel or if you don't gamble and/or with the family.\\n\\nBig, comfortable, well appointed rooms.  Nice pool, decent bar and food.\\n\\nNo casino, but a little walk to Caesar's.\\n\\nThis is my detox hotel.  Usually I book a night or two here before staying on the strip.  Keeps the expenses down  LOL.",
        "AMAZING PEOPLE! They provide great services in grooming and boarding, and today they just warmed my heart. They donated their time to help an abandoned dog, on a holiday no less. If your looking for exceptional care and people to groom or board your loved furry friends, Planet Petopia is it!!!!!",
        "After seeing my 2nd show here, I can say it will be my last.  Super over-priced drinks, and if you aren't near the stage, it's almost impossible to get a good view.  I don't know why bands continue to have poolside concerts.. The Hard Rock pool is even worse.  I'd much rather see a show at a regular venue with a decent layout.",
        "First time at Hanny's.  Cool vibe, great cocktails and the food we had was very good.  Prosciutto pizza and the pork entree both well prepared and fresh. Menu is somewhat limited - expected more entrees.  Menu primarily pizza, salads and sandwiches.  But if it's all as good as our dinner, it's enough.   We'll be back.",
        "This evening we had bacon rapped dates, ahai tuna, chicken, hummus, bbq sliders, Mac & Cheese, all appetizers evening. Excellent service and ambiance was wonderful for a private dinning. Music was light in the background. The dinner was a quick yelp decision but, Embers is a romantic environment to slow down and enjoy a late night bite.",
        "If I could give 10 stars, I would. A friend and I literally stumbled upon this pizzeria on our attempt to make it to Crescent Ballroom. We sat at the bar, had a bottle of wine (great Italian variety) with amazing apptizers, we almost past on pizza until we noticed the owner watching every pizza cook individually and making sure each one got just enough heat . Finallly people in AZ who know pizza. Thank you. Traditional pizza done right.",
        "Get an entry level foot spa, and then you can enjoy this great place for a whole day!",
        "Very nice atmosphere if you like walking around looking at casino and shops.\\n\\nHowever, this place is way overpriced, with $10 cocktails.",
        "Best pizza in Anthem by far! Actually the best pizza I have found in phoenix so far.  This particular Barros has way better pizza than some of the other Barros in the valley. ..not sure why but it is worth driving to this one if you want a great pizza.  The prices are awesome too.  Great value! Large 2 topping for under $10 it's a steal.  Way better than a $20 pizza at a major chain.",
        "Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.",
        "I dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur. I recently stayed here and it was great. Everything was clean, nice flat screen tv, walk in shower. Got upgraded for free too. :)\\n\\nThe pool was off the hook!",
        "Waterfall is too loud \\nI had gnocchi, just blah.  Not bad but not good either.   Wife had beef on weck bland beef and certainly not a good bun.   \\nGreat place to come for a cocktail and hang out but get your dinner somewhere elser",
        "I know it is a McDonald's. I get it. But as far as a fast food chain goes, this particualr McDonald's has my loyalty. \\n\\nTalk about your fast friendly service. Whether I am ordering just coffee or a couple hash browns for my boy and I on the way into school I know I will be through the drive-thru in 5 minutes tops!",
        "Me and a friend came here after dinner at the Pink Pony to have a drink and people watch. Great service and a pretty center bar to relax. I'd like to come back for dinner here.*",
        "I love thai food and eat it whenever I can. This is the first place in the whole valley I have found that serves my favorite dish evil jungle princess. It is so tasty and they do it very well. They are always busy and servers are always working hard. My fiance has had a few different dishes and is always happy with his picks as well.",
        "ummm knife tears and bodily fluids on the pool table... when my group left (RIGHT after we walked in) on Friday night, there were exactly 46 cockroaches left in the bar to keep each other company... HORRIBLE would be a compliment. At least they (I mean HE) were showing Jim Rose circus tricks on the tv. somebody was puking up milk and re drinking it... I think he was on location at Rogue from the night before.",
        "Love the milk tea boba drinks here! They have a variety of tea selections. Great place to hang and relax in the late night. Great staff and customer service. I am starting to sample the other drinks and the staff can help make suggestion and explain what are the different drinks they offer.  I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",
        "\\\"It's a chain. It's fondue. BUT perfect for the right occasion. I would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates. You get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on. Pretty pricey however.\\\"",
        "Best start to my days and always a favorite amongst visiting family and friends. Can't beat the cupcakes or breakfast! Also a great place to drink coffee, relax, hangout or study.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "LOVE! Great staff, cool vibe, good lookin cats and probably had the best Vegas DJ spinnin the night I went. DJ Casanova! \\n\\nWe had a table on the rooftop and were taken care of very well. Security guards were very nice and the waitress was cute. I'll be coming back here every time I come to Vegas :)",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "Was here last night for a Family Soft Opening. This used to be Carmine's but was gutted and looks great. Plenty of TVs to watch the game. \\n\\nThe food and drink selection was excellent. The \\\"Mad Mule\\\" was a great cocktail. Food was excellent, very large portions. I enjoyed the Chicken Salad and it was delicious. \\n\\nI have high expectations for this bar. Hopefully becomes the new local spot!",
        "Went here for a few cocktails last Saturday night and the sofas are comfy, the cocktails damn tasty and the nachos were lovely. The jug of water for the table had an orange wedge and hibiscus flowers in it, yet this seemed more like a touch of attention to detail rather than pretension. When a place is that classy and yet seems totally laid back, it's a place to go back to!",
        "For a college town-exceptional choices of tequila!  Some of the bartenders can get off the high horse and be a lil more friendly. DJ keeps crowd jumping!",
        "I would follow Tina anywhere. In fact, I did to her newly opened shop. It's very relaxing and clean with great massage pedi spa chairs. Seriously you won't find better nail talent in this city and she does your nails exactly how you want. I recommend is spa to all of my friends and even my customers when they are visiting in town and ask where to get their nails done.",

        "I like almost everything about LVAC except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while I'm trying to relax in the jacuzzi. I don't like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer.  Note: It was not during the cleaning hours that is posted.",
        "Some of the best fried rice in the state. Seafood hotpot is amazing. Connoisseur cocktails you've never heard of...",
        "Great pizza. Very friendly staff. Slices are very big and you can add additional toppings to their already made pizzas. Cool find.   Grab a slice, a glass of wine and walk out front to the sofas by the pool table.",
        "Kind of disappointed in the hotel! I did not have a bad experience but I expected more! Staff was friendly! Rooms need an update! They are pretty simple and it's obvious they don't want you spending more time then needed in there! The casino is nice again friendly service! Their pool and fitness center was great!",
        "Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort."

        "I've seen this restaurant change its face several times. This time I hope it stays this way. Both times we ordered carry-out, the servers were wonderful. Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. \\n\\nThe 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.\\n\\n I highly recommend this place.",
        "Great food, huge menu with a good selection. Tuesday's are 4 tacos for $10, great deal! Service was a little slow but everything else was very good",
        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "FUCK YOU APS!!!!  A $5 \\\"convenience\\\" fee for paying online?  I'm already paying 3 or 4 times the electricity cost due to your \\\"fees\\\", but its just a slap in the face when you slap a \\\"convenience\\\" fee onto an online payment.  APS is nothing but a sucky greedy company that has a monopoly and treats its customers like shit.  FUCK YOU APS.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "i came in around 4. it was very slow. I got up and walked around the market and still didn't get anywhere on the list. they blow the hair around with an air compressor, talk about messy. I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",
        "This garage is hit or miss.\\n\\nCompletely depends on what is going on (events etc...) Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\\n\\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!",
        "Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck..",
        "I ordered the Chicken Fajitas which were average.  The food is nothing special and the service is very slow.",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "One of the slower Starbucks I have ever been to lately.  Are they union employees?  They managed to screw up my order too.",
        "Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!",
        "So when we came the first time the service was great , today was horrible thanks to a slow rude Jackie. First she overlooked us for about 20 minutes then took our drink order and came back another 20 minutes later. Food another 30 later and of course NO FRIES. someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill. She never checked back! I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk.",
        "Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.\\n\\nHighly recommended place for breakfast!",
        "This place is way overrated. They hook you with their one signature item (a glorified Mocha Ice Blended from Coffee Bean) and get you for their overpriced basic menu items. The service is sooooooooo slow, especially for a place that really isn't that big. Good place to hang out if you're in the right mood and the right people though I suppose.",
        "Don't waste your time or money, incredibly slow service. I get that its family owned however they need to get with the times and truly make a effort to connect with their guests, especially first time guests. Very disappointed.",
        "I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \\\"Subway Effect\\\" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",
        "This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. \\n\\nYou have to see this if you are in Vegas!",
        "While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.",

        "Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!",
        "Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.",
        "Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!",
        "Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty. \\nService was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do. \\nThere was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown. \\nWould never be going back....",
        "I've been here twice (because after my first time I didn't want to go back but decided to give it another try). Both times they were slow behind the counter (trying to be like a Chipotle) and the food was just not enjoyable at all. Would rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba.",

        "The food was fine but not amazing.  The decor is done very well.  The problem is that the service is so incredibly slow that even if the food was 5 star, the overall experience would still be average.",

When we want a quick burger, this is the place for it! \\n\\nYou can see the fries are made right there before they are cooked so you know they haven't been sitting around half the day. \\n\\nSimple menu, just a few choices, and delicious! Always a good choice for a quick meal on the go.",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "So... it's a neighborhood place - nothing more, nothing less.  The service all depends on how busy they are - if they are slow, you can expect good service. If they are busy, not so much.  BUT - I love their chicken wings and fries! Any time I have a craving for chicken wings, I end up here!",

        "Restaurants don't provide many gluten free or veggie options. Elevator nazis are rude. Wifi in rooms is incredibly slow. This place is stuck in 1998",

        "I agree with Fiona, this place is a little too swanky for this part of town.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is a little basic, but they claim it's styish all over the website. The food is alright, nothing fancier than you can pick up in the tesco finest range. It leaves alot to be desired.\\n\\nIf your mum opened a trendy resturant, this is what it would be like.",
        "Since my first experience, I've gone back 3 times. There is definitely a lack of turn-around time regarding the point of ordering and receiving your good. \\nThe place gets a few large orders, and if you are the unlucky one who gets stuck behind those orders, it is a test of patience. I still believe they need to improve their process regarding high order times. It is simply unacceptable...",
        "Yum!  Best fried catfish I have ever had.  The staff is super friendly the food is great.  The desert menu changes daily but if you have the chance to try the bread pudding, go for it!  The shrimp etouffe is a great buttery, garlic wonderland in your mouth.",
        "My favorite Thai restaurant, in fact, we don't like to go anywhere else!  I drive from Summerlin area to Henderson to get my Thai fix, that's how much I love this place,\\n\\nPad Thai - scrumptious, perfect blend of sweet and savory, not oily or dry\\nPanang curry - love the mixture of coconut and curry\\n\\nYou won't go wrong with this Thai choice.",
        "Great breakfast spot.  I prefer the other location on Ironwood, as the acoustics kinda suck here and it gets noisy.  But same good grub.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, service friendly.",
        "Nice Location.  Utterly forgettable food.  Insanely slow service.  The place was slow and the waiters just could not have cared less about our group.  Sort of unreal.",
        "Quaint set up.  ALMOST reminds me of HOT (my personal fave).  Menu items look good and there's a good variety.\\nNewspaper on hand to read which I really like.  Courtyard/patio dining, with misters, option.  Very limited seating indoors.\\nI had the pulled pork and it was fantastic.\\nI will be back.",
        "Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation.",

        "I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips. It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant. We never had a server come to our table. Waited 15 mins and nothing??? We did get chips, which were from a bag and not fresh. The salsa was also not very stellar. We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back",
        "I cannot really explain how slow the service is. We were seated and waited about 10 mins till we went to the bar to get service. We then waited another 30 or so for food. Our drinks were never refilled. The whole time  we watched about 5 hostesses sit around and and do nothing. Not worth $13 for a burgers.",
        "Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.",
        "I wasn't even in the restaurant for a full 10 minutes before I was denied service because my cousin went to use the restroom when we entered. Apparently you can't use the restroom here folks without the manager accusing you of being too drunk when in fact she wasn't even drinking. The manager had a major condescending attitude. FYI it wasn't even busy yesterday and they denied service to some very generous travelers. I didn't even know what to say. Awful.",

The mojitos are delicious too and come by the pitcher if you want.  Just a great fun delicious place and for the prices you can't go wrong.  Every one I have ever taken here loves it and I have taken more than a few.",
        "This evening we had bacon rapped dates, ahai tuna, chicken, hummus, bbq sliders, Mac & Cheese, all appetizers evening. Excellent service and ambiance was wonderful for a private dinning. Music was light in the background. The dinner was a quick yelp decision but, Embers is a romantic environment to slow down and enjoy a late night bite.",
        "Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.",

The owner Marty Shapiro is a Madison celebrity. 5 stars.\\\"",

        "We used to eat at the Good Egg on Union Hills regularly, however the service and food had been disappointing the past few visits.  It's unfortunate the manager is lazy and it has degraded the operations.  Food is slow to come out and undercooked.

        "Horribly slow here with food, and some items were just downright foul (eggs in the breakfast burrito).  Hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though, as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce.  No real drive-thru.  What the heck?",
        "This review is for Sunday NFL Breakfast - good food as in the 'all you can eat' breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. Good bar food. Also good was the French toast - 6 large triangles with good (maple) syrup. Service is SLOW here in the morning though with only one cook. But hey... it's Sunday NFL and the beer is cold and cheap and the wait staff is smiling all morning long while you watch your favorite teams play ball.",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "Consistently ok food. I adore the fish tacos. Other meals I've had there are literally not memorable. It is a small, clean little place. The service I've had here has been pretty good on most occasions, but can be a little slow.",
        "Not too shabby, however, the service was quite slow, for such a busy area. The food was also just average, and the lobster, well, for the price the portion was tiny. While there are a few good items on the menu, it certainly is more of a tourist trap. Just an average place with average food and service, overpriced.",
        "Wow!  Happy hour wings are the best!  Nachos portion is huge and great price for what you get.  You may need to keep on your server cause it's a little hectic in there but happy hour is the way to go here... My kids love the lazer tag and video games!  Not bad for little Surprise ;)\\n\\nDon't expect the waitresses to be quick.  Ours was very slow.",
        "had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!",
        "Great place for a lazy Saturday morning coffee date. Things that are awesome here: coffee, sandwiches, pastries, and praline bacon. They have a wide variety of wines and beers that are more affordable than you would expect. Service is a little slow, so not somewhere to hit up if you're pressed for time.",

They exploit their employees in the Us and abroad.",

        "I really like their food, especially their breakfast burritos and chocolate shakes. The service can be a little slow sometimes. I've gone there to eat at the restaurant and ordered the same thing to go and the to go meal is like 1/2 to 3/4 of the meal you eat there. When I bring it up to then they argue and say it's not true. Whatever. I will continue to go here but only for their breakfast burritos.",
        "Dutch Bros is a place that I forget I love until someone surprises me with a drink from there.

The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",

I'd almost give it five stars, but would want to try other items on the menu first.",

Great for small/medium groups as you can score a seat almost any night of the week.",

Everything tasted very good, and was a reasonable price (we ordered from the lunch menu). I'll be going back.",

        "The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!",
        "I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \\n\\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.",

I like the pashmina selection- quite affordable, but really not the type of store to write home about as their seem to be a lot of similar little shops about.",
        "WORST consignment store in the Valley, and no wonder they are going out of business.  They never attempted to sell a very unique piece of art work I brought to consign, instead they \\\"donated\\\" a day after contract expired.  It's no wonder their sales people are rude and ignorant as they are completely unhappy they are going out of business and will never be able to open another business again...these guys are absolute crooks!",

        "Not the greatest mall in the valley, but also not the worst! Decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court. They recently added an aquarium which I think will add to the appeal. It's a shame that they closed Gameworks.",
        "Gross. \\n\\nLo Mein was incredibly salty, without much other flavor. \\n\\nEgg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",
        "I've been in this store a few times but mostly all at night or early AM. I have never have had any issues with service. It's conventionally located to home. It's open 24/7 & has most things one may need. Prices are a little more expensive vs Wal-Mart but you pay for the convenience!",
        "Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered.",
        "Seriously, awesome is all I can say. Chef Chris is so funny and friendly and he makes awesome sushi and sashimi! I used to love sushi narita in this same spot but I must say he out does them, awesome screaming o, great tuna sashimi  , this will for sure be a weekly visit, check them out you won't be sorry!",
        "The most hostile people I have ever met.  Horrible in every respect, I am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver.  My experience with XS was hands down the worst I have ever had with any venue, ever.  They ruined my birthday, embarrassed me, and I believe potentially charged me for it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!",
        "Rooms are very nice and comfortable, staff is great! I was there for a meeting on a Sunday through Tuesday and the room literally shook all night from the XS night club music! I ate in 3 of their restaurant's that were good but stupid expensive, go down the road to Morton's for a superior steak for much less. The pool was nice but also way to pricey! $8 beer? $16 house maggie? WTF???",
        "I wouldn't give any stars for this dump of a place ... The floor was dirty , some of there machines were broken  &  filthy .. No manager or workers to be found & when they are around , they are rude  ..  I've been to this place twice and would never come back . I would rather pay more $ at a place that is clean and have friendly  helpful workers . I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy .......",
        "Really wanted this to be good.....very dissatisfied.  Fish was dry, food was, in general not to the caliber I would have wanted from what they are representing.  Service was fair.  Good idea but for us, a miss.",
        "We chose to eat here when there was too long of a wait at La Unica, and I'm glad we did! The food was delicious, the staff was friendly- they answered all questions and helped us decide what to get. This place is a hidden gem! The tamale was HUGE and unlike anything I've ever had. We will definitely return!",

        "I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's.",
        "Over the last two years the food quality is consistently going downhill. Their happy hour selection is filled with fried carbohydrates and the wine selection is cheap. During the cooler months when you want to sit on the patio and enjoy the views it's difficult to get a seat and happy hour is not recognized. Could be a great place they need to bring their quality up",
        "A great downtown location, an appropriately-sized setup in a beautiful building, a clean, modern aesthetic. \\n\\nGiant was obviously well-funded. That's about it for the positives. \\n\\nIf you like bitter, overpriced, pre-sweetened (!!!) 'coffee' served by an obnoxious, barely-legal hipster sporting a cardigan in July, this place is for you.",
        "I thank God i got the tickets for free. Otherwise i thought this show was one of the worst i have seen in Vegas. The women were hott, but the overall performance was really bad. They tried to mix in comedy and singing as well. Just horrible show. I did see only three couples walk out.",
        "You could not stop me from 1 staring this company. I have said before a bad company can't hide. Worst customer service ever (agreed). Chronic problems with web mail unresolved after years!

Vote with your feet (by walking away).",

        "Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!",
        "This was our first stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",
        "So much for that groupon. Tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone.",
        "The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\\n\\nI can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?",
        "They need to find a better way of washing dishes. Our coffee cups had stains all over, cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over.",
        "Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "The people here were so friendly and helpful. The gun range was very clean and respectful. They were constantly cleaning the floors of shells keeping them out of our way and to keep us safe. The observation lobby was convenient and comfortable for the people in our party. They had a large gun selection. I don't like guns very much but I was very comfortable here.",
        "Checked this place out for the first time.  With the exception of it being very hot inside (had all the doors open no A/C) it was a really for a social area.  We didn't have food, only drinks so I can't comment on the food.",

        "I went there last night, cruising around on Parc looking for a place to get a quick pint. I was happy to discover this place! The inside was nice with couches and candles. Pool table. TVS all around, I noticed the terrasse had neon lights too great for summer time will probably go back then. \\n\\noverall fun time!",
        "One of my favorite places to go and grab a med plate. The med plates here (humus, tabouli, salad & dressing, pita bread) are by far the best in town. It does get busy pretty fast after 7 and parking can sometimes be a pain. When it is full and busy, it gets hard to hear anyone talking and it's almost like being at a club.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back. \\n\\nThe dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant.",
        "First timer here and I can't believe I actually paid $20 for a one day pass. Not even a free trial. Gym was super packed and machines were a good wait. Other than that, they've got every machine. This gym is OKAY.",

        "It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!",

A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.  This could become a regular in my lunch rotation....",
        "Good dumplings, though I wouldn't say they're the best ever. We enjoyed boiled, fried and soup dumplings. If you're looking for good and don't want to dent your wallet, this is the place. I'd suggest the owner try to keep the place a bit more clean... Just getting the grime off the windows/doors could improve the overall eating experience for patrons.",
        "Worst store ever!!! Puts expired wines on the shelf and will not refund. Four out of the five bottles of wine I bought in there have been no good.  The last one was so old the cork wouldn't even come out of it. I think they left it in the sun. Will never go back!!!",

Well it is 9:15 am and I am standing outside with my husband and kids and the doors are locked.

I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "What a HORRIBLE experience!  The dance floor was like a moshpit with angry, ugly people.  The lines at the bar were 5+ deep and not moving anywhere.  The layout makes it impossible to get from one area to another.\\n\\nThe ONLY upside is that on the outdoor patio there is a great view of the fountains at Bellegio and of the eiffel tower.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "Rude front desk clerk, Jack. Sounded annoyed when I called to complain about the room next door and their howling dog for the 2nd night in a row. Lame breakfast bar and the advertisement for a kitchen in the room is actually a tiny little door that has a mini microwave and mini refrigerator. No stove. Wouldn't stay here again even for free.",

        "Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.\\n\\nIt was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. \\n\\nI'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?",
        "The Sunday brunch is . It's served butler style (they bring the plates to the table). All the plates are absolutely delicious. They have bottomless drinks for an extra $20. It's a great deal and different experience compared to other buffets. It's for sure worth  a try.",
        "This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competition nearby I am surprised they stay in business here.",

        "James beard nominated chef, gourmet magazine says best Thai restaurant in north America, wine spectator award...All True and more.  Anyone who rated this place less than 4 stars needs to go back to panda express where you belong.  Incredible food, amazing wine list that's has some bottles of wine below retail.  Nothing else compares!!",
        "I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!\\nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!",
        "Had to kill some time waiting for a place to open.  Stopped in at apache and got a enchilada plate, red, cheese, actually white cheese that was melted.  I was shocked to be honest.  The sauce did seem to be tomato based which I'm not a huge fan of but it tasted pretty good.  Also at 6 bucks for that plate cheaper than most.",
        "Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "Great bagels, amazing pickles, and decent prices. The staff here is always friendly. The bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home. I love Chompies for breakfast. Try one of their eggs Benedict plates. You won't be disappointed.",
        "I just bought a house and needed my doors re-locked.  Called around 9:30 and Toby was there by 1:00pm.  He was courteous, professional and knowledgeable.  Would definitely recommend him to anyone needing a great locksmith.\\nThanks!",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "The Fountains of Bellagio. Something everyone visiting Vegas should have seen at least once.\\nThe show takes about 10 minutes, is FREE and runs every half hour right out fron the Bellagio Casino.\\nI like it best at night, along with the lights it's really beautiful, a nice stop while strolling the strip.\\nGreat photo ops, not to be missed!",
        "Most overpriced mediocre Asian food ever.  Everything tasted like something you could get at a fast food Chinese restaurant.  It's ridiculous that they charge $18 for a plate of vegetables and $28 for some rice porridge.  I don't understand why people even come here!  \\n\\nI would never choose to eat here if I was actually paying for it.",
        "The guys at this location have been really good to me for the car repairs that I have sprung on them on short notice. On another note if you buy tires from them they don't charge you for repairs on them. That is pretty sweet but they might try and nickle and dime you on petty stuff like license plate bulbs, I simply say thanks and change it myself.",
        "Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.",
        "I don't get it? Is this supposed to be delicious soul food? Its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks. The water is from the tap. I expected delicious, I got below average at best. Back to the real restaurants for me.",
        "had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!",
        "Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.",
        "Wow great find for my wife, son and myself while in town for a big 21st b-day party. The atmosphere is very upscale and the staff super friendly. The food really shines here - I like to cook Mexican food so I am very critical of how dishes are prepared. Every dish we ordered was wonderful - lot's interesting ingredients on every dish that played well on the palette. The corn bread they bring to the table is fantastic - best I ever have had.",
        "What a disappointment.  Saw on facebook that their fall produce stand was now open.  Arrived to a few buckets of greens, one box of potatoes, pumpkins and jars of salsa, butters and a few other things.  No one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us.  We could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to.",
        "We had the Travel Zoo coupon which gives you the app/entree/dessert. Ordered the combo app of course. Alligator was tough and so were the frog's legs. Crabcake was great. Gumbo is good. jambayala was great...Not quite New Orleans but pretty tasty. Atmosphere was nice and New Orleans looking. Large portions for the money.",

They exploit their employees in the Us and abroad.",

This location had Taro which a lot of locations don't have, so I filled my cup.  We also received a coupon for free 5 ounces, so we will be back.",
        "The challah French toast with fried chicken is amazing...until you come back. I've been there three times already, always asking for the same plate because I loved it. Then I have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next.",
        "Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it.",
        "Love this place. I didn't want to leave. Loved the push button curtains. Bell hops took a little to long to bring up the luggage but service was great. Check in was a little long. I loved looking down on the city strip from my hotel room way up. Especially with floor to ceiling windows. I will return again definitely.",
        "The store was really good but the restaurant was terrible, the food and the service were awful. I found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate.",
        "I am a Mediterranean food junkie!! Khoury's is really authentic Lebanese food which always satisfies my cravings. It is extremely delicious and addicting! I recommend the chicken kabob plate with hummus. The fatosh salad is amazing too! I've had problems in the past with slow service but they are very friendly which, for me, makes up for it. :)",
        "The guy working there was nice.\\nTheir food is not great at all.\\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.",
        "Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",
        "Absolutely fantastic !!!!! From the environment, the staff and the food, the gnocchi melt on your mouth. As you can see by my plate, I could have ate another dinner.",
        "eh. meh.  the fog of the casino did not divert my attention from the price tag of these generic fusion versions of chinese food.  the dim sum was actually pretty good, but everything else was sort of greasy and white-ified.  oh also, restaurants that don't have windows toward the actual outside sort of creep me out.",
        "There was a wendys. Thats it in my terminal worth mentioning.  Bathroom doors don't lock.",
        "Gag, they used an old bucket of water to wash down the inside, it reeked.  I had to drive home with the windows down.  Moldy old water and they wash the inside with that same rag for the tires.  Awful.  It's hard to find this place on the very South side of the shopping complex.  Skip it.",
        "IM NEVER GOING BACK Crooks.. no customer service and I spent three days there for the same issue. An issue I found after they said everything was good. 10 min from getting the job done they closed the doors after the 3 days of me waiting and wanted me to come back... We'll I'm not..... I'm going somewhere else",
        "Maybe it was because we were starving but I highly doubt it. This place is quite empty but the food was really good! It is served family style. I HIGHLY recommend the garlic noodles and the Stir Fry Chicken with Eggplant and Basil. I am dreaming of that plate currently. Best I've had hands down! Chicken Fried Rice was good -- not too greasy and flavorful.",
        "Price's may just be the best lunch value in Charlotte. Eight bucks bought me a lunch plate piled with a juicy pair of chicken wings, hush puppies and fries. Is it the best fried chicken in the South? How the hell should I know? But it's damn good food, and a local institution that'll kept you coming back again and again.",
        "My name is Jasen and I am a local Property Manager. I have worked with Mr. Lockout for almost 5 years and they have been complete life savers.

Carol and her team are there day and night whenever I need them. They have been a complete blessing!!!",
        "I love this place. We are staying at Paris and have gotten crepes for breakfast every day. My favorite is the Bananas Foster. So incredibly delicious! Some other reviewers have mentioned flimsy utensils and paper plates, but who cares, really? The crepes are the best!",
        "I was working inside the Venetian and went here for dinner with work associates after a long day. They offer gluten free pasta. It was good and convenient. Nothing totally amazing. They have a good and extensive wine list. I also had a bloody mary here a different day and it was delicious (we had a hard time finding bloodys in Vegas).",
        "Decent Cali-Mexi cuisine at reasonable prices. Don't come here expecting large plates, the servings are smallish. We've been a few times because a friend loves their bar-b-que tofu, and both their vegan(ish) burrito (the Green Burrito, if I remember correctly) and the Taco Salad with tofu were satisfying. Not outstanding, but consistent, with decent service.",
        "Pizzas are good and creative enough to be signaled, especially the Cochonaille et Gorgonzola. The possibility to have two halves of different pizzas is also enjoyable. Quite a nice spot for an outdoor diner on St-Denis street during the summer. \\n\\nAnd some waiters do look Italian.",
        "When I got to this place I was super stoked, the ambiance was amazing, service for sure is excellent. Food ? Outback is better not worth 100 buckaroos  per plate :) hey but I heard brunch is really good here I'll try it sometime:)",
        "Very disappointing!\\n\\n- Lasagna and agnolotti were tasteless\\n- Unpleasantly awkward waiter and bus boy\\n- Gorgonzola that came with the meat & cheese plate was amazing\\n\\nI'd put this restaurant on par with an Olive Garden. With so many other tasty places so close by, I wouldn't waste my time with Buddy V's.",
        "A very nice hotel/casino to look at. I haven't stayed here before, although I ate at the Grand Lux cafe last year. Very good food, although pricey. I've also been to the wax museum located on the Venetian grounds. \\n\\nI thought that my honey and I would do the Gondola ride thing when we went to Vegas a few weeks ago, but boo at the 65 dollar price tag for us to ride alone. I think not!",
        "The food here is ok to good but varies a lot. Serving tables are set too hot as are the heat lamps so food that's fresh from the kitchen is better than stuff that's been sitting. Salad table is fine as are the deserts.  And in any case it's considerably better than what I've been eating in Beatty for the last two days.",
        "Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \\\"yeah I know it's bad.\\\" \\nWon't be going back.",
        "I remember when I came here to try the Coca-Cola Sampler from around the world and oh my, some tasted very disgusting and others were very good. I wished they sold them in bottles so people are able to purchase them and keep it as a souvenir or drink it at a time of their choice. I wish to try their Float Variety Platter the next time I go to Las Vegas, I always buy bottled coke to drink in the hotel when I visit.",
        "Friend said he seen Guy from the food network do a show here, so we decided to come and check it out. Got here at 6:30am on the dot and ordered the Enchiladas,  the plate was very good and had good taste to it. \\n\\nWas expecting a bit more but wasnt bad.",
        "The best conference facilities I have been to in Phoenix.  Parking can get tight as another poster mentioned, but I think that is unavoidable.  The food is fantastic and they have snacks and drinks available during the day.  I don't like the tiny cups & water jugs to drink from.  I understand eliminating plastic bottles, but the cups they provide are too small.  Really a minor inconvenience though.",
        "Stay away! The food from the buffet is not worth ten dollars...I wouldn't eat it if it was free.As I write this I have a stomach ache after one medium size plate of food.",
        "Great food & fun atmosphere!\\nIt is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park.\\nmmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!",
        "I love giant clam, this place always has it fresh and crunchy,\\nDon't let them seat you in the front area where you walk in, sit in the back by the windows , the view is great !. \\nI, minus 1 star for the price here . Even with my local discount.",
        "Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\\n\\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\\n\\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \\\"let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\\\", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher.",
        "Trendy, dark, crowded.\\nWhen I think of Merc Bar, I think \\\"ehhh\\\"\\n\\nIt's not bad, just not great enough for me to remember it or frequent it on a regular basis.  \\n\\nThe drinks are spendy, but tasty.\\nThe sausage and cheese plate is good, but not memorable.\\n\\nEhh.",
        "Brand new. Stumbled into it Excellent execution on all plates. Roasted halibut, roasted broccoli soup, nice choices for charcuterie plate and interesting texture for shrimp and grits. Highly recommended.",
        "If you like Asian fusion, you can easily find  better place to go then Fugu. Food is way expensive and ok at best. But the biggest let down is the service. WOW! The server almost dropped the plate in our table and didn't crack a smile. We had to ask twice for a fork and no one even came back after delivering the food. Not worth the money neither it's a friendly place.",
        "Had a great breakfast here today. Their pancakes are wonderful! My daughter loved the Mickey Mouse pancake and ate nearly everything on her plate. My friend had the Eggs Benedict which they said was delicious and I tried the bacon, eggs, hash browns and pancakes all of which were very very tasty. Also the fresh squeezed orange juice is very good. Service is great too.",
        "I love any place that is amenable to the small plate, which this place does. My date and I got to share all of our courses. All of the flavors here were excellent. The primary criticism of this place is that the dishes came out lukewarm. Everything we tasted was excellent but not necessarily hot. The biggest disappointment on that front was receiving lukewarm goug\\u00e8res. Bread products (like soup) should always be piping hot.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "Great place. I would give it 5 stars if it were larger (and the lines smaller) and if the greeter/server's stringy black hair would have been tied up. It was dragging in the food as she bent over to put the plates on the table.  But I will be back!",
        "Sat outside with another couple and had a great dinner! Little pricey, but the quality of food was good. I love to share plates and this place is great for that!"

        "I've seen this restaurant change its face several times. This time I hope it stays this way. Both times we ordered carry-out, the servers were wonderful. Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. \\n\\nThe 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.\\n\\n I highly recommend this place.",
        "We were staying at the Luxor and figured we would try the buffet. Big mistake...the food was gross, there was not much of a variety, and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night. \\n\\nThe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive.",
        "This was a fun one time venture. Open bar but weak drinks and a less than accommodating bartender. The service at the Line - concierge however was so great! They helped me with my groupon and app...they gave me water and we're sweet to charge my phone!! We reserved the sunset time and the view is great..A must do for vegas newbies",
        "This place is horrible!!! Can't believe how they are still open!! We went for RW, and what a waste of money and time!!! The only up side was the service, our waiter was very attentive ... But the food was terrible!!",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "The effin service sucks!! All 3 servers were rude, never smiled and when I would ask for something they would just walk away.. I would never come back to this place.. Crab is so salty n what I said b4 SERVICE SUCKS!!!!",
        "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",
        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "Been coming here an average of once a week for overs year and got to know most of the staff and service is great! I'm treated very well and in the mornings after work I'm greeted with cheerful waiters eager to make my breakfast a great Denny's experience. Awesome customer service, I never had a problem with my order and this place is excellent in refilling my drink, will keep coming plus they proved free wifi for a geek tetchy gamer I am.",
        "Located inside Monte Carlo next to Dragon Noodles. They have a Sunday Red Sauce Dinner with 3 course dinner-salad, entree, dessert. It comes with free breadsticks and marinara sauce. The waiter was good on refills. Nice place to eat there for dinner.",
        "Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE",
        "Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks.",
        "Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!",
        "Coach Christa and Suzie are awesome with the Novice Girls! They are great at keeping the kids' attention and helping them progress! They have helped her in her confidence and patience!",
        "This is a fun place to gamble on the cheapo slots.  They have a lot of fun & interesting games that I had only seen at this property.  Don't expect a lot of waitress service, but if you want to bang away on some slots and be able to move to a lot of different machines in a couple hours, you can do it here right in the middle of the strip.",
        "So einen schlechten D\\u00f6ner hatte ich noch nie!\\nDie vorigen Bewertungen kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, sorry",
        "My husband and I were in the area and checked out local breakfast places on Yelp! They had good reviews so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away in one of those shopping centers, but is very cute and welcoming! The food was great and the coffee was hot! The servers were friendly and kept my coffee cup full! We aren't in this area often, but we will be back! :)",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "Please get courteous waitresses!  We dine there all the time in the evenings & those waitresses are kind & appear to be of Greek Nationality. Today we made the mistake & had lunch.  The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!",
        "Happy we have another bar in charlotte,  but have been there twice now and the wait for a drink does not make sense.  When you are paying a bartender $8 an hour and charging $8 dollars a drink do the math.  I wish you well, bit not sure I will go back.  Get it together guys.......",
        "Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.",
        "Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "Well.. This restaurant sucks! I wrote my name in a waiting list.. In that list, I have 2 party in front of me.. But after 15 mins of waiting the owner or server change my Que number to 5 for no reason. I think they give it to other people that he knows! Terrible.. Suck..",
        "Only saving grace was that the food was ok.    But wings did not come with carrots and celery as advertised.  Sandwiches didn't have tomato or lettuce.  Forgot my side salad and silverware.   Refills were slow and waiter smelled like smoke after disappearing for awhile.   No kids menus.  Bathrooms dirty and a in disrepair.     Skip this place.\\n\\nWaiter did comp drinks on the bill",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "Visiting from CA and my fellow traveler recommended we stop in here to pick up a few things. Nice layout and good prices.  My only complaint is the bananas were green.  I appreciate that at home so they last longer, but when wanting to eat one now it kinda sucks.  Matt the cashier was very friendly and cool as was the bag boy.  Nice place...he said it's family owned and operated.  Like it better than Sprouts which they have in SoCal.",
        "The service here is horrible. We couldn't get the attention of our waiter. The calm chowder was extremely salty, they took it back to replace it, but it seems like the just added water to the bowl......regardless, it was still salty! The food wasn't that good either. It seems like the chief had a bad day, so he/she wants to make ours bad too.",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "Overcrowded, overrated, overpriced tourist place in the Bellagio. Horrible, I mean HORRIBLE service.",
        "Terrible service, the food was okay. Restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food. We were literally the only customers.",

        "Beers and Bulls!\\n\\nWhat happens when you take drunk girls in hooker dresses and mount them on a mechanical bull?  Hilarity ensues, along with pantie shots.  Oh, and you don't have to walk through the casino to take a leak, cause the pisser (that's how cowboys say bathroom) is right there inside the bar!",
        "My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",
        "Typical Vegas cafe.  Nothing out of the ordinary except for our server Bobbie Jean.  She was super courteous, attentive, and sweet.  All servers should follow her example.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "Stopped here even though I'm way against anything to do with \\\"Sun Devils\\\".lol.  \\n\\nGreat beer selection of super hard to find brews. Even better wine selection downstairs and a laid back lounge. We stopped by and the wife had a glass of wine and I had a pint of Beer Republic beer. Great bartender downstairs with knowledge of beer and wine. I would totally come here to shop and have a drink downstairs in the lounge.",
        "Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.",
        "It's the bar in the center of the casino.  Open 24 hours.  Bartenders were hit or miss.  The best ones were usually late at night showing why they got the better shift instead of the 7am shift.  \\n\\nCheck in on Foursquare at Pour 24 and then go down the escalators to Center Bar and snag your free jello shot! Bonus!",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again.",
        "Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.",
        "Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it",
        "Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",
        "I have been here several times and they have never gotten my order right. I have never actually had something there that was cooked the way I ordered it. They even forgot the salad I ordered one time until the waitress brought the check. The last time I went my husband and I both got sick off the food. The atmosphere is fun, but that's about all it has going for it.",
        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",
        "the food there was ok...\\nBUT the place was dirty!! \\nthe service was ok but it was sooo dirty also with the waiter's top and pants, YUCK!",
        "I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food.",
        "Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.",
        "If you want hepatitis this is a place where you can get it! Totally disgusting from the food to the restaurant and the waiters. This whole place should be bombed with RAID!",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "My husband and I came after the D-backs came.  It was expensive and had a limited menu.  Food was ok, but how hard is it for a sports bar to have good wings.  Our waitress was kind of rude, when we commented on the limited menu she told us that we were free to go to TGI Friday's.  We will definitely remember to try that next time.",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "Well the price was good but I was expecting more... Not to many options and I didn't like the food it had no taste to it. The waiter took for ever to serve us refills and I really thought the place was amazing but in reality it let me down.. :(",
        "This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\\n\\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!",
        "Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure.",
        "Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.",
        "We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!",
        "A very different place than the usual club for Scottsdale. Speakeasy atmosphere was nice. Band was really good. That blonde haired girl could sing. Service was below average. Bartenders could not keep up. Waited 30 minutes for first drink. Then every drink after that involves trying to get wait staff to see you. Restrooms were dirty. Wouldn't take much to make this a really nice place. Manager s just need to hire a few more staff and keep the bathrooms cleaner.",
        "Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!",
        "Small, easy to navigate, a good middle-class hotel. Stayed in the \\\"Playboy Tower\\\" which was nice. Within walking distance to the Gold Coast and Rio, but not much else. Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM.",
        "Waiters are awesome and the food is great. I do wish the owner would allow you to order the \\\"la Potence\\\" beef tenderloin  medium instead of rare. Best dessert in town.",
        "My time is short, so I will be brief. The food is great here. The waitress I had was friendly. However, the prices are too high for people like myself who have to watch their spending.",
        "Chef John sucks at everything. Luckily for him Anna is a great bartender and is super hot.",
        "I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",
        "Atmosphere didn't bother me; when we showed up we were three of five white people in the place, the others looked terrified lol. Waitress didn't know what a Thug Passion was and then asked if we were looking for drugs. All that was fine because the music was good and people were having fun. But one weak-ass drink sent us packing. If you don't know how to make cocktails then maybe stick to beer and wine.",
        "Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.",
        "Kokimo's was way better. There were about six hostesses and 10 waiters plus 10 more bussers. Waiters seemed way too freaked out to spend time at the table. The did not seem confident. Almost like they would get in trouble if they talked too much to the table.  Atmosphere looks like a lower dollar BBQ joint. Need more options besides a regular steak I can get back home for less than half the price.",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America.",
        "I was in last Sunday for steak night.  The staff was amazing and the food was even better.  Props to Adam and Naomi for the way the handled the drunken baby shower party.  Looks like that baby is going to have a good home, when the parents do shots of patron and carry guns to bars, specially for a baby shower.  Oh yea and it was all over a balloon.  This kid is going to end up on Cops or Maury Pouavich",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!",
        "Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!",
        "Horrible. Ordered a blue cheese and bacon burger medium rare and got a well done, tasteless abomination. I had a better tasting, juicier burger at an airport Chilli's today.\\nThe sweet potato fries were only slightly better.\\nThe chipotle ketchup and \\\"burger sauce\\\" where very good.  \\nWon't go back and not recommended.",
        "The laziest service employees you will ever encounter.. They will thwart you right from the start, give you all the kinds of excuses not related to your car's complaint and problem just to reject the job..",
        "The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory",
        "The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!",
        "I tried the lunch buffet here a few weeks ago, and the food was pretty good.  We discovered the buffet on our last day in Vegas, after some horrible Studio Cafe experiences.  The flat daily rate seems like an excellent deal when you consider what you pay for food in Vegas.  The seating area was freezing for some reason, but our waitress was great.  She noticed that we were shivering and suggested coffee/tea, and she kept them refilled.",
        "Was lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \\n\\nFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.",
        "Service was average. Had to send steak back as it was crunchy on the outside. Potatoes Au Gratin seemed like something out of a box. Waitress brought another member of our party the incorrect wine. Valet took 45 minutes to get our car. In general, a disappointing experience. Won't be back.",
        "Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "Restaurant sympa, la nourriture est bonne et originale mais l'ambiance est un peu froide et le service impersonnel.",
        "It was around 6 pm dinner time and they were out of a lot of food.  I then decided to order something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu which is mostly breakfast sfuff.  I figure I can wait for them to cook something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu.  Well, the lady working said they weren't serving anything from that menu at that time.  Wtf????  Why do you have that on your menu then???  Get it together!!",
        "Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member."

        "Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!\\n\\nEveryone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious.  I ordered the ribs with chicken wings.  The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re-cooked yellowish color to it.  The ribs were too sweet.  \\n\\nThe server was very personable and had great social skills.  I appreciated  the service, but I wouldn't return here.",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",

I though you would only find a company like this in a small midwest town.\\n\\nAsh, the owner, is a great guy and answered all my question.  I had my front windshield replaced.  I was in and out of there in an hour.\\n\\nI highly recommend them for your auto glass repairs. I would give him 10 stars if I could!",

Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\\n\\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!",
        "Pleasant service and a good selection of cacti are available here.  I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti.",

There are lots of companies you can book  that are decent, it just depends on what you expect and your budget really of course!!",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",

The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \\n\\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal.",

I could drop a cool million in this mall and still want more.",

To me the best thing was the mash potatoes and Caesar salad.  Atmosphere was nice service was good but we will never go back again.  Definitely not worth 100 price tag.",
        "Its a laid back place for sure, with all the plusses and minuses that go with that. Crackerjack super-fast service? Dont count on it. Dusty in the corners. Seems to fly on auto pilot a lot. In any case, its the bar I go to the most... so go figure. Nothing quite like it.",
        "This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!",

        "No options for egg free hamburger bun!  Was told by the manager that all of the buns contain egg, so my son was unable to order a burger.  We opted to not eat here as a family, since they were unable to accommodate him.  Sad that restaurants are not willing to take allergens into consideration when creating the menu and offer options.",

The food that I did have was very good.  I was there for breakfast and the omelet station was appreciated.  I would be willing to return if I were walking through Caesar's and hunger hit me -- especially during breakfast time.",

        "Four stars only because I almost never give five...but this was definitely a really good lunch experience.  A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.  This could become a regular in my lunch rotation....",
        "The sushi was good.  The service was ok.  We couldn't keep track of who was serving us...there were so many coming and going.  We didn't like that different rolls we ordered were all coming at different times, instead of all at once.  We stayed at the Wynn so it was right across the street and we gave it a shot.",
        "Food was good...plenty of tv's to watch the game but we were served a mug of beer with lipstick on it and the idiot manager opened the glass wall with it being 100 degrees out to accommodate one outside table leaving all of us at the bar to sweat our a!#&* off.

        "So... it's a neighborhood place - nothing more, nothing less.  The service all depends on how busy they are - if they are slow, you can expect good service. If they are busy, not so much.

Between the pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan pesto chicken sandwich, Cosi offers tasty options for fast but warm meals without tasting cheap or unhealthy.  Me gusta.",
        "Ok. Here's the scoop. Loco moco was good, very good. RV pancakes without the chocolate, very tasty. I took to go orders of the banana pancakes. To try at the Volley ball tournament. The line can be outrageous for parties greater than 2. So waiting will be long.(expect up to 45 minutes)",
        "Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?",

Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",

Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices.  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich!!  Yikes.  We will not return.",
        "I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips. It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant. We never had a server come to our table. Waited 15 mins and nothing??? We did get chips, which were from a bag and not fresh. The salsa was also not very stellar. We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back",
        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company.",
        "I wasn't even in the restaurant for a full 10 minutes before I was denied service because my cousin went to use the restroom when we entered. Apparently you can't use the restroom here folks without the manager accusing you of being too drunk when in fact she wasn't even drinking. The manager had a major condescending attitude. FYI it wasn't even busy yesterday and they denied service to some very generous travelers. I didn't even know what to say. Awful.",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",

The manager just left some inexperienced person to do, without monitoring. If you want to get more business, please try to provide good service to all of your customers.",
        "Awesome AYCE sushi. They have egg custard which is my favorite. The only down side is its a little brown. But, still delicious. The sushi offered includes nigari and combo rolls. The buffet has both a hot and cold side offering salads and Chinese food. Dessert includes Thrifty ice cream. So good. The servers are very sweet and I have never had to wait for a refill.",

Would highly recommend!",
        "Would be a five star but the service was just bad. Waited over an hour for our meals.  Waitress was not too attentive.  Was served food without silver ware.  So why a 4 star because the food was very very hood.  The ribs were excellent.   Turkey nicely smoked.  Fries could have been more crisper.",

The owner of Hooters even stopped by to check on our table and he made us feel so comfortable and welcome! This was such a great family experience and the food was so delicious! I'd give it more stars if I could! I can't wait to come back & see all our new friends!",
        "\\\"It's a chain. It's fondue. BUT perfect for the right occasion. I would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates. You get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on. Pretty pricey however.\\\"",

The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients.   This place is directly south of the premium outlets.   We stayed parked and walked to Rick's Restorations, which is across the rail tracks from their parking lot.   This restaurant was featured on DDD.",

        "This review is based on food and drinks. Horrible service, mediocre product. If you decline the constant upsells they will ignore you. \\n\\nI'm sure it will do well due to its location and everyones willingness to support the club. As for the food and drinks so many better places worth exploring. I'm going to put this in the same category as Tao it will be fun to party at (anticipating) but better eating elsewhere.",
        "I've only been in Charlotte for a couple years and this is the first auto garage I've used down here. It's owned and operated by two brothers I believe. They did a great job and worked with me on the price. In the end I feel like they are a very reputable company that won't rip you off. I actually need to have some work done on my wife's car and plan on calling them to do the work.",
        "The food is excellent and the best part of the restaurant is that the patio is open now!  Well that may not be the best part, but it is a welcome addition.  The fish tacos are the best I've had and you can't go wrong with the dollar tacos.  If you're feeling adventurous, order a cabeza taco... It's awesome and after all for a dollar, what do you have to lose.",
        "New ownership.\\nIt is not Chicago-style pizza at all.  \\nThey didn't honor the $5 for $10 Yelp Deal I purchased.\\nWe ordered extra cheese pizzas to be delivered.  The pizza was mediocre, but the delivery was pretty fast.  I'd rather pick up a $5 Little Caesar's cheese pizza than order from them again.  \\nUnimpressed, but not disgusted.",
        "From the outside, with all the lights I was expecting more. It's fun  if you want to kill time and walk around looking at cheap gifts.  Lots of security throughout shop, and you cannot carry any large bags in the store.  They will take them from you and you can pick up when you exit building.",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",

        "Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \\\"delicious\\\" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!",
        "A Vegas must!  TV's everywhere, stadium seating and great food!  We LOVE our \\\"Texas connection\\\" bartender Daina. She is such a sweetheart and will make sure you have a great experience.  Without question the best sports book on the strip.",
        "Max Brenner is known for sweet offerings, so I had this preconception about the savory dishes being less than satisfactory.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  The mushroom and steak quesadilla was surprisingly good.  Nice crispy crust with quality ingredients packed inside.  The hazelnut chocolate shake was wonderful.  \\\"The works\\\" chocolate pizza had good chocolaty taste without being too rich.  The marshmallow on top provided good mouth feel.",
        "I loved the way everything was served at the buffet.   Most things were portioned off so you could share with a friend or try everything without feeling guilty about leaving it over if you didn't like it.  The crab was wonderful, but the most impressive thing was the dessert bar.   It all actually tasted as good as it looked.   Worth every penny.",
        "We cannot say enough good things about Erik and his crew. There is no comparison between The Careful Move crew and any other moving company. They moved our whole house of high end furniture and art from Las Vegas to San Diego without any damage. They made three separate trips to complete the move.

They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF.",

        "Aaaaahhhhhhhh! I walked into this place happy, and instantly turned into hipster emo girl. what is going on? The music is really sad and there are a lot of flies around. Get me outta here. The coffee and treats are always good though.",
        "This place is great. We purchased the smoked prosciutto, hard salami, and peperoni when we stopped in. The counter staff was very friendly, despite being VERY busy, and made some excellent recommendations. \\n\\nNext time I'm going to add a selection of cheeses to my purchase of cured meat."

I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!",

I went in with black dress pants and got old man hair blown on my pants multiple times. the haircuts seems alright, but understaffing makes the wait beyond annoying.",

Never will I go back to this place.",

The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",

She also told me what to tell my nail salon back home if I wanted to fill it.",

We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food, man? Good pizza, but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better.",

Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",

You physically must be in his or her narrow line of sight and directly in front of their register or else in their world you physically do not exist.  In other words very poor customer service.",

Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.",

After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back.",

Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM.",

I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

There were a few hits - the caviar fried egg dish was amazing as well as the crispy pasta with aioli and shrimp, but the octopus was inedible and everything else was just ok.  I expected to be wowed but walked away having spent $300 and it was just ok.",
        "i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!",
        "This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself.",
        "Atmosphere didn't bother me; when we showed up we were three of five white people in the place, the others looked terrified lol. Waitress didn't know what a Thug Passion was and then asked if we were looking for drugs. All that was fine because the music was good and people were having fun. But one weak-ass drink sent us packing. If you don't know how to make cocktails then maybe stick to beer and wine.",
        "Love this service.   I use it about once a month to PHX and often on the other end of my flights too if I am not renting a car.   Always on time, always courteous.   I use them for business trips mostly, easy online booking even for same day a couple hours in advance.   If I need them sooner than that I usually call...have never had an issue.",
        "they charge a 10% restocking fee. The employees will not tell you about it till you bring the item back, even if you ask about the return process.",

        "It's in a perfect location and has great decor.  I love that you can go on the roof.  That will be awesome in the spring and summer.  It's kind of a hassle getting in there especially if you're a guy, and the bouncers have a tendency to be rude.  The drinks are a little too expensive for me ($8 for a beer ...) so I usually get my drinks somewhere else then stop by Commonwealth for the cool vibe.",

        "Tiffany was excellent! my review is soo super late but she really took care of my nails! She did the crystals on them and everything I was so thrilled and felt totally VIP when she took care of me immediately. I have never felt so un-rushed or pushed into anything in my life! Ask for Tiffany She is AMAZING!!",
        "I would rated minus 5 if i could, stay away from this place specially this person named Kimberly she is awful she chopped my hair off way far from what i've asked to at the end there was no haircut and she told me: \\\"the less you wash your hair, the better it will look\\\" i needed it dirty!! I SHOULD'VE CUT MY HAIR AT HOME CAUSE THIS PLACE AIN'T WORTH IT!",
        "We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!",
        "The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory",
        "This place has the best breakfast burrito in town! They're a little on the pricey side but well worth the money and on some days (Sunday?) they're a dollar off. Everyone who has ever taken my order has been polite and friendly. I want to try something else on the menu but the breakfast burrito is too good to pass up!  Love this place!",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "It's Walgreens.  Generally they are all the same.  However, I will say the pharmacy staff here is very good.  They are helpful, friendly, and seem to be efficient in filling prescriptions.  They also are good answering questions about non-prescription products.\\n\\nThere are probably two other Walgreens convenient to either my home or office, and another two or three CVS.  This tends to be my first choice of them all.",
        "Had the worse nail experience here. I asked for a nail trim and a fill. The woman cut off some of my skin said \\\"sorry\\\" and passed me off to someone else. Wtf?! Definitely not going back!",
        "I had high hopes for this place when I decided to make reservations here for my fiance's birthday. We had walked past this place many times and always said we'd try it one day. The potatoes au gratin were delicious. Otherwise the rest of the food we ordered was all right, but nothing that I'll be dying to try again.",
        "The veggie burger here is ok, I enjoyed the appetizers more.  We had cheese sticks and fried pickles.  The atmosphere is interesting--mocking, faux retro-Soviet culture.  I guess I need to explain the two stars--if I go to a place that specializes in burgers and they offer a veggie burger I expect it to be something memorable, not two garden burgers in a large bun that I can get pretty much anywhere else.",
        "I waited for an hour to get my hair highlighted I had previously called and said I was coming in and then it was my turn to be next and they took somebody else in front of me and told me to wait another 20 minutes.",

        "OMG Yelpers - thanks so much for your recommendations - we were in Vegas for the weekend and didn't want to eat on the Strip. We drove out to this place for dinner because of all of the Yelp reviews and it was fantastic. Everything was delicious and authentic (and spicy!) and the service was great too. We cannot wait to come back - yay!",
        "We walked in on a Sunday morning, we're seated immediately. The wait staff were excellent, as was the food.  We had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another table-no problem.  Some of the best service I have had in recent years in Vegas-sweet!",
        "Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.",

        "Ok so I came back here the other day, for nostalgia more than anything, and I realised that the seats are more of a novelty than anything else. Don't get my wrong, I LOVE Baguette Express, but it's always so busy and you must save about 15 minutes for queuing, particularly in this branch!!",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "Ribeye steak was so salty I could not eat it. To make it worse they did not take it off the bill.  So I ate $100 dollars worth of mac an cheese which was not very good either. My friend had the filet which was ok. I would not suggest this place to anyone.  The only thing good was the bread.  We did not see our waiter after he served us for 35 minutes when he asked if I wanted a desert since I could not eat the steak.",
        "Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???",
        "Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware",
        "I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.",
        "The sales approach at this place is nothing short of a Used Car lot.  Three gentlemen fought over shaking my hand as I walked through the door and everything went downhill from there.",
        "Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced...I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.",
        "I didn't eat here, just walked in and tried to sit down at lunch time. The people were nasty so we walked out. Plus there's a $50 minimum per person. Gotta give it to 'em - they went all the way with the ridiculous minimum.",
        "Service needs some improvement.Sushi was terrible ! Lacked freshness and most of all flavor...they tasted the same or it was blasted with spice so you could not savor ask the different flavors. I eat sushi regularly....know good and promise me..save you're monies and go elsewhere. if you're an experienced sushi eater you will be disappointed",

        "Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon.",

I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",

Based on two visits with our family I doubt we will return as there are too many high quality options in Charlotte. \\nAlso -- avoid the Sunday brunch!!  Food was variable and not worth the price.

The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients.   This place is directly south of the premium outlets.

Good shopping mall restaurants to avoid.",

The service was really slow (we waited around 15 minutes for the check), I think because it was St. Patrick's Day she was a bit overwhelmed, but I definitely want to go back to try more items. Especially their Sangria. ;)",
        "So time for an update, :D The staff definitely stepped it up which is a bonus. They greet you as soon as you're in the door. I ordered the Wellness drink again and YES it was blended but, I just can't knock it, it is DELICIOUS and still healthy also. Didn't order food but, I'd go back for the smoothies they are worth every penny",
        "i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.",
        "Food was good but I was quite surprised when my Gin Martini got delivered and the lemon twist floating in it still had the sticker from the grocery store/orchard...clearly the bartender that peeled the twist and rimmed the glass with it, as well as the server that brought it didn't think twice about the fact that there was blatantly a large sticker that said, \\\"Sunkist\\\" floating in the drink as well",

The food is pretty good, the shrimp and grits are very spicy, the veggie melt is heavenly, and the biscuits with berry jam is so special I could eat them daily.  That being said, the hit or miss service will probably keep me away for awhile.......hopefully when I decide to return they will have the service issues corrected.",
        "This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4).",
        "These cupcakes can be hit or miss.  There are certain items like the chocolate peanut butter which  can really cause addiction, while there are others like the key lime, and red velvet which taste like any other key lime or red velvet cupcake.  These cupcakes are seriously expensive and there is always a pretty large line to get one.  With those two things in mind I am not so sure that its worth the trip. That is unless you are already addicted to a certain flavor.",

The waitress acknowledged us, brought us 2 out of the 3 drinks we ordered and then she never came back to our table.  After 15 mins we got up and left.  I would leave a 1 star but I reserve that for blatantly rude or disgusting places.",

        "I popped in to have a quick lunch and quite enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The salmon was cooked perfectly--a little extra pink in the middle. I am docking one star because I think my meal was a touch overpriced. $28 for 5 asparagus spears, a beer, about 7 oz salmon, and about a cup of grits. Seems like island prices to me! Was tasty though.",
        "We picked up some combination pad Thai on our way home tonight and it was super disappointing. No peanuts, no lime, bright orange sauce, almost no bean sprouts, lukewarm. My boyfriend isn't crazy about spice so we went with a level 2 heat which was more like what I would expect from a 3+ level and was definitely pushing his limits. Definitely won't be going back.",

        "I like this place for lunch. It is relativley inexpensive, and healthy as you can get a wrap and side (choice of soup, pasta salad, or fruit) for about $7. Everything there seems fresh, they have quick service and a unique dinning and patio area. My favorite wrap is the buffalo chicken and I would reccomend it to everyone.",
        "Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?",

I don't know, but it tasted awful and certainly wasn't steak. I don't know what qualifies them to be a Mexican restaurant, but I was not impressed. Your best tip will be to skip this place.",
        "I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \\n\\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.",

The peach cobbler had scant canned peaches, what tasted like store bought commercial ice cream with powdered cinnamon dumped on top.

My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",

        "Very good, excellent sides, tasty food.",
        "Ordered a Red Dragon (minus the Crab mix add additional Spicy Tuna) (Great - this one was my Favorite) and the Tuna Lovers (Good) - the fish was fresh and both rolls were very tasty! I'll be back!",
        "It's the bar in the center of the casino.  Open 24 hours.  Bartenders were hit or miss.  The best ones were usually late at night showing why they got the better shift instead of the 7am shift.  \\n\\nCheck in on Foursquare at Pour 24 and then go down the escalators to Center Bar and snag your free jello shot! Bonus!",
        "Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick.",
        "Good strong fresh coffee. Cool but still friendly staff. Unhurried vibe. Super cute decor. Love it here",
        "Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!",
        "We ate here last\\nMinute. This was the only place open late on a Sunday and I'm glad that we ended up\\nHere. The vibe is modern and comfortable. Very spacious and the food is more than bomb. The Lisa Lisa roll is a must! I would definitely eat here again esp since I visit monthly.",
        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",
        "Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.",
        "The wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 1/2 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  (we laughed)",
        "Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.",
        "Really enjoyed the food and service. Delicious ribs and brisket. Mac & cheese was different, but very tasty. The owners were extremely attentive and friendly. Very reasonable prices...four of us ate for less than $40. Go try it out and support a local business",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \\\"made in the 70s\\\" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.",
        "Went a while back for my birthday with four friends.... Great place for group because you can try more items.  So we tried virtually every app, the egg was the best and fries were okay when compared to the egg.  Elk ribs were outstanding and grits below I still dream about.  Wine was plentiful. Desserts were good but over shadowed by the rest of the meals highlights!",
        "i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again.",
        "Love the personal training sessions, classes and the friendly ambiance! Best way to get fit instead of a regular gym! Always leave here sweating and stronger!",
        "I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!",
        "Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!",
        "This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that.",
        "The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3:23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4:00 AM. \\nLike many who come here for conventions - this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work - and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.",
        "I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it.",
        "Asado is a great hangout!  Good food and drinks.  The menu is full of very tasty choices. I like the feel of a Mexican Hacienda meets High Tech.  Cool place with good food!  I live in the area and felt like I was at my own Casa! Only thing missing was my pool!",
        "I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!",
        "Carne asada meat was dog food quality--simultaneously fatty and tough.  The woman who took my order had trouble communicating in English.  And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo.",
        "The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.",
        "Horrid.  Not told about an 'additional driver fee' when a 2nd was added at the desk upon arrival and car wasn't vacuumed or cleaned..  Be prepared to be charged $10 extra per day if returned early also. Gave them a 1st time shot but not worth the hassle, rent elsewhere.",
        "Located in The Fremont Hotel Casino on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas. I went for breakfast. I hate to give a bad review. One word Yikes!  The selection was scant. I had a danish, I am not saying it was stale, but I wanted dessert not a weapon. There is better and cheaper in Las Vegas. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",
        "Yes, I love Bobby Flay and most things food network.  I love this place.  The scallops are so good!  The tamales are so good. The steak is so good. I am not very good with spicy things.  Actually, I am a huge wimp.  But, there is plenty on the menu for wimps. And it is just all sooo tasty!",
        "Awful. Simply awful. The bread was stale, the meat was old..  The service wasn't great and the place was empty.  What a horrible experience - Emeril should be ashamed to have his name on this place.  Three of us were there and we had the pastrami sandwich and it was very disappointing. I will not return.",
        "Lived here for 7 years and been meaning to check this place out. Went on Wednesday AM, seated right away. Waitress was great transplanted New Yorker..\\nOnly complaint was the blueberry muffin while large was scarce on the berries. Other than that, had eggs, ham and hashbrowns which were tasty.\\nCoffee was good. Tasted some different than the water served most places. Service was excellent!",
        "I went to Ground Control for the first time last night and I was unimpressed. The food was pretty good but the service stinks. They need some mature staff who can take care of their patrons, not the young kids playing kissy face with their girlfriend at the bar.  The cheeseboard for $14.00 was less than impressive with a couple of slices of cheese and a few nuts and dates. I think I will pass next time.",
        "I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.",
        "Tiffany was excellent! my review is soo super late but she really took care of my nails! She did the crystals on them and everything I was so thrilled and felt totally VIP when she took care of me immediately. I have never felt so un-rushed or pushed into anything in my life! Ask for Tiffany She is AMAZING!!",
        "They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...",
        "Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat- great value. Staff very friendly, and kind. Service was moderately quick. Go there in the early hours of meal time to get the best service times.\\nWARNING- don't order too much of the rolls- they have huge servings.",
        "Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!",
        "What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again",
        "CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!",
        "Best food in Vegas. All natural, fresh, healthy, and tasty!",
        "Wow, harsh reviews!\\n\\nI found the guy behind the counter helpful.  He steered me in the right direction and I got a meal I really enjoyed.   BBQ'd tilapia and Chicken Adobo were very tasty.",
        "Note to self DON'T take super shuttle when needing to get to airport!!!!! Late & Lost...WTF",
        "I Came here to watch the Soccer WorldCup, they have beers I have never heard of at good price and taste good...great service..and everyone was friendly, didn't know anyone and met good people and ya Colombe(blonde.tall.photograph.cutie) lol but she left a bit early ....",
        "I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "Tasty food and friendly staff. Been coming here a few years. The prices have risen lately, but still within my budget for Indian food.",
        "If you want Denny's quality food for 3x the price, eat here. I got the ham and cheese omelet which was exactly that - egg, ham and cheese for $15. \\n\\nbottom line: the food will hit the spot for late night (or should i say early morning?) cravings, but you might only want to dine here if no other options are readily available.",
        "Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!",
        "Kate and I recently held our wedding at the Orpheum (ceremony and all) and it was fantastic. The service, the food, the setting were all something special. \\n\\nHats off to an excellent event coordinator, a helpful bar staff and some very tasty scallops (even if I was too busy to actually eat one).",
        "Both times ive been here the appt. are late. Both about 20-30 minutes late. Of course its because they are busy....i love getting here at least 10 minutes early only to wait an addition 30 minutes past my appointment time ti be called back..",
        "Really really enjoyed watching this show. The music is just so dreamy and the theatre is so beautiful. I think we saw it some time last year, so this post is quite late. However, in any case, my love and I had an amazing time. Can't wait to go back to Vegas and see more shows!",
        "Magpie is a great little Pizzeria located on MaGuire just above fairmount\\n\\nTo begin their MagPie Bloody Caesar is amazing\\nI started with their meatballs and Caesar Salad, again both were really good\\n\\nTheir Pizzas are HUGE 1 is enough for 2 people, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, I had Prosciutto it was delicious\\n\\nPrices are reasonable but space is limited so get there early or make reservations",
        "Sitting at the bar is always my favorite spot. Great TVs and they are always on some good sporting event. Sliders are tasty, fries are the way they should be and drink pours can be generous depending on who's bartending.\\n\\nThe patio is a nice little spot but can get a bit smoke filled depending on the night of the week. But they do have plenty of heaters out there so that is definitely a bonus!",
        "We stopped in after Showstoppers. They tried to charge us $10.00 cover even though we were there before 9:00pm time when they start charging and if we were buying drinks. Then the young lady say even Mr. Wynn pays, I'm sorry I don't care I'm not going to pay you $10.00 cover to buy a bottle of wine. So I took my business else where. Thank you",
        "I didn't wanna write a review but since 2 days late ,still feeling bad from the clam pizza....I'd have to say this place is no good.",
        "Dualing Piani....er, pianos! Need I say more? Not to busy early in the week but standing room only on weekends! Good drinks, no food, and the perfect place to go with a crowd. Get there early though, or your crowd will be standing most of the night.",
        "Great mexican fare, absolutely tasty and well executed. Great for lunch, not sure I would have dinner there, in the Canal Shoppes mall, unless you really want to see and hear the gondoliers on and on. A bit pricey for classic mexican food, no matter how good, so rating is set  at 3.",
        "Not very good. My friends and I were hungry, and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find. All five of us felt like our burgers were dry, when we ordered medium, and that the buns tasted borderline stale. We all left unsatisfied.",
        "I was in town for a business meeting and looked on yelp for a good place to eat, Solo did not disappoint! Great service and delicious beers as well as a yummy pizza! My co worker and I split a cheese and meat appetizer which was also very tasty! It's a family business and we even got to talk to them, very nice and helpful! Recommended highly!",
        "So simple. So good. Why can't every city just have a Cosi by now?  Or at least Milwaukee; that'd be perfect.  Having been here a couple of times now, I consider myself a fan.  Between the pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan pesto chicken sandwich, Cosi offers tasty options for fast but warm meals without tasting cheap or unhealthy.  Me gusta.",
        "The roasted half chicken = GREAT! The mashed potatoes & green beans were very good, as well. The stuffing was good, but could have been better in flavor. The service was great. The bread options & Caesar salad was delish, as well. No complaints, really. The environment of the restaurant was nice - I love the level of privacy in the booths. The bar environment was very moody, dark, and retro - divine!",
        "If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",
        "The experience was perfect.  The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive.  The food was stellar.  We had the crab cakes to start, yum!! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty.\\n\\nHighly recommended!",
        "Great place to shop at, a lot of different stores to choose from.  Parking is fairly easy, especially when it's not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days.",
        "Ok. Here's the scoop. Loco moco was good, very good. RV pancakes without the chocolate, very tasty. I took to go orders of the banana pancakes. To try at the Volley ball tournament. The line can be outrageous for parties greater than 2. So waiting will be long.(expect up to 45 minutes)",
        "Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?",
        "We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??",
        "Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \\\"etiqueccy\\\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",
        "Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.\\n\\nThe crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless.",
        "Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\\n fries are worth the add-on",
        "This club is really cool, great place to take your girl for drinks and still be able to talk to her. Cheap to get in, elevator ride up is fun because you see the whole strip up. The view from the club itself is amazing, drinks are pricey but well made and strong. Must check it out.",
        "so basic. so loud. so dark. so packed. ugh and regulars sitting on the bar? really? like, 2 dudes, literally SITTINGG on the bar. i dont care who youre \\\"bro\\\" is, im trying to get a drink here. take off your too cool metal mulisha tee and let someone else enjoy a song or two .. before i get the heck out of here.",

Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. \\n\\nThe 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.\\n\\n I highly recommend this place.",
        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "I like this place. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot. It's a Charlotte institution, and the food is very good. The only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft... not thick as expected. Still good.",
        "The crepes were very dry (overcooked), the mushrooms tasteless and unsliced.\\nThe crepes have no finesse.\\n\\nWhile the service was good, the food was pathetic.\\n\\nAvoid this place.",
        "The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed.",
        "I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",
        "Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "Pretty disappointing. Waited in line for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLow quality food.  Tough prime rib.\\n\\nSushi was disgusting. Very fishy.  Prepared in advance and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard. California roll and cucumber roll?  I thought this was a high end buffet. Where are the fish rolls?\\n\\nI've had comparable food at a Denny's.",

        "The peanut butter & jelly cake was served hot. So the peanut butter was runny and the cake was really dry & hard. You couldn't taste the jelly until you got into the center of the cake. Warm grape jelly isn't too great to eat. The latte tastes like any other latte.",

Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",
        "I love that this salon provides a shuttle! It's very clean and friendly. The amount of colors to chose from is quite impressive!

Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!",

The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.",

        "For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "It was a great hotel. It's not luxury but it was very quiet and clean. The staff was nice and very helpful, I would stay here again. You are around the corner from the strip so it's perfect and a mile from the convention center. It's super cheap too, can't beat it.",

Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "The food was horrible. I ordered the Red, White and Blue Slam with a side of bacon. The blueberry pancakes tasted like they were reheated in the microwave and dry, the bacon was burnt, refried and full of grease and my plastic cup of water had brown stuff stuck at the bottom. This is my first and last time here.",

        "I am really disappointed overall-overpriced for portion of chips which looked like soggy potatoes (not very clean either-they should change the fryers more often). I have been ask to pay extra for mayo?! Really????",
        "Been going there for years.  Sadly, after the manager left, this place has gone down hill very rapidly.  It is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly.  I can't possibly recommend them to anyone if they can't keep good help around there. So long...",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.",
        "Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty. \\nService was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do. \\nThere was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown. \\nWould never be going back....",
        "Tho Pho here is great! Broth tastes almost good as Pho So 1 :)\\nthe restaurant is very empty around 4pm. (Maybe that is the only reason they have times to keep the place very clean all the time lol ) \\n\\nGood place!",
        "Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get.",
        "Picked up a Pizza tonight and it was terrible. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I made sure to be there at that time.  The box seemed warm but not hot.  I didn't really think about it though until after I tasted it.  For almost $18 this should of at least been hot. The crust was chewy not crisp at all.  Not worth it.",
        "These are definitely the best cheesesteaks outside of Philadelphia!  \\n\\nI am not sure why the reviews aren't that good other than the reviewers must not know what a true Philly cheesesteak is supposed to be.  Believe me, I grew up in PA, so I have eaten my fair share of Philly cheesesteaks.\\n\\nThe restaurant are clean, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious!",
        "Ka did not live up to my expectations. I've always heard of Cirque shows being the \\\"must see\\\" in Vegas however, after experiencing a few I would be more inclined to tell people to skip it. About 20 minutes in to the show after the initial amazement had worn off I was bored and ready to leave. I'm sure this is some people's idea of entertainment, definitely not mine.",

        "The people here were so friendly and helpful. The gun range was very clean and respectful. They were constantly cleaning the floors of shells keeping them out of our way and to keep us safe. The observation lobby was convenient and comfortable for the people in our party. They had a large gun selection. I don't like guns very much but I was very comfortable here.",
        "Just opened, I will give them them the benefit of the doubt cause there other counterpart on charleston, not as good service could be better, layout is nice, ordered the burger, fries where great burger was burnt on the outside despite ordering med well, either they over used a blow torch or didn't clean the stove.",
        "Great new frozen yogurt spot! There is a lot of choices here! you make your own selection of yogurt and choose from a wide variety of toppings.  The seating  area had some fancy space cadet chairs but not enough chairs and tables for the amount of customers.  Over all Oh Yogurt was a very clean and inviting place to enjoy a cool treat!  I would recommend to others  to try and I would definitely return.",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "Had the Fried Chicken it was cooked to perfection hot, crisp and juicy! The crew was friendly and accommodating all food cooked and prepared to order. Service was fast and friendly . If they are on your area give them a try you won't be disappointed !",
        "It's a kool spot I guess.. But I've been going there for a few yrs now and the staff is great but the food is good at best but not great and this place is slowly getting worse.. Bathrooms are never clean if you show up at 7am but wish them well but I've given more than enough money to this place and its not getting better.. Sorry guys",
        "Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch: sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",
        "My wife and I stayed here during our Spring Training trip.\\nThis place is a little run down but good enough for spending  a few days. Close to Diablo stadium.\\nThe reason this is 3 instead of 4 stars is housekeeping. Our room wasn't ready until after 4 pm and each day housekeeping left a little to be desired.",
        "By far the worst car wash I've used. My car ended up worse coming out. I had to go to the gas station next door to wipe down my windshield since there was soap streaks all over it. It looked like my car was rained on and left to dry. Save yourself the time.",
        "Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back. \\n\\nThe dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant.",

        "Great selection of toppings and yogurt! Super clean friendly atmosphere the only place I will get yogurt from.  Do yourself a favor and go get some!",
        "Carne asada meat was dog food quality--simultaneously fatty and tough.  The woman who took my order had trouble communicating in English.  And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo.",
        "Took my 15 month old there yesterday & he loved it! It's a very clean environment. My husband & I loved that there was a wide variety of activities & toys. Highly recommend this place and the price is $12 for an all day pass. Definitely will be returning",
        "My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \\nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.",
        "Horrid.  Not told about an 'additional driver fee' when a 2nd was added at the desk upon arrival and car wasn't vacuumed or cleaned..  Be prepared to be charged $10 extra per day if returned early also. Gave them a 1st time shot but not worth the hassle, rent elsewhere.",
        "Awful. Simply awful. The bread was stale, the meat was old..  The service wasn't great and the place was empty.  What a horrible experience - Emeril should be ashamed to have his name on this place.  Three of us were there and we had the pastrami sandwich and it was very disappointing. I will not return.",
        "Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and well kept spaces for the pets. Ive been a pet owner/ foster parent my entire life and this is one of the overall best shelters i have been too. Highly recommend finding the new addition to your family here :)",
        "Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!",
        "Great big Tostones, very nice hot sauce and mojo! Everyone at my table (two who had never had Cuban food) all cleaned their plates :)",
        "Good dumplings, though I wouldn't say they're the best ever. We enjoyed boiled, fried and soup dumplings. If you're looking for good and don't want to dent your wallet, this is the place. I'd suggest the owner try to keep the place a bit more clean... Just getting the grime off the windows/doors could improve the overall eating experience for patrons.",
        "Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!",
        "We always get meat here when it has yellow tags. Saving money. Also I drop off my proscriptions and pick up later. They will send you a text when ready.",

        "Food very good ,place very clean",
        "I just found this place over the weekend and stopped in for lunch. This place is a New York style deli with all of the favorites; Pastrami, Corned Beef, Stuffed Cabbage Rolls, bagels, NY style cheese cake, egg creams, and the list goes on and on. This place is large for a deli, clean, great service, priced right, and generous portions. Try the bagel chips.",
        "Not impressed! The meats were very salty! No refills on soft drinks! The filet was really dry! We were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasn't comped? Extremely over priced!!!!! \\nNot worth your money! I went to the fiesta casino buffet and paid $6.99 and had better cuts of beef than here!!!!",
        "This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again.",
        "Had the Beef Bulgogi box and ordered sides of the kimchi.   WORSE BULGOGI I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Dry and no taste.  VERY VERY VERY Disappointed.  Will never eat here again",
        "Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue.",
        "Was in the area and looking for Guacamole mix so I stopped in here to see if I could find some.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any, so I left and went to the Vons on Lake Mead & Buffalo.\\n\\nThe store was clean, but the parking lot is a disaster.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 33%",
        "My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).\\n\\nAll attractions/games were in good working condition.",
        "The old Aladdin revamped! We stayed in the Resort Suite w/ a Jack Nicholson theme. Large enough to room 5 girls - great view of the Bellagio fountains right below, HUGE bathroom, clean, and friendly front desk staff! Conveniently connected to the miracle mile shops. I usually stay at the Venetian but this place is great for those on a budget -. inexpensive room rates if you're a player/AAA member.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "This Starbucks is very close to work so very convenient. I absolutely adore this English lady with her even more adorable English accent!!! I love it when she takes my order. Every once in a great while I get a drink that's not mine but they offer a replacement and if I want a free one for next time. Friendly, clean and great service. \\\"Can't get that with satellite!\\\"",
        "The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom.",
        "These were the best tacos on the east side that I've had. Very authentic and inexpensive. Nice people and the place is very clean. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur\\u00e9ed. I like it chunky. But that is no bug deal. I HIGHLY recommend people to try this place.",
        "Mediocre sports bar. The place is clean and looks nice, but honestly there is nothing that really sets it apart from any other place around town.\\n\\nOne issue I have is the lack of selections for someone that eats vegetarian/vegan. Even some pretzel bites or hummus would be nice.",
        "I guess I was expecting more.  The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good.  But I guess growing local and being \\\"fresh\\\" come at a cost.  Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive.  It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.",
        "Be prepared to spend the day. There's an amazing amount of info and it's well presented.",
        "I ordered a regular(7\\\"-$6.95) Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to go. It has grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapenos and extra cheese. It was really good. The bread wasn't even soggy and it took me 20 minutes to get home!",
        "I concur with several other customers commenting on the owner. We frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner, that was it for us.  Unpleasant and Rude is an understatment. It's not the way we want to spend a nice evening.",
        "Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.",
        "Let us check in at 9am, friendly staff.  Decor a bit old, but very clean.  Looking forward to our stay",
        "Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!",
        "Was in need of a serious hair cut and beard trim and my brother recommend that I go here , Freddie was the barber who cut my hair and everything came out clean ! great service , great vibe, definitely will be coming back to this barber shop , would really recommend to anyone , these guys know what they are doing !",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "Wow first time in a while and this place is a mess kinda disgusting...kid was too busy counting the tips\\n\\nPreviously there used to be a girl who I would always see working here that kept the spot super clean...all I can say is if I were the health department they wouldn't get an A grade today",
        "Reasonably priced and delicious this is THE dumpling house of China-town!\\n\\nLarge variety, and always savory - definitely worth the stop. You can also make your own dipping sauce from the traditional ingredients at the table.\\n\\nYou have every meat option - veggy, shrimp, pork, beef etc"

        "This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.",
        "Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure.",
        "I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me.",
        "Excellent service. Noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent. Very nice staff and decent prices considering the location.  I don't think I would come back again but I am glad that I tried it.",
        "Went for lunch on a Living Social deal.  WOW!  We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "Calamari was ok, breaking was that crispy but overall it was good.  Ordered New York style because it was the special.  Not impressed with the crust. Usually the crust is nice and crispy.  This time it seemed like there was too much sauce because the crust was soaked and chewy.  Sauce and cheese were good.  Still hasn't swayed me. Metro is still totally worth it.",
        "Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!",
        "Cute shop with an old-timey feel to it. The popcorn is housed in these really nice wood and glass cases.\\n\\nUnfortunatley, it is not worth going out of your way for. I had better popcorn at PNC Park.\\n\\nIt would be great if they offered more choices in flavors and sampler gift tins or boxes.",
        "Beautifully decorated! Classy, yet comfortably atmosphere. The food was delicious! and the service was excellent! I had the beet salad and it was very flavorful, then a beef stroganoff dish with perfectly cooked steak.  The bread basket had a couple of different kinds, but it was cold and a little hard, the only thing that wasn't spot on here.",
        "Visited this place after buying a new phone at Sprint.\\n\\nWhen I go into a fro yo I only look for two flavors: Red Velvet & Peanut butter.\\n\\nThey didn't have either, so I left.\\n\\nSorry, I'm bias, but it's my review so I can be :]",

        "I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality.",
        "For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry.",
        "A famous restaurant. Good service, very juicy and tender steak. While, the beer collection is not so good. Almost only canned beers are available (I just saw one beer tap there, which is not on the menu).",
        "Have visited a few times. Always figured the cigar/cigarette smoke smell was coming from the cigar lounge located next door. Until last visit. I witnessed the cook not only smoking cigarettes while stirring the huge pot of soup broth, he actually was sipping from the huge ladle/spoon \\\"taste testing\\\" and putting it back in to continue stirring! \\n\\nI will never and I mean never return! Unbelievable!",
        "I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work.",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",

        "Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.",
        "Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7.75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price.",
        "Great ice cream and for a cause!  Only open during business hours.  For each different flavor a portion goes to a cause i.e. to help with someone's medical bills or to replace a home that burned down.  \\n\\nThey have about 20 different flavors and basic toppings (no sundaes).",
        "Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  \\n\\nI ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.",
        "Picked up a Pizza tonight and it was terrible. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I made sure to be there at that time.  The box seemed warm but not hot.  I didn't really think about it though until after I tasted it.  For almost $18 this should of at least been hot. The crust was chewy not crisp at all.  Not worth it.",
        "Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \\n\\nI tried their weekly special \\\"Breakfast in Bed\\\" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor.

        "This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that.",

They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \\n\\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \\n\\nNegative: very limited selection.",

        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",

        "Astonishing place!  Every time we go we are surprised by new dishes made with fresh seasonal ingredients with a wonderful combination of flavors, textures and wit.  This is our favorite restaurant in the Midwest (beating shallow show spots like Alinea to a pulp) and rivals places like Tilth in Seattle for our top spot overall.",
        "Only thing good is the garlic parm  wings. There's not a lot of meat on them and all the other flavors are disgusting",
        "The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle.",
        "Best wings ever (besides Zipps Golden wings...)! We order a bucket of hot to go and can't wait to get them home! Other things we've tried aren't the greatest, except for the fried calamari. Super good and not chewy like most I've had. Their new patio is really nice and looking forward to the cold nights when they have the fireplace going.",
        "It's Walgreens.  Generally they are all the same.  However, I will say the pharmacy staff here is very good.  They are helpful, friendly, and seem to be efficient in filling prescriptions.  They also are good answering questions about non-prescription products.\\n\\nThere are probably two other Walgreens convenient to either my home or office, and another two or three CVS.  This tends to be my first choice of them all.",
        "The Piemaker boasts that it's sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry. \\nDouble pastry?!?!?!\\nToo perfect.",
        "BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.",
        "I had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road. The ice cream wasn't great; the flavors seemed off, and the texture was grainy. The cone was flavorless and fell apart before I finished the first scoop. For the price, it didn't really seem worth it.",
        "Love there lo mein, Vegas and tempura roll.. so much flavor and really cheap compare to other places. Also, the most I recommend is to try there chicken wings OMG it's so good u won't regret it... if u love chines food and sushi this is the place u must try!! It's worth every penny...",
        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "One of the best local places, they serve big and juicy pieces! And not to mention their fries! They might be a bit thin but they're really good and taste fresh.",
        "Service needs some improvement.Sushi was terrible ! Lacked freshness and most of all flavor...they tasted the same or it was blasted with spice so you could not savor ask the different flavors. I eat sushi regularly....know good and promise me..save you're monies and go elsewhere. if you're an experienced sushi eater you will be disappointed",
        "I had to try this place since they offered Asian flavors. I wanted to try the Black Sesame but it was all out. :( I had the durian instead and it was good but I wish it was more frozen. My ice cream melted so quickly I stopped eating it after a few bites. However, I still would come back to try the other flavors.",
        "Well, in more recent visits here the flavor selection is really limited, and not good. They usually have 1 SF flavor now and it's not good. The regular yogurt itself is just so-so. Not nearly as creamy and delicious as it used to be. When stores change hands you can usually tell a difference. Sorry!",
        "DELISH! My husband and I love going here for our date nights. We both love Mexican food and there premium margaritas (which come in a fishbowl size glass) are great! I always get the Enchiladas Verdes, yum the food is fresh, the salsa's are fresh great authentic flavors.",
        "Horrible burger. Pale color, no flavor, pretty bun but very greasy. Fries were delicious, fresh and hot. Service was ok. For a place called burger anything you'd expect good burgers. This isn't it.",
        "We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently.",
        "Banh mi dog looked great, but taste was lacking. The dog itself was rubbery and bland while the topping of lightly pickled veggies was pretty good.",
        "They do really awesome nail art here but I'm extremely disappointed that every time I get my nails done here, they chip, peel off, break etc. within days.  I got my nails done last Tuesday and they were chipped by Friday (and I wasn't doing anything special with my hands that would cause that).  I've gone here about 4 times and have had that problem every time.  Def won't be going back, it's not worth the money.",
        "The roasted half chicken = GREAT! The mashed potatoes & green beans were very good, as well. The stuffing was good, but could have been better in flavor. The service was great. The bread options & Caesar salad was delish, as well. No complaints, really. The environment of the restaurant was nice - I love the level of privacy in the booths. The bar environment was very moody, dark, and retro - divine!",
        "Really disapointed; burger cost way to much for an unseasoned patty. Not even on the level of say Red Robbin. Wife has a Reuben sandwich that she said was 1/2 decent. Even the 16 oz beer I got tasted like the Draft lines hadn't been cleaned in years.  I could swing in for a drink and music but won't eat here again.",
        "Stopped here on 7/31/2014. The owner waited on my husband and I. The service was great and the ice cream was even better. I will be returning very soon to try the banana cream pie flavor. Great hours too.",
        "I love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale so I was excited when I found one in Chandler.  However, I was more than disappointed. This place has no business calling itself Grimaldi's and should be ashamed! I love love love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, but this location does not even compare. If you are going to pay this much for pizza it better damn well be good!! Makes me very sad and I will NEVER go to this location again. No flavor.",
        "Fantastic tacos. I tried the carne asada and the carnitas. Great flavor and juicy. The salsa doesn't have a lot of flavor, and reminded me of tomato juice.",
        "Ok. Here's the scoop. Loco moco was good, very good. RV pancakes without the chocolate, very tasty. I took to go orders of the banana pancakes. To try at the Volley ball tournament. The line can be outrageous for parties greater than 2. So waiting will be long.(expect up to 45 minutes)",
        "Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \\\"etiqueccy\\\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",
        "Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.\\n\\nThe crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless.",
        "This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good.",
        "Breakfast was fantastic today!  We had the French toast and biscuits and gravy along with home fries and sausage. The sausage was filled with flavor. It's been years since we have been here and the new owners have done a great job of keeping the same casual atmosphere while adding a better menu. Great job!",
        "Very helpful staff, food prepared after ordering, very flavorful. Would highly recommend!",
        "Gross. \\n\\nLo Mein was incredibly salty, without much other flavor. \\n\\nEgg rolls were soggy and disgusting. Forgot to include sweet and sour sauce in the to go order. \\n\\nVegetable fried rice had peas, just. It should be called \\\"peas fried rice\\\". \\n\\nOh, and it's more expensive than average.",
        "Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce was amazing. For $7 you get about 6 ravioli covered in their amazing sauce and a warm, soft breadstick. VERY filling and perfect portion size. I have a thing for alfredo sauce and this is by far one of the best I've had, not watery and has a ton of flavor! Their pizza is way too pricey for me but I'm def going back for more pasta soon!",
        "They have damn good sandwiches. I really love their Earl Grey Lemonade. It is very good with a nice mild flavor. The last time I was there they had stopped making my favorite sandwich which was the turkey, dressing and cranberry. I consider this a good thing because the sandwich was so good I would drive the 30 miles from my house and fight the Strip just to get one.",
        "Went for lunch, the food was okay, chicken kabbob were salty and broiled. The pita had 4 medium pieces of chicken and lots of  lettuce, and pickle with the yogurt sauce. I had hoped for better flavor and more meat (protein). Back to Sabas or Persian Room for lunch.",
        "The sauce and cheese have less flavor than the box.  The crust was puffy and lacked a good chewy texture.  It was pillowy, which is bad crust in my book.  At least it's priced fairly, the staff is pleasant and it has a good location for the neighborhood.  They also sell pieces by the slice.  Nevertheless, I won't be going back.",
        "I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is great - every person really friendly and helpful. My favorite dishes  are the chop chop salad and pork fried rice. The bartenders will make you a special cocktail if you give them a basic flavor profile, which is a great way to try a new drink or two.",
        "They took off my original review because I told the truth they did a horrible job and took forever and still didn't get the order right. Sad Mexican food.",
        "Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.",
        "I'm a KSBS BBQ judge, so I'm a BBQ snob.  I really liked the flavor profiles of the food, it was all over cooked.  Mac-n - cheese was bomb.  I think they do better than what I had so I'll go back and try again.",
        "I love that you can make your own samples here. It makes the experience so much easier and makes for a quicker decision!\\n\\nThey also have a great assortment of flavors and toppings. You can either go healthy and fruity, or decadent!\\n\\nAnd really cute spoons!",
        "I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless.",
        "My wife and I had a carryout order of orange beef and general's chicken with white rice. All were good and fresh. The chicken was thick and juicy, not thin and tough slathered with sauce to cover the poor quality of the meat. The sauces were very good. Polite service over the phone and in person.",
        "Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average.",
        "About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",
        "Got the Korean Burger.  Eh.  It was super sweet.  Overpowering sweet.  The meat was cooked really well but the flavors just didn't work.  Truffle mac and cheese was just not good.  Texture, flavor, cheesiness, just off.  The Grasshopper shake was very good but didn't get me to any level of drunkiness and the onion rings were pretty good.  There are better hamburger places out there.",
        "Pretty good.  Typical sports bar food. Calimari was ok, chili was pretty good, fries were awesome, and the burger wasn't bad.\\nMy friend had the bases loaded big unit (as seen on man vs food). It is an insanely huge hotdog with all the toppings. Could feed 3-4 people.\\nExpect to pay $15 or so per person.",
        "I've eaten a ton of Thai food...no, like a TON of a Thai food, there is a place to get Thai on every corner in Chicago. I have to say, the flavor was very bland. Nothing that made it memorable. The service was great but again, the dishes were just bland.",
        "I will not be back to this restaurant. I placed an order for pickup last Thursday for myself and a co-worker. I had the small jerk meal and my co-worker had a side of collard greens. The chicken was hard, dry and cold. It wasn't fresh.  It was pulled from the fridge and put in the microwave. The beans were hard and rice chewy. The collard greens were bland. Very disappointing. I will not be back.",
        "I was under-impressed.  Stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something.",
        "Sage chicken and waffles and Andy's chicken benedict are always the best!! Got the watermelon kiwi lemonade this time--it was a little sweeter than I typically like, but the flavor was terrific!",
        "I've been going to Phuket for several years. The food is on par if not better than other Thai restaurants I've been to in the city. The curry dishes are very flavourable.  The menu has also been expanding adding in other Asian dishes. Throw in excellent friendly service and you have a nice eating experience in the East End.",
        "I had an awful experience - will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment/voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe - the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe.",
        "Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.",
        "The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty."

        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "I've seen this restaurant change its face several times. This time I hope it stays this way. Both times we ordered carry-out, the servers were wonderful. Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. \\n\\nThe 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.\\n\\n I highly recommend this place.",
        "This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.",
        "Thanks to Rollie & crew, I can now cross this item off my bucket list! Had a great time touring the Arizona countryside and experiencing the ride. They even got me involved with the setup of the balloon which also added another level of interest to the whole experience. Would very much recommend this company to anyone in the Phoenix/Glendale area!!",
        "I went there three times in my one week stay to Vegas this February. The food was great, the service was wonderful (great conversation) and the atmosphere was fun and inviting. My favorite was The Avalon. Mmmm... more goat cheese please. ((Don't miss the Berry Lemonade))\\n\\nKeep it up! When I come back through, expect me again. ((If you're in any doubt, check it out))",
        "Biscuit and Gravy not very good.",
        "It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking.",
        "Been back several times and I will say they have some pretty legit shakes. They are huge! I like the chocolate chip one. The banana split is yummy, too. \\n\\nI had the food once and was not impressed. Will not be doing that again. This rating is solely for their desserts as that's what I go back for now.",
        "These people love what they do and it shows.  One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out. And the customer service! These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit. \\r\\n\\r\\nI love Artamos Deli.",
        "I stopped by to check this place out, maybe get some juice, ended up leaving with the provari kit (too good of a deal to pass up) and a bottle of juice custom made by the sales person helping me. \\nIf you haven't been here yet you are missing out. Great selection, great prices, and great customer service!",
        "Super clean. Great service. 1hookah/2people $20 for hookah & $30 for all night refills. The food looks good but I can't say because I didn't have anything lol but appearance looks good. Came here with my friends which was a group of 6 and we all agreed that it's worth it.",
        "This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.",
        "It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\\n\\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.",
        "Absolutely wonderful!  The food is amazing, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting. Would definitely recommend!",
        "I had the Carnitas Burrito and it had no taste. I definitely know good tasting Carnitas and must echo the sentiments of that famous line in the 1988 VP Debate when I say \\\"You sir are not a good Carnitas Burrito\\\".",

This store is spectacular when it comes to customer service & they seem to have just about everything! It also makes it a pleasure to shop there since they really do have a little black cat roaming around who is extremely friendly. Definitely THE place to go if you need any make up, costumes, gag gifts, & accessories. The owners are a pleasure as well!",
        "Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)",
        "It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease.

        "Expensive, small portions, mediocre food. Go somewhere else!",
        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.",

We will be back here for sure next time... don't worry ramona, we will be sending you a postcard soon!",
        "Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.",

We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!",

We will eat here again for sure.",

        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",

It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",
        "This place is horrible!!! Can't believe how they are still open!! We went for RW, and what a waste of money and time!!! The only up side was the service, our waiter was very attentive ... But the food was terrible!!",
        "Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.",
        "I have had three mediocre pizzas from Marco's.  The pizza has way too much sauce on it and they over cook the cheese. The wait for a dine in order takes way too long. On two occasions I waited over 30 minutes for a pizza and it wasn't during a busy time. I would recommend Dominos or Papa Johns over Marco's Pizza.",
        "Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, tiny portions.  No iced tea, which was a shock. The service was so-so. Very loud inside, and hard to have a conversation. We won't be back. Too bad, because I was excited to have a thai restaurant move into the neighborhood.",
        "We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.\\nWe will go back often!",
        "Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.",

They will fit you for a pair of shoes properly and have a good selection of other running gear at reasonable prices.\\n\\nThey have both Saucony and Brooks lines in one place.  A real win for runners.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place.  Prices  for shoes were a little lower than I have seen elsewhere as well. Not much but 5-10/pair lower.",
        "Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...",
        "The food was bland and portion small and cost high.",
        "The effin service sucks!! All 3 servers were rude, never smiled and when I would ask for something they would just walk away.. I would never come back to this place.. Crab is so salty n what I said b4 SERVICE SUCKS!!!!",
        "Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.",
        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",
        "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",

        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "It was hot outside, but cool inside. We went for an AYCE lunch and enjoyed every bite. The service was fast and friendly. This is no non-sense eating establishment. Most of the clientele with the exception of yours truly were locals. The experience was good, presentation of the food was nice and everything was fresh. We will be back. I have the feeling that if you go for dinner you better plan on waiting cause this place is a local favorite.",

        "I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either.",
        "So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics! However, I believe that every cirque show is my favorite because they have something different to offer!!! \\n\\nI loved the show! The performers are amazing!! & it is a smaller theater so there are no bad seats!",
        "This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a \\\"tax-included\\\" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.",
        "We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.",

        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",
        "Try it if you like e-Coli poisoning and a evening spent on or near the toilet. The Pozole has the taste and texture of a barbecued sock, and comes with a side of salmonella. In the interest of fairness the guacamole was good and the service was decent.",
        "Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.",
        "Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up.",
        "Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street.",
        "Definitely my favorite! It is so easy to come and go, there is never a real mess either. I like that their remodel is so handy for check outs, renewals, and returns.\\n\\nAwesome cd and dvd selections and if it is not available you can always look it up for request :)",
        "Grainy and soft\\nShould serve with a straw",

I rate him 5 stars.",
        "This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back."

Would very much recommend this company to anyone in the Phoenix/Glendale area!!",
        "It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking.",
        "I stopped by to check this place out, maybe get some juice, ended up leaving with the provari kit (too good of a deal to pass up) and a bottle of juice custom made by the sales person helping me. \\nIf you haven't been here yet you are missing out. Great selection, great prices, and great customer service!",
        "It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\\n\\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.",

        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.",
        "Food was mostly good.  Sides definitely not worth the price especially the spinach which was about a handful worth.  They kept part of it raw to take up space in the bowl a size that they would put a side of dressing.  Bone in ribeye was awesome.  Beef Wellington very good.  The salad with green goddess dressing was good and deceivingly filling.  Service was very good.  It just seems slightly overpriced",
        "The food is tasty, but pricey, huge portions. Service was just okay, even though there were no other customers, and despite the fact that I did state it was my first visit, the girl helping seemed annoyed that I had to think for a millisecond about what I wanted.",

Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",

The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh.

I appreciate that at home so they last longer, but when wanting to eat one now it kinda sucks.  Matt the cashier was very friendly and cool as was the bag boy.  Nice place...he said it's family owned and operated.  Like it better than Sprouts which they have in SoCal.",

        "Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.",

        "Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good.",
        "There are some tables and a lot of slot machines. If you live in the area, it could be a good place to go and hang out. I would never recommend a drive from the strip to gamble here, but not bad for a locals hang out. With dollar beer and hot dogs, how can you go wrong!?",

The staff is extremely friendly, the food tastes authentic, and the prices are extremely good for what you get.  4.50 for a burrito with chips/salsa included...can't get much better than that.  I'd recommend trying the quesadilla's there. They make their own tortillas and it really is a one of a kind meal.",

The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",
        "Stopped by the outdoor bar so the wife could get a foo-foo drink while we were walking down the street. While I don't necessarily mind paying $10 for a drink in a small plastic cup, it better have some booze in it at that price; this one, according to my wife, did not pass mustard in that department.",

        "Went here about a year and a half ago with my parents on one of our final nights in Phoenix and we weren't disappointed.  My sister went there a few nights beforehand and recommended it to us after she went there with some friends who live in the area.  I don't know what the new location is like, but would definitely go again if in the area.",
        "Sorry but I have a different opinion. They give you mostly hard meat. Not real meat and it's not worth the price",
        "This is my favorite place to get boba. I usually order a taro milk tea or an avocado smoothing. I love how their reward system works by reserving 10% of your bill each time you come in. I just think they need to keep their dining area a little cleaner.",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "My 1st time here. \\n\\nWe popped in for lunch and some sun on the patio. I can see why the place is so popular, they have a really chill relaxed vibe here - that is IF you can get a parking space. The food was decent for pub grub, but nothing too remarkable. I imagine it's best in the evening with drinks and some pals.\\n\\nI'll be back for happy hour soon.",
        "Awesome place. Sometimes hard to get seats so patience is a must or just flat out luck but totally worth it! Parking is easy and free.  Totally recommended and cant wait for a bigger location to open up! Prices are fair and sizes are perfect.",
        "Super greasy, really cheap prices but somehow they still retained some quality in the food. The pizzas here are pretty good. I wouldn't ever crave them, but I wouldn't be opposed to going here if someone suggested it.\\n\\nThe brownies are really good!",

        "Truly awful service and food!  Think of half the quality of Denny's food for three times the price!  I would never go back.  Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!  Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House.\\n\\nWayne Gorsek",
        "Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.",

        "This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays.",
        "Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!",
        "Food is decent but not the best in Charlotte. Went with friends on Saturday night and it was so noisy I could barely hear my friends talking to me ACROSS THE TABLE. The bar area was worse than the dining room. Lots of families go with their children.I suggest going during the week.  There are better Italian places in our fair city with a lot less noise and confusion. That being said the foodis OK.",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "I was disappointed.  The meat was very bland and I like my meat med well.  They always had med to med rare.  Fish was pretty good without the sauce.  To me the best thing was the mash potatoes and Caesar salad.  Atmosphere was nice service was good but we will never go back again.  Definitely not worth 100 price tag.",
        "We live walking distance and frequent the store. We have purchased all sorts of groceries and steaks and have always been delighted by the superior quality of food. As far as their coffee can't go wrong, when it's $.75 for a refill.  Definitely love this place!",
        "I had been having a hard time finding a place that does good pedi's and I found it.  The quality of the products are superb and the service amazing.  Tiffany really did a great job.  I would recommend to any one.\\n\\nAnother thing I liked was a price list up front.",
        "I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",
        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",
        "I am so happy that people love Picazzo's  This restaurant has been a part of my life for the past 6 years.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the service, food and atmosphere!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a wonderful patio to meet your friends on for a drink-- look no further than Picazzo's in Tempe!!!!",
        "Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.",
        "Great quality at good prices. I was the only and first one to use a coupon. Elyse was awesome!",
        "The food is good and flavorful but the prices are out of line. A cup of soup here is $4.99 when it should be about $2.00. It consisted of broth, maybe 1 sliced up mushroom and 3 shrimp. Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",
        "Really enjoyed the food and service. Delicious ribs and brisket. Mac & cheese was different, but very tasty. The owners were extremely attentive and friendly. Very reasonable prices...four of us ate for less than $40. Go try it out and support a local business",
        "Nice area, quiet, 3 separate playgrounds, 2 for my toddler that's safe enough with safety swings, and no sand which is always great. Open grass areas too. Covered picnic area so it's a good place to have a play date.",
        "I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food.",
        "Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get.",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "I was not impressed. Bad food and bad service. The price was out of the question for this place. I will never return.  I suggest Pacific Sea Food for the same price.",
        "Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!"

        "Dr. Camp is unprofessional, money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions.",
        "Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.",
        "Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.",
        "Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "Came here a few weeks ago with friends. Breakfast was good, tea was nice, atmosphere ok. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. I love the location and the interior is vintage and original. The outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather. Moderately priced.",
        "Amazing bagels, it is by far the best bagel you can have. I always eat at least one before I even leave the store. \\n\\nIn Montreal, there is always a debate about who the best but for me I give my vote to Fairmount. In addition to the great taste, it remains soft even after I freeze it for a month.",
        "The nacho selection did not impress me I like real cheese on my nachos bummer. \\n\\nI ordered the chips and salsa, chips were bathed in salt and only one salsa was tasty. I went for the burger as my entree which was actually pretty good.",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "Decent 80s style pizza, but I prefer more of a kick to pizza sauce.",
        "Inside the South Point Casino and great spot for a late night snack/ dinner.  Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "The wings here are excellent.  The \\\"suicide\\\" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good.",
        "Valentina altered my wedding dress and it fit perfectly! I received numerous compliments on how well my dress fit me. My husband was breathless when he saw me in it. Valentina is fairly priced and she does an amazing job. She is extremely talented! You must book ahead of time because she books up fast.\\n\\nI highly recommend Valentina's Bridal and Tailors.",
        "This is the best place for burritos in Charlotte.  Particularly recommend the vegetarian burrito.  Great atmosphere, cool staff and music, easily accessible from downtown, Dilworth, and South End.  As good as any burritos I've had in cities known for their burrito- like food, including LA.",

My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "Had a water heater go out. The Rocky Mountain Restoration team got my home looking back to normal in no time. Very grateful for their help.",

        "Love this place!  They always have great beers on tap & the lil pig sandwich is plenty of food for lunch or dinner. We take my Dad here when he comes in from KC and he likes the BBQ.",
        "And by one star mean no stars!  Mediocre ice cream, it's cold and icy, but lacks in creamy deliciousness. The \\\"bottled water\\\" is simply tap water in a reused bottle. Total rip off.",

        "I purchased a deal through Groupon for a full highlight, haircut and deep conditioning treatment. Faith did a great job on my highlights! I am really happy with the way they turned out.\\n\\nThe Beauty Venue is in a great location, great pricing and Faith has flexible hours. I'll definitely be going back for another highlight.",
        "Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue.",
        "Service was average. Had to send steak back as it was crunchy on the outside. Potatoes Au Gratin seemed like something out of a box. Waitress brought another member of our party the incorrect wine. Valet took 45 minutes to get our car. In general, a disappointing experience. Won't be back.",

Sliders are tasty, fries are the way they should be and drink pours can be generous depending on who's bartending.\\n\\nThe patio is a nice little spot but can get a bit smoke filled depending on the night of the week. But they do have plenty of heaters out there so that is definitely a bonus!",
        "Well, in more recent visits here the flavor selection is really limited, and not good. They usually have 1 SF flavor now and it's not good. The regular yogurt itself is just so-so. Not nearly as creamy and delicious as it used to be. When stores change hands you can usually tell a difference. Sorry!",
        "I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \\n\\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.",
        ".....ya know, I should have known better! never settle for less cuz your in a hurry.",
        "Pizzas have shrunk in size dramatically since they have opened, and are pretty tasteless in my opinion. I prefer Little Caesars pizza over this place if that says anything. My pepperoni pizza tasted like a grease pizza with cheese that was not completely melted. The wings aren't too bad, they are the only reason this joint received any stars.",
        "This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competition nearby I am surprised they stay in business here.",

        "Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered.",
        "Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.",

Their pastas are very reasonably priced at only $11.95.  The green salad was very fresh and had a tasty creamy house dressing.  The soups are always delicious in the cooler months.  Don't miss the Witch of the Village!",

        "If I could give 10 stars, I would. A friend and I literally stumbled upon this pizzeria on our attempt to make it to Crescent Ballroom. We sat at the bar, had a bottle of wine (great Italian variety) with amazing apptizers, we almost past on pizza until we noticed the owner watching every pizza cook individually and making sure each one got just enough heat . Finallly people in AZ who know pizza. Thank you. Traditional pizza done right.",

        "decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good.",
        "First get there, hostess wasnt very nice. Took our name then sat next 2 partys to walk in right away? Ok was in a hurry so didn't have time to send my food back but really I ordered an omelet with 2 ingredients, not tough. And you forget the bacon, of all things. But you had no problem charging for it. I wanted to like this place!",
        "Delicious & friendly staff! The baguette used for the sandwich was extremely soft and the potato soup was perfect for today's gloomy weather. Only downside was that the coffee was slightly acidic/sour but that's only a preference. Will def be back for lunch soon",
        "Decent place, came here for the happy hour, wine was OK and the happy hour selection was average.  The wine choice could have been more inspired, as it favored the full bodied sweet reds, only one of the choices was to my liking: a fairly dry Pinot Noir.\\n\\nI had the Kobe beef sliders, meh, my buddy talked them up like they were the best shit on earth, but I would have preferred White Castle.",
        "Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.",
        "Ok so when it's around 2 am and you just won a good amount of money on the nickle slots, what do you do?  You celebrate with some Sbarro pizza, that's what you do.  I got one slice of pepperoni and mushroom and it hit the spot.  Ok when you're in a hurry and need something quick.",
        "My stylist Traci did a great job! I did a cut style and deep conditioning. She knew a lot about hair and the cut was great. She did exactly what I wanted! The smallest trim possible, I'm trying to grow my hair out and she made it look super healthy, she fixed my bangs, and did some damage control from a few of my previous cuts! Thanks I'll be back :)",

        "Not a fan.  Pretty sure I was waiting for a food poisoning experience.  It was clean, I will acknowledge that.  But I am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered.  It seemed gross and chewy.\\n\\nNo flavor after adding 10 ladles of sauces.  It was a miracle we survived, since we only went based on our GPS and not reviews.\\n\\nLesson learned......read Yelp!",
        "Have only had 1 massage here.  It was ok; felt more like a sports massage (with stretching involved) than a relaxing one.  I prefer the atmosphere and massage techniques at Dolce.  I do frequent this place for brow waxing, even though they did burn me once.  Cute place though.",
        "This was a great little place to grab dinner in a hurry. Service was prompt and polite. The food was good, but you cant go too wrong with pho. It was a good portion for the price ($8 for a regular bowl).  I'd love to go back try the other menu items.",
        "The service was very good and the restaurant itself was nice and relaxing. The food on the other hand was hit-or-miss. The Brussel sprouts and french fries were delicious, but the tavern burger and grilled chicken fingers were ordinary. A big killer was the small portion size of the salads. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a place to go to in Champaign if you haven't been to the likes of Seven Saints.",
        "Can you say delicious? Everything, from the salsa choices and the guac, to the street tacos (we had the all pastor) and all the entrees was amazing. And then there was the flan. I'm picky about that. Creamy, rich, smooth, and obviously carefully and freshly made. And churros too! The drinks were pretty fabulous, and worth the price. We'll be back for sure.",
        "Closest off the strip reasonably priced JewFood in the Northwest side of the valley. Matzo ball soup and Pastrami spell comfort food. Like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in. Great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry.",
        "Second time here, food came out very fast on a Saturday afternoon lunch time, pretty dang tasty overall, had a Pa-nang curry, pineapple fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken pad Thai. We ordered everything spicy, yet still wanted more heat! If you like your Thai dishes spicy, order it at an 11 (out of 10). Maybe you'll get lucky and get that heat we missed out on.",
        "great place to stay but the valet needs work......an associate by the name \\\"Craig mertz\\\" was rude and impolite, someone should teach that kid how to work in the hospitality industry",
        "For being a local hang out,  this place has the coldest draft beer around and the nachos and wings  aren't too shabby either...  Unfortunately this place has the MOST unfriendliest waitresses around. The minute you step in you are greeted by  a long face gal that can just sour the rest of your nite.",
        "Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.",
        "Cheap beer, neat setting, lots of seating but fairly quiet on a Saturday night around 11pm...I was pretty hyped in coming to this place but the vibe there was just too quiet and they didn't really have a lot of beer selection, altho they did have their own brewery in the background",
        "Prices are a bit more than $5 so a bit misleading. Food was average except Thai which was the only dishes worth getting. No credit cards and $1 charge for debit.  It is a smoky dive where you need a key to get to the restroom.",
        "Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.",
        "The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!",
        "Dr. Cruz is a very good physician.  She actually touches you and listens to what you are telling her and tries to get you to the right diagnostic testing or specialist.  I have enjoyed having her as my physician and my family's physician.  The office is clean and the staff is usually pretty professional and attentive.  Not sure if she is returning to the practice so I had to find another primary care physician but would prefer to see Dr. Cruz again.",
        "I've never once been able to get a pretzel dog at the McCarran Airport location, unless I wanted (was able) to wait for them to cook up a batch (we're usually in a bit of a hurry when at an airport, no?). \\n\\nNot once have they had pretzel dogs ready to buy when I've been there; hoping others have had better luck.",
        "The price was good for the strip and the location was centrally located. The free valet was a nice relief. The staff was friendly and the room was clean.\\n\\nDefinitely pay the extra money to upgrade and get a view of the strip and volcano from your room if you have the option!",
        "Disappointing...no heat in the room, pet stains on the carpet, sink backed up....and no one answered the phone when I tried to report these issues. On the other hand, as mentioned below, Steve the bartender continues to provide an exemplary level of service that used to be the norm at the Crescent.",
        "This place is great!  I have a flock of chickens and they need food.  Tempe Feed and Tack is close to my house (of course! I live in tempe...) and the people are super helpful and friendly.  They always load up the 50lb bags of feed and I never have to wait.",
        "Came here this past Veterans Day weekend.  The woman needed her Asian food fix.  I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine.  Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish.  Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better.",
        "I often crave for their tonkotsu ramen! The soup is so full of taste and creamy! No other ramen places can top that! The texture of the ramen is great too! Took a few friends there on several occasions and not once I did not hear compliments. Wish the place was bigger though.",
        "Man muss schon ein wenig warten, bis man seinen D\\u00f6ner in der Hand h\\u00e4lt, aber das Warten lohnt sich. Es gibt hier einen halben D\\u00f6ner, der mit viel Liebe zubereitet wird, zu einem unschlagbaren Preis.\\n\\n\\n Essen!",
        "This Subway was hopping the night my friend and I were here. It was before the Carly Rae Jepsen/Hot Chelle Rae concert downtown and a local high school dance, and the employees were bum rushed. We went at the perfect time, just before all the high school kids flocked in. Our service was fast and spot on. The food was excellent and right on the money.",
        "Frozen hot chocolate, grilled cheese sandwiches, goldfishes swimming in my tomato soup, creamy mac and cheese, and one of the best chili I have tried.  Can't you tell I like this place.  My Las Vegas to go to place!",
        "The food here is ok to good but varies a lot. Serving tables are set too hot as are the heat lamps so food that's fresh from the kitchen is better than stuff that's been sitting. Salad table is fine as are the deserts.  And in any case it's considerably better than what I've been eating in Beatty for the last two days.",
        "I had the clam chowder and a dozen oysters. The chowder was very creamy and thick.. it almost had the texture of a potato soup. The bar seats around 25 or so people and there are a few tables. There a good selection of dishes. The oysters were sweet, but on the smallish side.",
        "From a business traveler perspective, I have nothing bad to say about this Avis at the Phoenix Airport.  As others have indicated in their reviews, it is worth becoming Avis Preferred so you can have a car ready and assigned to you when you arrived.  \\n\\nMy party got off the shuttle, walked to the board to see where our car was, found the car and checked out when we left the lot.  Piece of cake and only took a couple minutes.",
        "Benjarong is one of our favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. Not only is the food authentic and delicious (their heat scale is very accurate), but the service is really attentive and always consistent. We especially love the Pad Thai, won ton soup, Thom Yum soup and pineapple fried rice. An excellent place for a lunch date or with coworkers or family.",
        "I had a positively delicious breakfast on a Sunday early afternoon.  I got the breakfast quesadilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, black beans, and not enough cheese. It also comes with a side of homemade salsa that was super pureed and did not have enough heat or chunks of tomato for my liking.  Seriously though, despite these two things it was still quite tasty.\\n\\nThe place was packed but our service was excellent.  The pies/cakes looked amazing, must try!",
        "The smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx. The chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly \\\"Sinaloa.\\\" The chicken comes with rice, beans, a grilled jalape\\u00f1o,  tortillas, and a small side salad. The beans and rice taste home made and the chicken is delicious.",
        "Food are little bit salty but the service is great. If you prefer something more special to try than buffet. Stratta would be a not bad to try. I highly recommended the tata beef appetizer.",

Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer). \\n\\nThey try and keep their atmospheres similar between the one on central and here.\\n\\nThis one feels more condesnsed than the one on central. Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.\\n\\nFood is the same at both places.",
        "One of the best asian restaurants in Pittsburgh!  The portions are generous, the service is fast and friendly, the decor is stylish and classy and the food is fresh and delicious.  The prices are a bit high, but you definitely get premium gourmet food for the premium price.  I haven't had a single thing on the menu that didn't impress me!",
        "After going to the farmers market in Guadeloupe,  this place was awful. They are way over priced on a lot of items, like fresh eggs and honey. The store had so much stuff it was hard to find items and they didn't have much local items. The service was so so. This place is more hype than anything good.",
        "In a convient location for me between work and home.   Store is easy to get around, and find whatever you are looking for.  The store staff seems to be helpful the times I have came in.  I prefer the home depot up the road off of ray just because the staff is more knowledgeable, and have been more helpful to myself.",
        "Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !",
        "Delightful restaurant!  Had the lamb sagg (4.5 heat) and my daughter had the chicken tiki marsala (6 heat). We both enjoyed the selection and appreciated the free appetizer with sauce (7 heat) to know how to gauge the heat index. The garlic naan was outstanding! And our server was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!!",

        "Their dumplings are great. But everything else tastes like something you could find in the freezer section at the grocery store. Not to mention we waited over 30 minutes for our to-go order. I would understand if it was really busy or something but we were the only ones there."

        "Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "I had dinner here with a large group of people so i was able to try many items. The food was very disappointing. Foie gras app was overcooked and so were my scallops. I ate one bite of my scallop entree and left hungry. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant is great cocktails and service.",
        "The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.",

And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.",
        "This was our first stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. The service was not very good, we sat for about 15 minutes and no one came around so we moved to a table in the middle of the restaurant and finally got some service. The wine was ok, the fruit and cheese plate tasty, but I don't think I would ever make a point to visit here again.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",

        "For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry.",

        "I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \\\"to go\\\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots.",

It's not brain surgery people!!!!",

Tried both the Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches and they were both really good and huge.  \\nI also had the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel plain and it was stale thus the 3 star rating... but if toasted and with cream cheese or for a sandwich then probably would have been better.\\nHowever, I do prefer the Carneige Deli in Mirage.",
        "Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday.",
        "I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!",
        "I honestly had a completely different experience here than the past visitors. \\n\\nI found the Diagnostic center when I was searching for a new Primary Care Dr. that accepted Culinary Insurance. I was very pleased to find Dr. Hess is currently accepting new patients. \\n\\nI found the staff incredibly friendly and educated. They were all dressed very casually which was nice because it made you forget you are at the Doctor. \\n\\nI am thrilled to have found a new doctor!",

And that was from the kiddy mgr who had to take over because the rest had never seen a check before. After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back.",
        "This place is the spot for lunch! I mean come on. Its Indian food buffet style! What's not to like about that. They serve you garlic naan or plain naan also buffet (all you can eat). The have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice. I always eat about a metric ton of food and when I get the bill... That's right $10. Starbucks costs more than that!! Definitely try this place out.",
        "we had our valentines dinner here at Indian paradise, were so excited that there's Indian restaurant here in Scottsdale since we just recently moved from San Francisco. I only gave 2 stars because the food are way to expensive for what you get and thee food isn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at dinner time.",
        "Yelp sent me here! I came right before lunch ended on a Monday, after the lunch rush. I ordered the blue fin special, white tuna nigiri, rainbow trout nigiri, ahi poke salad, red dragon and mussels. I would skip the mussels, but everything  else was good and tasted fresh. You have to get the white tuna. Its ridiculously melt in your mouth goodness! For $22 lunch AYCE, how could you go wrong?",

She did the crystals on them and everything I was so thrilled and felt totally VIP when she took care of me immediately. I have never felt so un-rushed or pushed into anything in my life! Ask for Tiffany She is AMAZING!!",
        "The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory",

        "I live within 10 minutes walking time of this place and finally made it in there today with some friends after a brown bag @gangplank.\\n\\nI got the veggie pies as they were the only thing vegetarian,but they were delicious. its easy to miss this place but worth finding and trying.",
        "This morning was my 1st time here. Might be my last. Service was adequate. Kind of slow but she was very friendly. Coffee was good but my main complaint was that my French toast was only Luke warm and not the tastiest. Maybe I'll give it another chance. Although I'd rather go to places I know I love like Layers and Sunrise cafe.",
        "Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!",

        "Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors.",
        "Bertha's Cafe Just opened up at it's new location, 32nd street and Indian School Rd.!!!!!  I have been going through withdrawl!!! So happy they are open.",
        "We ate here based on rave reviews. Although the portions were indeed huge, the flavors were  underwhelming. My husband had the portobello mushroom sandwich which was pretty flavorless. I had the salmon salad. The salmon was cooked nicely but the horseradish cream dressing tasted like sour cream. The service was slow and nearly every staff member including the manager walked by the dirty table across from us for nearly 30 minutes before it was finally cleaned. Disappointing.",
        "I finally made it to the breakfast club! The food was delicious and the place was gorgeous.",
        "I have been a few times and each time I am so happy I went. The food is unreal! I have tried the filet mignon, the salmon, the chicken scallopini all which melted in your mouth! They have everything from espresso drinks to top notch wine. I love the fact that is a Vegas family run establishment as well. Everyone is really so nice and cares about making you happy. Gotta love that it is a 24hr place to!",
        "Ewwww! I drive by this place everyday. Thought I would give it a shot today. I took 2 bites and had to throw the rest away. I will never come here again. The owners should be embarrassed to serve this slop. I wish I could get my $7 back.",

        "Harlow's, you are overrated.  Your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  Your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. The toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.\\n\\nI do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a Tempe tradition, go to Chompies or Essence.",
        "I came here for lunch on Sunday and for some reason they did not have any crab legs.  How can you not serve crab legs??\\n\\nEvery time I go to a buffet, I must eat the prime rib.  And their prime rib was OK.  A few things that stood out were the lobster ravioli, shrimp and peso pizza, and the french toast station.  They have a big dessert section.  But no cones for ice cream!",
        "Well, in more recent visits here the flavor selection is really limited, and not good. They usually have 1 SF flavor now and it's not good. The regular yogurt itself is just so-so. Not nearly as creamy and delicious as it used to be. When stores change hands you can usually tell a difference. Sorry!",
        "I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \\n\\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.",
        "Yum!  Best fried catfish I have ever had.  The staff is super friendly the food is great.  The desert menu changes daily but if you have the chance to try the bread pudding, go for it!  The shrimp etouffe is a great buttery, garlic wonderland in your mouth.",
        "Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad.  Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable.  Bring your own wine or beer - but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street.  Unfortunately, at 7:00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table-wide conversation.",
        "I just had dinner at Diya with my boyfriend. The food was good but it was pricey. It has small portions and is definitely fine dining. If you are looking for an inexpensive night of Indian food with large portions, this is not the place.",

        "No star would be better, horrible customer service in the \\\"SERVICE\\\" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!",
        "I used to love this place. I have been going there for over 10 years. Lately, the food is not as good. The Pho has little meat compared to others, and they charge extra for meatballs, when they have them. They never have mint, and on more than one occasion I have seen a roach on the wall. I hate to say it, but I stopped going when they started cutting back.I",
        "Love this place!! Amazing home decor! I finally found the shelf that I needed for my kitchen and they have tons of cute decorations to make your house a home, very unique!",
        "A New Orleans haven in Phoenix! This restaurant/cafe has the perfect combination of French/New Orleanian food & beverage options. The French press here is some of my favorite coffee in town. Plus a great wine selection & authentic French food offerings. I'd read about this place and finally got to try it- what a treat! Well worth the drive, and I'll definitely be returning.",
        "Breakfast was fantastic today!  We had the French toast and biscuits and gravy along with home fries and sausage. The sausage was filled with flavor. It's been years since we have been here and the new owners have done a great job of keeping the same casual atmosphere while adding a better menu. Great job!",
        "We ate here for St. Patrick's Day and the food was amazing!  The weight staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had never been before but glad we did and will go again.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was great!",
        "Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal.",
        "There is nothing Grand Canyon-esque about the Grand Canyon Experience except the fake rock facade and the real birds that have taken up residence inside (I saw three).  This is a large tourist trap, I mean souvenir shop.  They have every kind of trinket including crystals, \\\"Indian\\\" jewelry, and myriad Las Vegas T-shirts.  There are two floors packed with stuff you don't need.",
        "Great place in Noda. I recently went to a friend's get together and we eventually ended up here. Large outdoor space with lots of tables. The bartender served the liquor generously and the environment was casual yet young and fun without making me feel like I was the oldest one there, which I probably was. Great place for summer drinks with good company.",
        "Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!",
        "Meh, I don't get the big deal over this place. Ordered the Mel's \\\"special\\\" breakfast (toast, eggs, taters, and a side dish) with a milkshake and it came to $10. It may sound okay to some but that was one of the most mediocre dishes I've ever had; certainly not worth $10. Buy yourself some eggs and fancy bread and you'll be much more satisfied.",
        "AMAZING PEOPLE! They provide great services in grooming and boarding, and today they just warmed my heart. They donated their time to help an abandoned dog, on a holiday no less. If your looking for exceptional care and people to groom or board your loved furry friends, Planet Petopia is it!!!!!",
        "Tired and outdated equipment.  It's embarrassing to jog on a treadmill to have it squeak and rattle so loud everyone looks at you.  While I was never the slimmest person there, I wasn't the heaviest either.  After 5 years, I finally left because membership was being offered to new members for considerably less than I was paying.",

And... best of all.... the BREAD PUDDING. So nom. My parents really like the creme brulee too. Great spot with great food!",
        "A decent and clean Indian store that's close by.  For the most part they have a good selection of Indian staples.  Their fresh produce can be iffy.  You have to go on the right days to get to the fresh veggies, which is on Thursday.  Their products are moderately priced, and the staff is friendly and always helpful.",
        "Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.",
        "This review is for Sunday NFL Breakfast - good food as in the 'all you can eat' breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. Good bar food. Also good was the French toast - 6 large triangles with good (maple) syrup. Service is SLOW here in the morning though with only one cook. But hey... it's Sunday NFL and the beer is cold and cheap and the wait staff is smiling all morning long while you watch your favorite teams play ball.",
        "This place is understaffed, or else staff is poorly scheduled to take care of customers.  Recently took our car here for the first time, with a coupon.  Front staff tried to upsell me for detailing, windshield repair, etc., which I hate; the car went thru the wash quickly  but then sat in line for 35 minutes before anyone touched it. 25 minutes later, it was finally finished.  Car looked fine, but service delayed too long for me. Bring a book.",
        "Went to red robin on April 26, 2014 at 5:20 pm. We were ignored for 20 minutes before finally being offered something to drink. Food was great. We had the grilled chicken sandwich,  pizza, and a burger.  Took 20 minutes to get more fries. Waitress constantly ignored our table. Great food. Poor service.  Wouldn't recommend this place during peak times if you want decent service. I may go back on a tuesday or another less busy time.",
        "Love this place! Was referred by a friend. I am very particular about my nails and have finally found a place where I leave 100% happy. Very clean and fun atmosphere with tons of colors to chose from. The nail techs are all very talented and friendly.",
        "I normally love this place, but the staff has changed. The hostess was so rude. Kept people waiting for days, even with empty tables. When I finally got seated, she put me right next to a table full of kids. When I asked for a different table, she rolled her eyes, and was a total smart ass. NO people skills whatsoever. The service has become progressively worse. Looks like I'll need to find a new breakfast spot.",
        "Had dinner on 05/02/08; we had no reservations and just walked in, which made it a plus. The service was great, the decor and atmosphere made it fun, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and the star rabbit sake were awesome..definately recommend these two!",
        "Our limo driver suggested this place so we had to give it a try...\\n\\nI know it was probably an accident, but I found a strand of long hair in my sausage and another in my drink. Unlucky coincidence or they just hated me?\\n\\nI got sick and threw up a few hours later.\\n\\nMy French toast, bacon, and eggs tasted good but ended up clogging the sink.",
        "Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy.",
        "The challah French toast with fried chicken is amazing...until you come back. I've been there three times already, always asking for the same plate because I loved it. Then I have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next.",
        "Not a whole lot of ambiance going on which I was used to at Box.  A very medical office type environment but the staff is really friendly.  Love the Australian wax for its gentleness on my skin but wasn't thrilled with the results.  Wasn't as thorough as other waxes.",
        "I have been here 3 or 4 times and have always received great service...the only reason why I come is for the zuppa  tuscana soup and breadsticks so I can not comment on the rest of the food. They seem to have a lot of new items on the menu, including some yummy looking desserts.",
        "The service is very very slow. The server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17, WTF. The food was cold, no other server or manager came to help her out. I finally had to complain after 1 1/2 hours to the manager. I will never go here again.",
        "Had to drop my rating a couple of stars because they never offer the trout for the 3 course lunch special anymore.  The trout is what really made the lunch special great.",
        "Not too shabby for seafood in Vegas. Very affordable, fast service, great variety.  Good spot to get your quick seafood fix. I ordered snow crab and shrimp.  Pretty fresh and not \\\"fishy\\\" at all. However the crab legs were kind of small compared to normal snow crabs.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot.",
        "My wife just returned from here. First, they didn't want to do her nails because she didn't have an appointment (even though the place was more than half empty and 3 or 4 employees were surfing the web or texting on their cell phones). Ridiculous! They finally agreed and then did a CRAP job! Cut her cuticles until they bled. NEVER AGAIN! BEWARE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",
        "Not impressed. This was my first and last visit here. From the moment I walked in was not good. Two separate entrance people unsure of where to form the lines or where to order. Ordered a lightly toasted chicken salad sandwich and got it home and found it burned (so much I couldn't eat it) with barely a bite of chicken in it.  Paid way to much.",
        "Burger is very sloppily thrown together. However it was very tasty!    Fries need to be crispier.  Cajun fries are the way to go!!    Service is very good!",
        "After reading the reviews and hearing some word of mouth I finally had a chance to check out Forefathers.  It's umm, not rad.  It's not terrible either, but I would definitely drive several miles past it for Uncle Sam's or Corleone's.  For my money it's about a half a star above The Steak Escape or some similar abomination.",
        "Good bagels, but wish they would toast them better. Not sure if that's they're technique but a soggy bagel is never great in my book. Was ecstatic when we learnt we had a bagel spot in our neighborhood, but these bagels pale in comparison to spots in other big cities. Staff were very nice and the place had great service. Just wish the bagels were a little better.",
        "Came here for lunch with some coworkers.  The place was pretty packed - we waited about 20 minutes for our food to finally come out.  The food was pretty decent.  I had the chicken fajita and it was very tasty and made me very full.  I'll try the nachos next time as my coworker had it and it looked fantastic!",
        "Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here.

        "This place is hit or miss. I love the food, the menu has a great selection, however I have had some bad experiences here. I took my mom here one afternoon and the service was horrible, we sat at our table and waited forever before we even got water and when we finally got our food it was cold. I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again",
        "Second time here, food came out very fast on a Saturday afternoon lunch time, pretty dang tasty overall, had a Pa-nang curry, pineapple fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken pad Thai. We ordered everything spicy, yet still wanted more heat! If you like your Thai dishes spicy, order it at an 11 (out of 10). Maybe you'll get lucky and get that heat we missed out on.",
        "Went here with family. \\nVery busy restaurant, the food was decent, nothing special.\\nCustomer service was ok, some were rude.\\nPineapple buns are bomb!\\nThe parking sucked.",
        "Very disappointing. Went there for a late breakfast (11 am), paid 100$ for 3 people. Rushed, unfriendly service. Tasteless toasts straight from the supermarket. Butter had a weird, cheesy taste. Omelet was just ok. The Verandah gets one star for its nice outside terrace and one star for the mini Belgian waffles, the only dish we had that was above average."

They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.",

The starff was super-friendly, and our server, Trisha, was just delightful and had great personality.  The only area lacking was the salad dressing ... I tried both their Caesar and 1000 dressing, and neither of them were tasty.  So, another order of Q-rolls!",

I'm not kidding...then I vowed to write a review the next day.\\n\\nGo on sundays and get the half chicken special, comes with a HUGE drink and bread. Get the lemonade drink. Sometimes, I wish I could just buy their sauce (which I think you actually can) and just pour it on everything I eat. Their sauce is what makes their food delicious.",

Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",

        "A tip of the hat to their creativity,  effort to source locally, passion for quality, and engaging customer service.  Also, all the other superlatives that were repeated ad nasuem in the other reviews.  \\n\\nI also like that this place is literally just down the street from the Cold Stone Creamery headquarters.  I wonder how often they have their corporate spies in there.",

        "Tried their new store at 3140 S. Gilbert Road...very hard to find (no frontage, no signage, no street visibility) but well worth it!  Excellent carne asada.

The toppings are like extra toppings and the crust is crisp n chewy, I've read some ppl ask fir extra sauce but I thought it was good enough, unless u like saucy pizzas.

It's never fun finding out AFTER you order and pay for something that it's unavailable. I wish their stock was as consistent as their service, but I'm not going in there for the service.",
        "Ok. The two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it. WTF? Don't they clean the floors? But the bartenders did make me forget about the nastiness with the strong and cheap drinks. That was the only reason it didn't get one star. I'd go back if I'm in Champaign again.",

The service is even worst. No one in this hotel has any idea what customer service and guest relation is about...so don't bother complaining.",

Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",

On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",
        "Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \\n\\nTo put it simply, this place has:\\nA decent happy hour\\nOkay service\\nMediocre sushi\\n\\nJust go somewhere else.",
        "The peanut butter & jelly cake was served hot. So the peanut butter was runny and the cake was really dry & hard. You couldn't taste the jelly until you got into the center of the cake. Warm grape jelly isn't too great to eat. The latte tastes like any other latte.",
        "I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.",
        "Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks.",
        "The sushi was so so, service was mediocre and the drink \\\"hello kitty martini\\\" is the furthest thing from a martini. Ultimately dissatisfied.",
        "I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "I was there this week twice..awesome food...taste great...and a cool staff ....great job with this new location...dish that you should try stuffed quinoa avocado. .Yummy",
        "The service here is horrible. We couldn't get the attention of our waiter. The calm chowder was extremely salty, they took it back to replace it, but it seems like the just added water to the bowl......regardless, it was still salty! The food wasn't that good either. It seems like the chief had a bad day, so he/she wants to make ours bad too.",
        "Not impressed by the food. \\nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \\nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \\nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!",
        "The staff is always friendly!  The green tea was great the last time I got it.  This Saturday I got an orange pineapple spritzer and it was absolutely fantastic.",
        "This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\\nIt puts the whole community to shame.",
        "Excellent selection of pastries, including chocolate almond croissants.  \\n\\nBoth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio creme/paste (delicious!)\\n\\nThere is a Lafleur nearby, in case anyone wants poutine before or after...",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!",
        "Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\\n\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nGood portions.\\n\\nAffordable.",
        "Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.\\n\\nCibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts.",
        "I was disappointed.  The meat was very bland and I like my meat med well.  They always had med to med rare.  Fish was pretty good without the sauce.  To me the best thing was the mash potatoes and Caesar salad.  Atmosphere was nice service was good but we will never go back again.  Definitely not worth 100 price tag.",
        "Always great service!  The staff is always friendly and quick to take and deliver my order.  I love tea and they have a great selection and have even offer to deliver to me when having a busy day.  They always suggest yummy options for different breakfast or snack ideas.   I'm not a coffee fan but the girls in my office say that it is good.  I definetly recommend this local coffee shop for great tea and food!",
        "Ate breakfast with friends.  The french toast was overwhelming!  More than any one person should eat!  The bacon is the best in town.  Compares favorably with ihop across the street and would pick indy over a chain anytime.\\n\\nWill go again if just to try the bacon doughnuts!",
        "Yum, yum, yum....need i say more?   Expected fast somewhat mediocre greek food....got the most delicious lunch!   Be sure to get the grilled chicken salad!",
        "Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food. \\nI could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience. \\nBasically good for booze, but not much else.",
        "went for restaruant week.\\nabsolutely fantastic.\\nthe filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.\\nthe creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. \\nthe staff are very professional and friendly. \\natmosphere compliements the entire experience.\\ni hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!",
        "Yummy!!!!    Very good.   Wow, calzone personal can feed two.   :)",
        "Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty.",
        "Just opened, I will give them them the benefit of the doubt cause there other counterpart on charleston, not as good service could be better, layout is nice, ordered the burger, fries where great burger was burnt on the outside despite ordering med well, either they over used a blow torch or didn't clean the stove.",
        "This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes.",
        "I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better. The service wasn't bad, and the presentation was typical. Just nothing special. I have no specific complaints, but nothing to brag about or remember, either.",
        "One of my favorite places to go and grab a med plate. The med plates here (humus, tabouli, salad & dressing, pita bread) are by far the best in town. It does get busy pretty fast after 7 and parking can sometimes be a pain. When it is full and busy, it gets hard to hear anyone talking and it's almost like being at a club.",
        "I was so disappointed , Bobby Flay should revisit this place , this food did not live up to the hype. Fries too salty, my medium burger\\nWas more medium well . Too pricey for the \\nLack of quality . Go down the block to Gordon Ramsey's .",
        "Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good.",
        "I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \\n\\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \\n\\nNegative: very limited selection.",
        "Terrible service. Mediocre food.",
        "Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.",
        "Their 50% off for locals is a big rip off. They add on 18% gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good, it's mediocre Italian at best for their prices.",
        "I like perusing this place! They have many colorful decor items, including furniture, sculptures, furniture, fabric, bobbing turtles...the list continues. I bought some decorative tiles on here for $1 each. These are unique and cheap gifts, a good place to go if you want to give someone an \\\"Arizona\\\" present.",
        "Prociutto was yummy.\\n\\nVeal meatballs were awesome.\\n\\nGood starters but the reason we came here was for the pizza.  Never again...\\n\\nPizza - took one bite and that was it - yuk - among the worst ever - it was crunchy - like biting into a cracker.  \\n\\nBatali should be ashamed of himself.",
        "And by one star mean no stars!  Mediocre ice cream, it's cold and icy, but lacks in creamy deliciousness. The \\\"bottled water\\\" is simply tap water in a reused bottle. Total rip off.",
        "quite the dive, obviously a local place to gamble, which is a great secret a tourist should not be privvy to. the max bet on a slot i was playing was 60-cents. c'mon, i've played that slot b4 at other casinos and the max bet was $3.00. definitely a favorite place to gamble.",
        "So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening.",
        "(This is the McD's inside the Monte Carlo food court)\\n\\nThis place gave me and 3 of my friends food poisoning!  After losing alot of money at roulette, I wanted to comfort myself with some good ol' fashioned greasy food from my childhood. \\n\\nBAD IDEA.  7 people sharing one bathroom, 4 of them sick.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!",
        "Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.",
        "Mattie's is a great addition to Charlotte.  It is comfortable and unpretentious.  It is not a yuppie diner wanna-be, which is good.  The portions are generous, the prices reasonable, and the value good.  I have eaten at Mattie's several times and have never been disappointed.",
        "Not impressed! The meats were very salty! No refills on soft drinks! The filet was really dry! We were celebrating a birthday and the dessert wasn't comped? Extremely over priced!!!!! \\nNot worth your money! I went to the fiesta casino buffet and paid $6.99 and had better cuts of beef than here!!!!",
        "The food is WAY too salty and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour for our orders. I would understand if the place was busy but it wasn't. Beyond annoyed. All we got was soup and burgers. They had to redo the burgers because they overcooked the first batch.",
        "This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again.",
        "I decided to give this place another try. It was a mistake. They were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case. Service was average. My friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned.",
        "This place has a very pleasant environment. Lots of TV's.  Patio area is very well connected to the inside of the restaurant. Service is good but the best of all is the food.  Every dish I order is good and for appetizer the fried caramelized brusselsprouts are the best.",
        "Absolutely love this place! You instantly feel at ease and happy the second you walk in the door. Such a personable, fun and sincere staff! Dr.Ashley is a true master at what she does. This is the best Med Spa I've ever been to, and would love to spend every day there, as they're not only fun to talk to, they know how to make you look and feel beautiful!\\nThey also have great specials and their prices are really affordable.",
        "Just cruising through the shops at Mandalay Bay. We decided to grab some grub at this place. We came during the happy hour and were glad we did. The chips and salsa were good. We had the plate of pork nachos and the grilled corn. I loved the mayo butter they grilled on the corn. I would definitely suggest  that as an appetizer. And gotta love buy one get one free margarita happy hour. I enjoyed my experience and will come back.",
        "the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy",
        "So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!",
        "Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.",
        "Our experience at the Fig Tree was truly enjoyable. Visiting from out of town, we were happily surprised to stumble upon it. The atmosphere was homey, welcoming with a touch of Southern hospitality. We started out with a great bottle of Meritage and fresh bread with rosemary infused olive oil. We had a great pasta and an awesome filet mignon with yummy fingerling potatoes. We highly recommend this restaurant.",
        "My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).\\n\\nAll attractions/games were in good working condition.",
        "Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree.",
        "Very healthy meals. The meal was cooked so well making me clean the plate easily. Thai iced tea is really good! We got summer sorting rolls for appetizer and it was so fresh and mouthful. Gorgeous setup as well. I had #17 and my partner had the pad Thai. It was delicious and the vegetables were completely fresh! Highly recommended",
        "\\\"Tourist trap\\\" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more.",
        "Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :)\\nSushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!",
        "BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "Mediocre sports bar. The place is clean and looks nice, but honestly there is nothing that really sets it apart from any other place around town.\\n\\nOne issue I have is the lack of selections for someone that eats vegetarian/vegan. Even some pretzel bites or hummus would be nice.",
        "not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....\\nThe Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :(",
        "After living in Brasil for 5 years I was very excited to try this place. I was thoroughly disappointed.  The price was way too much for their choice of meats. The night I went they weren't offering all their meats they claim to serve. Their salad bar had nothing authentic to Brasil. Quality of meat was mediocre at best. Price way too much for what you get.",
        "This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.",
        "I came into WILD after the gym and had dinner at the bar. The salad I ordered came out fairly quickly while the pizza took half an hour. I liked the smoked tofu in the salad but the dressing was too sour. The ingredients on the pizza worked really well together but there was too much lemon vinaigrette on top which overpowered the goat cheese and the caramelized onions.",
        "Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it",

        "Ribeye steak was so salty I could not eat it. To make it worse they did not take it off the bill.  So I ate $100 dollars worth of mac an cheese which was not very good either. My friend had the filet which was ok. I would not suggest this place to anyone.  The only thing good was the bread.  We did not see our waiter after he served us for 35 minutes when he asked if I wanted a desert since I could not eat the steak.",

My co worker and I split a cheese and meat appetizer which was also very tasty! It's a family business and we even got to talk to them, very nice and helpful! Recommended highly!",
        "We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently.",
        "Changing menu based on available good stuff, bar marco has that old world italian simplicity down with a great palate. Everything we tried was top notch. New owners make it more open and with a friendly but slightly classy atmosphere, but it's not a place you go in if you are in a rush. Like in Italy...take your time here.",
        "I am from Jersey.  I know good pizza.  This was just okay.  This place did well in a pinch.  But not saying much.  It's frickin PHOENIX, not exactly a hotbed of pizza choices.  I had a red creme Barq's though.  That was the best part.",
        "the viet pad thai is yummy and any of the soups too.  the owners are very personable and the customer service is wonderful.  i had no idea it was even called noodles ranch because the sign on top says something like \\\"vietnamese cuisine\\\".  and i love how it's noodles plural instead of singular.  that gave it the 5th star for me.",
        "Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return.",
        "We were very excited to go to Jasmine after reading the reviews.  Big disappointment.  Overly salty, nearing inedible. Rude waiter.  Short and impatient with my wife, our order, overall experience. Will not be back.  Better service and treatment at restaurants half the price.",

        "Spendy but the views are stunning, especially if you're lucky enough to get a table facing the Bellagio and it's spectacular fountain show.

        "Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky.",
        "This place is awesome! We were visiting from hawaii and we got to meet Ramona and the staff... they were very friendly and the food was great. We all (4 )ordered different things and it was to die for. We don't have this kinds of stuff here in hawaii so it was a treat for us! We will be back here for sure next time... don't worry ramona, we will be sending you a postcard soon!",
        "Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.",
        "Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Four hours later we both became violently ill and had to stay the next twenty four hours in our hotel room, making this our worst Vegas trip ever.

        "I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed. The bread was dry and stale and the whole sandwich crumbled apart. My coworkers got wraps and seemed to like them, but I probably won't order from here again.",
        "Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",

We had a roast turkey panini with salad (great interesting salad)--delicious and a local pork shoulder press panini with fries---super delicious flavor.  Portions were very substantial,  service was spectacular as was the view of the Scottsdale Airport.  Airport parking was FREE---what an extra treat!  A fun place to take someone for a different lunch!",
        "Calamari was ok, breaking was that crispy but overall it was good.  Ordered New York style because it was the special.  Not impressed with the crust. Usually the crust is nice and crispy.  This time it seemed like there was too much sauce because the crust was soaked and chewy.  Sauce and cheese were good.  Still hasn't swayed me. Metro is still totally worth it.",
        "I always stop in here when I'm in Vegas.  It's always busy regardless if I arrive at 11:00am or 10:00pm.  That's how I know it's good.  Ordered tacos al pastor & carne asada.  Best tacos in Vegas as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE",
        "Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food.",
        "Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!",
        "Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly",
        "For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)",
        "I have been here several times and they have the best cheesesteaks. I was not impressed with the mexican food I ordered, but the classic cheesesteak with onion is the best, and don't forget onion rings.",
        "Ordered for delivery and it took over TWO HOURS to get the food, which was cold AND not what I ordered.  A trifecta of incompetence. Don't do business here.",
        "I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.",
        "went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \\\"lobster tails\\\" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",
        "Staff - friendly\\n\\nOnsite urgent care - good. \\n\\nprescription filling ability - awful.  Don't have a prescription filled here. They either 1) don't receive it all or 2)  get it wrong.  Seriously.  Don't.  It's not worth the headaches.",
        "Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left  a booths seat  dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it.  Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted.\\n\\nIf you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste... I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",
        "so excited to try the cronuts. I drove all the way to get here but definitely not worth the effort. Cronuts were so hard and the chocolate filling is the worst chocolate filling i have ever tasted. I also ordered a caramel latte and oh my God! I never thought someone can screw up a latte like that! Never will I go back to this place.",
        "Although my tab was 200$ for two people... The food was really good. We ordered the lobster curry, tuna tartare, and some pasta dish. The prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. We also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! Ouchhhh. All in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.",
        "The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.",
        "I ordered the eggs rancheros. The tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick. My friend had the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.",
        "I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!",
        "I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, if the cost was a little more reasonable, I think I would prefer their mock meat over the real thing most of the time!  Definitely would recommend it to anyone to try.",
        "I ordered the Chicken Fajitas which were average.  The food is nothing special and the service is very slow.",
        "The mac and cheese and the ginger gin drink was great. My wife didn't like whatever chicken dish she ordered but we'll be back.",
        "Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \\\"ok. Have a good night\\\". Thats it. We won't return.",
        "The food is usually good.  The imitation crab meat was a huge disappointment.  The service is always too slow at lunch time.  The staff needs to understand that when people are coming for lunch during work that they should promptly bring their food, drinks, and check.  Many times the staff is congregated in the back talking while people are staring them down waiting for service.  It's a shame.",
        "Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",
        "Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there",
        "What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality.",
        "The nacho selection did not impress me I like real cheese on my nachos bummer. \\n\\nI ordered the chips and salsa, chips were bathed in salt and only one salsa was tasty. I went for the burger as my entree which was actually pretty good.",
        "Turkey avocado on French country will change your views on what a sandwich is capable of...it's that good. Top it off with raspberry bread pudding and your taste buds will thank you profusely:)",
        "One of my favorite \\\"cheap eats\\\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo",
        "The bar tenders are always super nice and friendly. I've eaten at this location about ten times, and the food is yum. However, I feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food. I usually eat in the restaurant, but the one time I ordered curb side to-go, they messed my order up.",
        "I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!",
        "This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!",
        "We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon (very small dish), corn (didnt care for it much), lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",
        "Meat has decreased in quality over last couple of years. Lukes, step up your game.",
        "The Market By Jennifer's is one of my recent favorites. Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!",
        "A big fat disappointment.\\n\\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\\n\\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!",
        "Excellent selection of pastries, including chocolate almond croissants.  \\n\\nBoth the pistachio and the pistachio almond croissants are filled with pistachio creme/paste (delicious!)\\n\\nThere is a Lafleur nearby, in case anyone wants poutine before or after...",
        "We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby,  Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it.  The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!",
        "Ordered a Red Dragon (minus the Crab mix add additional Spicy Tuna) (Great - this one was my Favorite) and the Tuna Lovers (Good) - the fish was fresh and both rolls were very tasty! I'll be back!",
        "The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.\\n\\nI can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?",
        "They make cupcakes now! Gluten free, soy free, vegan cupcakes. I asked Ginger \\\"If there's no wheat or soy, what the frak are they made of?\\\" and she said \\\"Love.\\\" And you know what, based on how delicious those cupcakes are, I believe they just might be.",
        "I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.",
        "Good food,  extremely good value,  a little more spice than I can handle in dishes I wouldn't expect it from.\\n\\nSlightly disappointed as we had come up to try the naan and it's no longer on the menu. \\n\\nI'd have given five stars,  but we ordered rice and it never came.",
        "I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias.\\n\\nIn the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",
        "Sorry but I have a different opinion. They give you mostly hard meat. Not real meat and it's not worth the price",
        "Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core.",
        "The food was horrible. I ordered the Red, White and Blue Slam with a side of bacon. The blueberry pancakes tasted like they were reheated in the microwave and dry, the bacon was burnt, refried and full of grease and my plastic cup of water had brown stuff stuck at the bottom. This is my first and last time here.",
        "Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\\n\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nGood portions.\\n\\nAffordable.",
        "At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.",
        "Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.",
        "I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit.",
        "I have been here several times and they have never gotten my order right. I have never actually had something there that was cooked the way I ordered it. They even forgot the salad I ordered one time until the waitress brought the check. The last time I went my husband and I both got sick off the food. The atmosphere is fun, but that's about all it has going for it.",
        "I was disappointed.  The meat was very bland and I like my meat med well.  They always had med to med rare.  Fish was pretty good without the sauce.  To me the best thing was the mash potatoes and Caesar salad.  Atmosphere was nice service was good but we will never go back again.  Definitely not worth 100 price tag.",
        "Ate breakfast with friends.  The french toast was overwhelming!  More than any one person should eat!  The bacon is the best in town.  Compares favorably with ihop across the street and would pick indy over a chain anytime.\\n\\nWill go again if just to try the bacon doughnuts!",
        "Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.",
        "An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",
        "Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.",
        "Really enjoyed the food and service. Delicious ribs and brisket. Mac & cheese was different, but very tasty. The owners were extremely attentive and friendly. Very reasonable prices...four of us ate for less than $40. Go try it out and support a local business",
        "While they did have a gluten free selection the crew did not seem to have good communication. Some items I ordered were missing and had to be reordered. That makes me wonder about whether the gluten free information was clear. No issues after so I guess it was ok. The food was reasonably good but offered no delight beyond the expectation of a competently cooked meal. Maybe if we had not been the last clients....",
        "Best selection, cuts and QUALITY of meats in the city. The NY Strip and delmonaco are outrageous... Now THAT'S what a steak is supposed to taste like...!",
        "Very pleasantly surprised....it was good!\\nI had a black bean crispy noodle with beef...a little spicy and very tasty....the portions were very generous.  Ordered a won ton mein for my husband...again, generous portion and tasted very authentic...meaning, like the kind of Chinese won ton mein we eat at home...\\nPeople were nice and prices seemed to be fair.",
        "The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.",
        "After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  \\n\\nI ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.",
        "Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday.",
        "Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.",
        "I am disgusted that I succumbed to eating here, but I was starving and there was no place for me to grab food until I landed in Austin. Unfortunately, Sbarro happened to be the first restaurant that I saw after I landed in Charlotte. I ordered a slice of pizza, a spinach roll, and a water. I left $16 poorer and queasy. P.S. staff is rude.",
        "Went to Joes this morning! First off after about 3 mins of sitting down i got to meet Joe and shake is hand! He is awesome and was sold on the place after that. I ordered the combo with two eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon it was great! The wait staff is super courteous and attentive. Will be going back many times to this place!",
        "Oatmeal Cookie Yogurt????  It is the best I have ever had.   I have been at least 3 times a week for the past month!  I hope its low fat, but really I don't care, its worth it.  I love this place, the people are friendly and very helpful!  I will be visiting again tomorrow!!",
        "I went here for breakfast. Waiters at a buffet? Oh they want a tip right. They don't even let you get your own drinks. I mean if someone drinks like five orange juices (hangover) then they may get a deal ha ha.  I was disappointed. I got eggs and a frozen yogurt sundae. This was all food I could have found ten years ago at my college dorm cafeteria.  I expected something special and didn't find it.",
        "I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \\\"I love Burgers\\\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",
        "Just opened, I will give them them the benefit of the doubt cause there other counterpart on charleston, not as good service could be better, layout is nice, ordered the burger, fries where great burger was burnt on the outside despite ordering med well, either they over used a blow torch or didn't clean the stove.",
        "Great new frozen yogurt spot! There is a lot of choices here! you make your own selection of yogurt and choose from a wide variety of toppings.  The seating  area had some fancy space cadet chairs but not enough chairs and tables for the amount of customers.  Over all Oh Yogurt was a very clean and inviting place to enjoy a cool treat!  I would recommend to others  to try and I would definitely return.",
        "felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "We dined at Grotto last Sunday for lunch and, like our last visit, it did not disappoint.  \\n\\nWe had the Lobster Bisque and Spaghetti & Meatballs.\\nBoth were good.  \\n\\nThe grilled Chicken and Marinara sandwich is also delicious too. Try it if you come here. You won't regret it. \\n\\nThey also have good salads. \\n\\nAnother excellent visit.",
        "This place was aaaallright. The menu was very interesting and I see how it sets itself apart by being a vegan restaurant. I got their house salad, but it was toooo overdressed and the spice in it was overbearing. I just ate it to eat it. But I will say their sundaes are good and great portion sizing for $5. It had an interesting flavor but I would definitely come back just for that.",
        "Breakfast was decidedly underwhelming. My husband's bfast sandwich was average at best and my egg burrito was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were burned, almost black, and tough. How do u make eggs tough??? Service also horrible. The guy serving us was not familiar with the menu, we had to flag him down for more coffee, and would someone please buy him a personality?!"

        "I'll admit that this location is extremely efficient and fast with the prep and the service is decent. The downside is that they do not participate in the $5 footlong monthly promotions anymore. I didn't realize that this was even an option for Subway restaurants! \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was beyond disappointed when I found this out after stopping at this location.",
        "Great food, huge menu with a good selection. Tuesday's are 4 tacos for $10, great deal! Service was a little slow but everything else was very good",
        "Every detail here is right. The office staff are pleasant and very helpful. It took a while to sort out my odd insurance, and they were patient and persistent. Dr. Rapp and the dental assistants have a warm, welcoming manner that puts the children (and me) at ease. After one rather difficult appointment, Dr. Rapp called the next day to check on my daughter and make sure she was feeling well.",

        "Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.",
        "I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok.",
        "Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions",
        "We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.",
        "So funny! Entertaining. Amazing. and very intriguing! I do not want to spoil the event with specifics!

        "A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again.",

I've also been to the Scottsdale Quarter location, and although the atmosphere is much more hip at this location, the sushi was not as fresh as the Old Town location. Go asap and order the Godzilla roll !! It's monstrous and delicious and you will be stuffed full when you leave !!!",

Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.\\n\\nEasy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.",
        "Went Wednesday night at 9 pm very busy and always good!",
        "Good strong fresh coffee. Cool but still friendly staff. Unhurried vibe. Super cute decor. Love it here",
        "This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.",
        "Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!",
        "Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",
        "Good local place with no snottsdale attitude.  Cheap drinks & a funny crowd.\\nI read the 2 star review below & you have to consider the source- a high heeled pizza eating girl who gets miffed because she has to go to the bar & get her drinks.\\nGo back to Club Douchey, princess.",
        "Decent sushi. Their unagi (BBQ eel) is terrible and that's my favorite. The salmon and other rolls are good.",
        "No options for egg free hamburger bun!  Was told by the manager that all of the buns contain egg, so my son was unable to order a burger.  We opted to not eat here as a family, since they were unable to accommodate him.  Sad that restaurants are not willing to take allergens into consideration when creating the menu and offer options.",
        "Affordable cakes and pastries, good portion we can't even finish it, good service. My daughter loves this place, her face lights up everytime we come here because she has difficulty to choose the cake that she wants but she always ended up with the ones with strawberry or raspberry on it. The cakes are not overly sweet, very fresh, and smell good, too! The napkins have paris hotel logo on it, really cute! we will be back..",
        "The asada tacos are so good! The best I've had in Vegas. Just order them the way they come. Only $2 each, and the service was super quick even though they were really busy.",
        "This is probably the worst Sushi I've ever eaten In Las Vegas.\\nWe ordered two chicken teriyaki's they came cold like someone had cooked them long time ago and hard like the plates.\\nI order food with no shellfish; they brought it with selfish.\\n\\nThe service is horrific;  I was embarrassed to bring my family here.\\nThe servers were mess and did not know what they were doing.\\nAbsolutely sad",
        "Went to Grand Lux cafe for breakfast.  Pretty good.  Service was great.  I had the eggs Benedict, was large so I only ate half.  My son said his fried chicken and waffle was delicious.  The hash browns were a little too soggy but other than that I have no complaints.  My waitress even made me some coffee to go!  Overpriced, but all hotel restaurants in Vegas are.",
        "This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.\\n\\nThe management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.",
        "I trusted the madison yelpers to help me find good restaurants and madison and buraka was among the very top there. Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad in any way, just a little bland and not inspiring. I've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago.",
        "Horrible, horrible place.  Wannabe Paris Hiltons abound as do the greasy Rico Suave guys with their striped, button down shirts (top buttons undone to expose their drain clogging chest mat.)  Semi-famous hockey players, people palming Benjamins, washed up celebrities (Britney for New Years?!  C'mON!) and the Pussycat Dolls get to cut in line.  Once you're in, you have no idea what all the fuss was about.",
        "OMG, I wasn't expecting such an amazing dining experience!  The service and waitress was superb!\\nThe Sushi was the freshest I have had in Pittsburgh & the General Tso's (which I order from almost every Chinese restaurant) was the best I have ever had.  Even had the option to get brown rice for no additional cost, this Dumpling House was the best!!!",
        "Ask for Teresa she shows what u need even if u don't...  Lol I was pretty specific about what I wanted, and her version was better than I wanted!  She called it \\\"Hong Kong\\\" hairstyle!  HAHAHAHAHA",
        "How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb.",
        "My wife and I stayed here during our Spring Training trip.\\nThis place is a little run down but good enough for spending  a few days. Close to Diablo stadium.\\nThe reason this is 3 instead of 4 stars is housekeeping. Our room wasn't ready until after 4 pm and each day housekeeping left a little to be desired.",
        "Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!",
        "We've been coming here since they opened and mangos never disappoints! The chips and salsa are to die for, and everything on the menu is delicious. The bean and cheese burrito, chicken soft tacos, street tacos, rice, beans and fresh juice are just a few of my favorites! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. It's truly a gem of downtown!",
        "Not bad. Decent sushi. The duck bim bi bap was good. Extra half star for having Orion at the bar. View of the waterfall is cool if you're into that sort of thing.",
        "It's a nice addition to downtown wait staff is dicey at best.  Weird happy hour times. Blue martini goes till 7 and commonwealth goes till 9 pm.  Downtown cocktail room goes till 7 to.  There happy hr ends at 6 pm.  Hello!! Give it a one and done.",
        "Last night we came to Canaletto for my 30th birthday! All I have to say is delicious! Food was amazing, service was great, and the view of St. Marks square was nice too. All around great experience. We will definitely be back.",
        "Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.",
        "This is definitely the worse beach club I have been to. Yeah its fun on certain days when Party Rock makes an appearance... otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small, dinky, and grimy pool!",
        "I am so dissappointed that PF Changs has removed the Salt & Pepper Prawns from the menu. My husband and I went there specifically  for this entree'. Too bad..... Not sure if we will return. We usually order the orange chicken with the shrimp. I guess we can get orange chicken anywhere.",
        "I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me.",
        "Since writing this review I've received two e-mails from Sushi Samba employees suggesting I return and that they are genuinely sorry that I had a bad experience and are sure it won't repeat.  \\n\\nMy question is:  Where was this level of service when I was eating there?\\n\\nLike hell I'm going to spend another hundred something dollars for them to prove to me that they don't suck.",
        "Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.",
        "I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha",
        "Used to be my go-to sushi joint for happy hour... That is, until I discovered Soho. There's nothing wrong with 808. It's just that, compared to Soho, there's no reason to go back to 808..",
        "Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.",
        "Four stars only because I almost never give five...but this was definitely a really good lunch experience.  A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.  This could become a regular in my lunch rotation....",
        "Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.",
        "Great service and environment. Brazilian & sushi can't go wrong. Order 3-4 items and share",
        "The sushi was good.  The service was ok.  We couldn't keep track of who was serving us...there were so many coming and going.  We didn't like that different rolls we ordered were all coming at different times, instead of all at once.  We stayed at the Wynn so it was right across the street and we gave it a shot.",
        "Ate here for lunch today. I had the sushi lunch sampler. Now I am throwing up and my stomach is churning. I would not recommend this place at all.",
        "It's like a tiny part of my years in Japan, or a stolen Post Street Japantown shopping area from San Francisco!  A nice selection of fresh food, Japanese sweets and cooking reagents, as well as various home products.  Did I mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi?  Good!",
        "Expect at least five flies flying around. Service has really gone downhill in the last year. Place is dirty and food quality is terrible. Previously they would offer their lunch special, now they try to push their regular menu on lunch patrons to make an extra buck. No longer one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. Never returning after last visit, lady owner was so rude. Eat at your own risk.",
        "You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.",
        "It looks like this place has a lot to offer, training, nutrition, smoothies. Today must have been an off day, unless this is just how business is conducted here, but I was never greeted, never acknowledged by the worker right in front of my face and felt completely overlooked. I understand there are other customers to be helped but a simple hello, I will be with you shortly would have sufficed.",
        "LOL, I love that I am considered a regular on Yelp here when I was in Vegas for a week. We stayed at our time share across the street and they gave us vouchers for the restaurants. If you couldn't tell by the fact that I am a \\\"regular\\\", we went there a couple times because the food was good and inexpensive. If we stay at the timeshare again, I will definitely be back to Big Sur!",
        "They accommodated to me and my friends very generously! I ordered teriyaki chicken and he used some of it to make a roll he thought I would like. I love the service, atmosphere, food, and especially the staff! A must go if you're in Vegas or looking for a new sushi place!",
        "Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat- great value. Staff very friendly, and kind. Service was moderately quick. Go there in the early hours of meal time to get the best service times.\\nWARNING- don't order too much of the rolls- they have huge servings.",
        "Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue.",
        "This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \\n\\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side.",
        "Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.\\n\\nVisiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.",
        "Let's face it, we all have our favorite sushi restaurant and we hate to waiver from what we \\\"know\\\".  Trust me, there is green grass on the other side.  This place has an amazing staff and sushi with a flare.  Hayley my server was the best.  Thank you!",
        "It was around 6 pm dinner time and they were out of a lot of food.  I then decided to order something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu which is mostly breakfast sfuff.  I figure I can wait for them to cook something from the \\\"anytime\\\" menu.  Well, the lady working said they weren't serving anything from that menu at that time.  Wtf????  Why do you have that on your menu then???  Get it together!!",
        "Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.",
        "This place seems to be cursed. No restaurants ever make it here long-term. However, the ambiance is very pleasant, with rustic, yet modern decor throughout. The food was above average but not great. With few Italian options in the old town area, I would return here again.",
        "For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location.",
        "The worst part of this airport is their designated recharge zones are cramped, awkward, and there's never any power outlets available. There are scattered power outlets in very strange places throughout the airport so if you see a bunch of unrelated travelers stand around a wall of open space, they have struck gold. Wi Fi is free!\\n\\nThere's a lot of cute little shops to look at including an oxygen bar, a chocolate shop, and random souvenir items.",
        "Ultimate hot dog spot! I've had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and they're all crazy good! I'm usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself. Plus Bird songs Mexi Cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me!",
        "The Piemaker boasts that it's sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry. \\nDouble pastry?!?!?!\\nToo perfect.",
        "the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy",
        "My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).\\n\\nAll attractions/games were in good working condition.",
        "Great meeting place for a family dinner, friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party. Really good skinny margarita! Their salsa is a little watery. The street chicken tacos are really good!",
        "Killer pizza!  If you are from the East Coast than it should be mandatory for you to eat here once a week!\\n\\nOutstanding garlic knots!",
        "Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :)\\nSushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!",
        "Sushi Combo B. Solid choice and value for lunch.",
        "Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.",
        "Was walking around the Paris Casino and came upon a bar thatwas hopping to find out their were dueling piano players. So we decided to take a listien for a few songs and wound up staying there for several hours. Anybody who can pull off Motorhead's \\\"Ace of Spades\\\" is great in my book. They were extremely funny and kept you interested and having fun all night!",
        "These were the best tacos on the east side that I've had. Very authentic and inexpensive. Nice people and the place is very clean. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur\\u00e9ed. I like it chunky. But that is no bug deal. I HIGHLY recommend people to try this place.",
        "I came out from California and was looking  for good Mexican food. What I found was a diamond in the rough. The tacos were great. The staff was on point and did a great job. Will be coming back."
